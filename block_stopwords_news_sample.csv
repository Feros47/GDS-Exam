technologies introduced iraq international oil companies using methods increase oilfield yields countries . given iraq ’ huge reserves , nation ’ oil industry certainly gain maximum benefit technologies . important new technologies directional drilling hydraulic fracturing , promise help boost iraqi production exports significantly . directional drilling 1970s , wells drilled vertically . , hole drilled straight downward reached oil , . , < num > several drilling companies developed techniques slant drilling , early form directional drilling allowed hole drilled slight angle . directional drilling equipment allows drill bit move curving line rather straight line , snake way around underground obstacles unusually hard rock formations . fact , given enough depth , wells drilled horizontally , , parallel surface land . first practical benefit directional drilling allows drillers reach oil reservoirs several miles away site drilling rig . current technology allows drillers drill far < num > miles away laterally . , example , directional drilling allows land-based rigs drill offshore locations , significantly reduces production expenses . , oil located steep mountains likewise tapped nearby flatlands . importantly iraq , directional drilling allows producers increase length underground pipe exposed reservoir . instead simply end pipe inserted oil reservoir , directional drilling fairly long perforated section pipe placed contact oil . critically important ensuring high flows well completed , since oil sucked much larger surface area . iraq directional drilling enables producers overcome sluggish flows resulted saddam ’ policy over-drawing oil wells reinjecting thick , undesirable residues back ground hopes obtaining short-term increases flow , mentioned . , directional drilling also makes possible multiple wellheads draw oil single drilling site , extended length perforated pipe exposed oil reservoir means greater yields . likewise , directional drilling also allows single wellhead draw oil and/or gas within several different geologic strata ( layers rock ) different depths , something impossible older perpendicular drilling methods . introduction directional drilling technologies helped iraq dramatically increase production , technologies hold promise even greater yields future . hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing , sometimes also called fracking , method stimulating wells produce oil . effectiveness fracking discovered series experiments < num > , first commercial application came < num > . although communities u.s. debated use fracking domestic production , iraq practice potential godsend may allow oil producers significantly increase wells ’ outputs . water containing suspension sand constituents injected high pressure well order create cracks oil-bearing rock . cracks allow oil flow freely within underground reservoir , therefore extracted . hydraulic fracture created underground

huge oil reserves long-term commitments international oil companies develop oil gas fields , iraq certain bright economic future . measured ever-increasing volume oil exports , country ’ oil industry fully recovered damage mismanagement suffered saddam hussein ’ reign . notwithstanding iraq ’ already-known reserves , seems likely recent new exploration efforts oil companies lead even greater tally iraq ’ oil wealth . ’ also important note iraq ’ blessed large reserves , also happens geologic formations holding iraq ’ oil much accessible drilling countries , means costs extracting oil much lower . significant iraq profitably produce petroleum prices less $ < num > per barrel . contrast , u.s. shale oil costs $ < num > $ < num > per barrel produce , even cost-effective wells texas generally
