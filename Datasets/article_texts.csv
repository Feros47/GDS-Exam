BBC Security Correspondent
Reporting fromRiyadh","US negotiators have held talks in the Saudi capital Riyadh with their Ukrainian counterparts and are separately meeting the Russians.
Washington's aim is to bring about an immediate partial ceasefire to the war in Ukraine, followed by a comprehensive peace deal.
So could these Riyadh talks produce the breakthrough so many are hoping for?
It depends who you listen to.
""I feel that he (Putin) wants peace,"" said President Trump's personal envoy Steve Witkoff, adding: ""I think that you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress.""
Yet Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman has dampened expectations. ""We are only at the beginning of this path,"" he told Russian state TV.
Kyiv suffered one of its heaviest attacks from Russian drones on Saturday night, with three people killed, including a five-year-old girl.
""We need to push Putin to give a real order to stop the strikes,"" said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in his evening address on Sunday. ""The one who brought this war must take it away.""
The Kremlin, meanwhile, seems to be in no rush to sign up to a ceasefire, with Vladimir Putin adding on numerous ""nuances"", or preconditions, before agreeing to the 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington and agreed to by Kyiv.
In Riyadh the US-Ukraine talks began soon after nightfall on Sunday, behind closed doors in one of Saudi Arabia's many luxury establishments, with the Ukrainian delegation headed by the country's defence minister, Rustem Umerov.
These, he said, were ""technical"" discussions, focusing on how best to safeguard energy facilities and critical infrastructure.
After the meeting, Umerov described the talks as ""productive"" in a post on X and said they were working to make Zelensky's goal of securing ""a just and lasting peace"" a reality.
Black Sea shipping lanes are also under discussion, with Russia reportedly keen to revive a deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain from its ports without being attacked, in exchange for relief on sanctions.
Both sides, Russia and Ukraine, have carried out hugely destructive attacks on each other's infrastructure - with a marked distinction.
Moscow has sought to plunge Ukraine's population into cold and darkness by targeting its electricity generation, while Kyiv has become increasingly successful in its long-range drone strikes that have struck Russian oil facilities critical to its war effort.
President Trump wants a quick end to this war, Europe's worst since 1945 and one which has led to combined casualties on both sides of hundreds of thousands of killed, captured, wounded or missing men.
Ukraine's leadership, still bruised from that catastrophic row in the Oval Office last month, is trying hard to convince Washington it is not the obstacle to peace.
When the Americans proposed a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire on land, sea and in the air at talks in Jeddah this month, Ukraine quickly agreed to the terms.
The ball, said the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the time, was now in Russia's court.
But despite the US failure to get Moscow to agree to that ceasefire, the Trump administration is putting little or no pressure, at least not in public, on Russia to fall into line. In fact, quite the opposite.
In an interview this weekend with the pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson, Steve Witkoff, the man spearheading the US drive for a ceasefire, appeared to take a stance totally at odds with that of Europe.
Ukraine, he suggested, was ""a false country"", Russia had been provoked and Putin was a man of his word who could be trusted.
Witkoff, a former New York real estate developer and golfing partner of Donald Trump, also dismissed Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to put together a military force to help safeguard an eventual peace deal in Ukraine, calling it ""a posture and a pose"".",Europe

Eastern Europe correspondent
Reporting fromPoeni, Romania","The Romanian village of Poeni has a couple of shops, a kebab grill and a pack of stray dogs.
It also has a fair few voters who wanted a far-right candidate to become president.
Poeni, just over an hour's drive from the capital, is not alone in that.
Last November, Calin Georgescu – who admires Vladimir Putin and is no fan of Nato – came from the extremist fringe to win the first round of Romania's presidential election with 23% of the vote.
In Poeni he did even better, with 24%.
Then the constitutional court scrapped the entire election in an unprecedented move, citing intelligence that Georgescu's online campaign had been boosted by Russia.
In Poeni, a young voter called those claims ""lies"", angry at the cancelled vote. ""They should have let him run to see what happens,"" Maria argues.
A new ballot will be held in May but Georgescu has been barred from participating.
In Bucharest, supporters who took to the streets yelled that the judges were destroying democracy. A handful clashed briefly with police, who used tear gas.
Now nationalist politician George Simion has stepped into the race and is polling strongly instead.
Many Romanians fear their country's core European values, and its global alliances, are still in danger.
""We are in the middle of a battle of ideas. We don't have options here,"" is how one democracy activist describes the mood. ""The fight is now.""
In Poeni village there's less talk of values and of Russian meddling, more about the money in their pockets. Or rather the lack of it.
By the side of the main road, where the traffic alternates between heavy trucks and horses and carts, men buy charred chunks of kebab and pensioners chat on dusty benches.
A metal public phone box is bent out of shape, its sign dangling as it probably has for years.
Incomes here are small, prices are climbing and life is tough as in much of Romania.
""I want Georgescu to straighten everyone out. They tricked us. They promised us more pension money,"" a middle-aged woman speaks quietly at first, then becomes bolder. ""The others have done nothing for us here!""
In the village store, Ionela is just as disenchanted.
""Young people finish college here and can't get work, so they go abroad. That isn't normal. We need our young people to have places here to work,"" she complains from behind the shop counter.
Millions of Romanians work elsewhere in the EU and send money home to their families. In Poeni you can see where some of that ends up, in all the half-done new homes.
Ionela's whole family voted for Georgescu. He promised to cut taxes, she thinks, but she doesn't seem to have registered his far-right ideology.
A man who's praised extremist figures from Romania's past, he's now under investigation for suspected links to a group with ""fascist, racist or xenophobic characteristics"".
Emerging after questioning, the politician was filmed giving a fascist-style salute.
Other villagers in Poeni did see that and do know all about the murky characters Georgescu has been linked to.
On hearing his name, one pensioner grabs her crutch and wields it like a machine gun, shouting that he is dangerous.
Another told me people were suspicious of someone who surged to prominence from nowhere and of his focus on sovereignty over economic sense.
""He tells us we don't need Europe to help us with money. So how are we going to live? Let's face it: Europe feeds us!"" she says.
Romania's vote has become the topic of talk far beyond the streets of Poeni, or even Bucharest.
When US Vice President JD Vance shocked Europe with a speech in Munich, claiming that the EU's greatest threat came from within and not from Russia, he cited Romania several times.
He declared that the country's election had been cancelled on ""flimsy suspicions"" under ""enormous pressure"" from the EU. Then Elon Musk slammed the court's move as ""'crazy"" on X.
Moscow would have enjoyed that.
Russia's external intelligence agency came out in full agreement with the US that the ""liberal mainstream"" in Europe was suppressing dissent.
This from an authoritarian regime.
""It's the new world we are living in. It's Maga ideology. They try to find partners and their partners are far-right parties in all Europe,"" is how journalist Ion Ionita sees the US-Russia alignment.
To him, annulling the presidential elections was not only constitutional but justified.
""We are living through a hybrid war, democracy is under pressure,"" he argues. The threat is real.
But Romania, which borders Ukraine and hosts a big Nato base, now has to deal with US hostility too.
""It's a dramatic change. America is our ally, the biggest one, and the most important security provider for Romania,"" Ion Ionis points out. ""We need this partnership to go further and to be stronger.
""People are worried.""
For Florin Buhuceanu the dispute isn't only political – it's personal.
His Bucharest flat, a modernist gem, is a mini museum ""dedicated to gay memory"".
On one wall there's a large photograph from the 1930s of three gay men under arrest. In the next room is a wooden cabinet that once displayed Romanian fascist-era memorabilia in an antique store. Now it contains pictures of gay icons.
Romania only decriminalised homosexuality in 2001.
""No state museum would take such donations,"" Florin says, so he and his partner display the exhibits at home for invited guests.
A prominent LGBT activist, he's had so many threats in the heat of this election campaign that the security services have warned him to be careful.
Even with Georgescu disappearing as swiftly as he appeared, the atmosphere is febrile.
George Simion, now considered a frontrunner, has been investigated after calling for election officials to be ""skinned alive"" for barring Georgescu from the race.
He describes his nationalist AUR as a ""patriotic party of conservative essence"" whose pillars are ""Faith, Nation, Family and Freedom.""
LGBT rights group Mozaiq has warned of a surge in anti-Semitic, racist and homophobic rhetoric in recent weeks. It had to alert police after social media messages urging attacks on its office.
So Florin Buhuceanu fears his country is being thrown back to the past.
""Before 2001, it was absolutely impossible for us to breathe. Now we hear again and again the same rhetoric,"" he says.
Worse still, the US, Russia and the Romanian far right now coincide.
""It's obvious that our rights are fragile and the world is regrouping, so we have to continue this battle,"" the activist warns. ""It's not just for our community. It's for the soul of Romanian democracy.""",Europe

Reporting fromRome

BBC News","Pope Francis has appeared at his window of the Gemelli hospital in Rome and offered a blessing for the first time since being admitted on 14 February.
The 88-year-old pontiff was discharged minutes later and doctors say he will need at least two months of rest at the Vatican.
During the past five weeks, he presented ""two very critical episodes"" where his ""life was in danger"", Dr Sergio Alfieri, one of the doctors treating the Pope, said.
Pope Francis was never intubated and always remained alert and oriented, Dr Alfieri said. Even though the Pope is not completely healed, he no longer has pneumonia and will return to work as soon as possible, if the trend continues, doctors say.
Mayor of Rome Roberto Gualtieri told the BBC he felt ""a really great joy, great emotion to see Pope Francis leaving the hospital"".
""It's a great gift to the city and to the world... we support him and feel really close to him,"" the mayor said.
A crowd of people gathered outside the hospital on Sunday, waiting for the Pope to appear.
""When I saw him I felt, to be honest, a little relieved,"" said Bishop Larry Kulick, from the Diocese of Greensburg in the US state of Pennsylvania. ""I felt just overjoyed to see him.""
""I cried all the time because the love we breathe in this little square of this hospital was like heaven,"" said Ilaria Della Bidia, a singer from Rome.
Ana Matos from Brazil said she ""just arrived from Brazil today"" and arrived outside the hospital ""30 seconds before he appeared"". She said that ""it was an amazing feeling, like when I had my son. I was so happy to see him healthy and I could see him smile"".
The Pope had only previously been seen by the public once since he was admitted to hospital, in a photograph released by the Vatican last week, which showed him praying in a hospital chapel.
Earlier this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City.
His voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers.
Pope Francis has spent 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church.
He has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21, making him more prone to infections.

Diplomatic correspondent•@BBCJLandale
Reporting fromKyiv","Sir Keir Starmer's plan for an international force to support a ceasefire in Ukraine has been dismissed as ""a posture and a pose"" by Donald Trump's special envoy.
Steve Witkoff said the idea was based on a ""simplistic"" notion of the UK prime minister and other European leaders thinking ""we have all got to be like Winston Churchill"".
In an interview with pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson, Witkoff praised Vladimir Putin, saying he ""liked"" the Russian president.
""I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,"" he said. ""He's super smart.""
Witkoff, who met Putin 10 days ago, said the Russian president had been ""gracious"" and ""straight up"" with him. Putin told him, he added, that he had prayed for Trump after an assassination attempt against him last year. He also said Putin had commissioned a portrait of the US president as a gift and Trump was ""clearly touched by it"".
During the interview, Witkoff repeated various Russian arguments, including that Ukraine was ""a false country"" and asked when the world would recognise occupied Ukrainian territory as Russian.
Witkoff is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with both Russia and Ukraine but he was unable to name the five regions of Ukraine either annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces.
He said: ""The largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions, Donbas, Crimea, you know the names and there are two others.""
The five regions - or oblasts - are Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimea. Donbas refers to an industrial region in the east that includes much of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Witkoff made several assertions that are either not true or disputed:
The US is set to hold separate talks in Saudi Arabia with Ukraine and Russia about a ceasefire at meetings over Sunday and Monday.
Ahead of that, Ukrainian authorities said Russia had launched drone attacks on Kyiv overnight, resulting in deaths of three people, including a five-year-old child.
Officials said that eight people had been injured.
Russia also struck the southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday, killing a family of three.
Meanwhile, on Sunday Russia's ministry of defence said it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones across a number of regions in the south as well as in Crimea, the peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.
During his interview, Witkoff also repeated several Kremlin talking points about the cause of Russia's full-scale invasion.
He said it was ""correct"" that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia: ""The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?""
He added: ""There's a sensibility in Russia that Ukraine is just a false country, that they just patched together in this sort of mosaic, these regions, and that's what is the root cause, in my opinion, of this war, that Russia regards those five regions as rightfully theirs since World War Two, and that's something nobody wants to talk about.""
Putin has repeatedly said that the ""root causes"" of his invasion were the threat posed to Russia by an expanded Nato and the sheer existence of Ukraine as an independent country.
Witkoff said in the Tucker Carlson interview: ""Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? They don't need to absorb Ukraine… They have reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they have gotten what they want. So why do they need more?""
Asked about Keir Starmer's plans to forge a ""coalition of the willing"" to provide military security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, Witkoff said: ""I think it's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic. There is this sort of notion that we have all got to be like [British wartime prime minister] Winston Churchill. Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two.""
He said a ceasefire in the Black Sea would be ""implemented over the next week or so"" and ""we are not far away"" from a full 30-day ceasefire.
He also gave details of how Trump wanted to co-operate with Russia after relations had been normalised. ""Who doesn't want to have a world where Russia and the US are doing collaboratively good things together, thinking about how to integrate their energy polices in the Arctic, share sea lines maybe, send LNG gas into Europe together, maybe collaborate on AI together?""",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw0w7147vo,Tates return to Romania to 'prove their innocence',2025-03-22T01:25:57.751Z,"Jack Burgess & Sofia Ferreira Santos
BBC News","British-American influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have returned from the US to Romania, where they face human trafficking and other charges.
Speaking to the press outside their house in Bucharest, the brothers said they were back because ""innocent men don't run from anything.""
""We've come here to prove our innocence because we deserve our day in court,"" Andrew Tate added.
The BBC understands the brothers will appear at a police station to register on Monday. They strongly deny the allegations against them.
Andrew Tate earlier told his 10.8 million followers on X that he had spent $185,000 (£143,000) on a private jet alongside his brother to ""sign one single piece of paper in Romania.""
The brothers, who are dual US-UK citizens, arrived in the US at the end of February after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban.
They told reporters they loved Romania and were ""never going to leave"" but would take holidays if and when they felt like it.
Andrew Tate, 38, is a self-proclaimed ""misogynist"" who claims to have made millions from social media despite being previously banned from platforms for his views.
He and Tristan, 36, are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.
The brothers are also the subjects of a separate investigation in the UK into allegations of rape and human trafficking.
In the US they face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They deny the allegations against them.
Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against the brothers had not been dropped and that they remain ""under judicial control"" - meaning they have to regularly report to the authorities.
However, their exit sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from US President Donald Trump's administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.
When asked about concerns surrounding US influence, the brothers rejected these claims.
""There's no American pressure, there's just the rule of law,"" the eldest brother told reporters.
The Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.
Earlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were ""extremely concerned"" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.
Andrew Tate was put under house arrest in Romania in August 2024 when prosecutors launched a second criminal investigation against him and his brother Tristan, as well as four other suspects. They all deny wrongdoing.
Separately, the brothers are wanted in the UK to face allegations of sexual assault, which they also deny.
The brothers have also been accused of tax evasion in the UK. A British court ruled in December 2024 that police could seize more than £2m ($2.6m) from them for failing to pay tax on £21m in revenue from their online businesses.
Andrew Tate said the ruling was ""not justice"" and called it a ""co-ordinated attack"".",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c743g135vj9o,US to import millions of eggs from Turkey and South Korea to ease prices,2025-03-21T23:14:47.350Z,"Brajesh Upadhyay
BBC News, Washington","The Trump administration is planning to import eggs from Turkey and South Korea and is in talks with other countries in hopes of easing all-time high prices for the American consumer, officials confirmed.
""We are talking in the hundreds of millions of eggs for the short term,"" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters at the White House.
It follows the administration's announcement of a $1bn (£792m) plan to combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has forced US farmers to cull tens of millions of chickens.
Despite President Trump's campaign promise to reduce prices, the cost of eggs has surged more than 65% over the past year, and it is projected to rise by 41% in 2025.
Rollins said her department was also in talks with other countries to secure new supplies, but did not specify which regions.
""When our chicken populations are repopulated and we've got a full egg laying industry going again, hopefully in a couple of months, we then shift back to our internal egg layers and moving those eggs out onto the shelf, "" she said.
Polish and Lithuanian poultry associations said on Friday they had also been approached by US embassies regarding possible egg exports, the AFP reported.
""Back in February, the American embassy in Warsaw asked our organisation whether Poland would be interested in exporting eggs to the US market,"" Katarzyna Gawronska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers, told the news agency.
In February, the US Department of Agriculture unveiled a $1bn, five-point plan to tackle the price of eggs, with a budget of $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programs.
The Trump administration said it will provide commercial egg farms with best practices and consulting services for free, and pay up to 75% of the costs to address vulnerabilities to help prevent the spread of bird flu.
""Our plan was to invest a significant amount of money to do audits across the country to have USDA help these egg laying companies to secure their barns,"" Rollins said. ""...and since we began doing that most recently, we've seen a significant decline in the bird flu.""
Though the avian flu, or H5N1, has circulated among American poultry flocks for years, an outbreak starting in 2022 has wreaked havoc on farms, killing more than 156 million birds and sending egg prices skyrocketing.
Egg prices became a rallying point for Trump in last year's presidential run as he sought to capitalise on voters' frustrations with the rising cost of essential items.
During his address to the US Congress earlier this month, he blamed the soaring egg prices on his predecessor Joe Biden.
""Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control - and we are working hard to get it back down,"" he added.
Egg prices rose as the Biden administration directed millions of egg-laying birds to be culled last year amid a bird flu outbreak, though prices have continued rising during the early stages of Trump's second presidency.",Europe

BBC News","Iceland's minister for children has resigned after admitting she had a child with a teenager more than 30 years ago.
Ásthildur Lóa Thórsdóttir said in a media interview she had first started a relationship when the boy was 15 years old, and she was a 22-year-old counsellor at a religious group which he attended.
She then gave birth to his child when he was 16 years old and she was 23.
""It's been 36 years, a lot of things change in that time and I would definitely have dealt with these issues differently today,"" the 58-year-old told Icelandic media.
Iceland's Prime Minister Kristrún Frostadóttir told the press this was ""a serious matter"", although she said she knew little more than ""the average person"".
""This is a very personal matter [and] out of respect for the person concerned, I will not comment on the substance,"" she said.
According to Visir newspaper, Frostadóttir said she had only received confirmation of the story on Thursday night.
She immediately summoned the Thórsdóttir to her office, where she resigned.
Icelandic news agency RUV broke the story on Thursday night.
Thórsdóttir revealed in an interview with them that she had met the father, who RUV name as Eirík Ásmundsson, while she was working at the religious group Trú og líf (Religion and Life), which he had reportedly joined because of a difficult home life.
He was 15 years old and she was 22 at the time of their meeting. Thórsdóttir gave birth to their son when they were both a year older.
RUV report that the relationship was secret, but that Ásmundsson was present at his child's birth and spent the first year with him.
However, the news agency writes this changed when Thórsdóttir met her current husband.
They report they have seen documents Ásmundsson submitted to Iceland's justice ministry requesting access to his son, but that Thórsdóttir denied it, while also requesting - and receiving - child support payments from him over the following 18 years.
A relative of Ásmundsson tried twice to contact the Icelandic prime minister about the relationship last week.
Frostadóttir said last night that when the woman revealed it involved a government minister she asked for more information, which led to the revelation and the resignation.
In her TV interview with RUV last night, Thórsdóttir said she was upset that the woman had contacted the prime minister.
""I understand... what it looks like,"" she said, adding that it is ""very difficult to get the right story across in the news today"".
While the age of consent in Iceland is 15, it is illegal to have sex with a person under the age of 18 if you are their teacher or mentor, if they are financially dependent on you, or work for you. The maximum sentence for this crime is three years in jail.
Despite resigning from her ministerial job, Thórsdottir said she had no plans to leave parliament.",Europe

BBC News","At least 15 people have been arrested in Austria and Slovakia accused of hate crimes aimed at the gay community, according to state police in southern Austria.
Some 400 officers took part in raids on Friday morning on behalf of the Graz public prosecutors office.
They arrested 12 men and three women, aged 14 to 26, who are accused of luring people - many gay - to remote locations using fake social media accounts, before beating them up and filming it.
""The group claimed that its actions were aimed at paedophiles,"" Styria state police wrote on their X page. ""In reality, the increasingly brutal acts were directed against the homosexual community.""
The perpetrators began luring people using social media accounts in May 2024. Police said the suspects ""acted under the guise of vigilantism"".
Masked men met tricked individuals in remote places and then filmed themselves beating, robbing and abusing the victims, police said. They then uploaded the footage to online groups.

Paris correspondent","The French government has been accused of censorship after it cancelled a book order for 800,000 copies of Beauty and the Beast, which were to be given free to children this summer.
According to Education Minister Élisabeth Borne, it is because the new illustrated version of the classic story was judged too grown-up for the 10 and 11 year-olds who would be reading it.
But illustrator Julien Berjeaut – known as Jul – said the ministry's objections were spurious, and that he feared the book was pulled because the characters he portrayed in it were dark-skinned.
""The only reason I can think of [for the cancellation] is the disgust some people felt at seeing princes and princesses who look a bit more like actual schoolchildren of today,"" he told France's Le Monde newspaper.
Jul believes the cancellation is because the characters in the new books have ""darker skin instead of blonde fairy-tale princesses.""
He added that it was ""as if [Donald] Trump and his team were in charge"".
The original Beauty and the Beast was written by French authoress Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in the 18th century, and tells of a merchant's daughter, Belle, who must live with an ogre in order to save her father's life.
Eventually – as viewers of the Disney film will know - Belle falls in love with the ogre and discovers he is in fact a prince.
Jul – who is known for his affectionally grotesque caricatures – was commissioned to give a modern take on the tale, with the book being the latest in a programme of annual gifts to French pre-adolescents.
In his illustrations (the text is the original), the merchant is a Mediterranean importer of illegal contraband and Belle's siblings are pampered teenagers gorging on social media.
According to a spokesperson at the ministry quoted by Le Figaro, ""the illustrations address themes which are unsuitable for children of that age – alcohol, social media, illegal trading and police checks.
""The father is an Algerian who drinks and does dodgy import-export. He's even arrested by police. Without explanation, this was bound to provoke a reaction from parents.""
The free book programme, which was launched seven years ago, is meant to encourage children to read at home, without the supervision of teachers or parents.
According to Borne, ""Jul has a lot of talent. He's good at irony, at not taking things at face value. But without accompaniment, [the book] is not adapted to the age-group.""
The ministry said there had been several meetings with Jul at which officials had raised concerns about the progress of the work, but he had failed to take account of their objections.
Oddly, in the last proofs of the book before it was withdrawn, the minister had actually added a preface, praising Jul's ""malicious touch and razor-sharp eye.""
The book will still be published, but not at the ministry's expense. French children this year will instead receive a version of Homer's Odyssey.",Europe

Reporting fromKyiv","Maria's life has been reduced to waiting for the next phone call from her husband - never knowing if it might be the last.
Ivan, a 31-year-old Ukrainian fighter pilot, began defending the skies from the very first hours of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and has now flown more than 200 perilous missions in his old Soviet-era Mig-29 warplane.
The squadron commander has lost several comrades in the war. Some were close friends. Others were godfathers to each other's children. The location of his current air base in western Ukraine cannot be revealed for security reasons.
But as US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire gather pace - and fresh talks with Russia and Ukraine planned on Monday - things have changed.
""If any ceasefire comes [about], we will feel safer,"" says Maria.
Across Ukraine, more and more people are openly talking about war fatigue. They're calling for an end to the most brutal fighting in Europe since World War Two, and for firm guarantees of Western protection to ensure Russia can't attack again.
At the same time, Maria fears that any deal could involve accepting the loss of four Ukrainian regions in the south-east partially seized by Russia, as well as Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. ""Nobody will give us back our lost territories"", the 29-year-old says. ""They will stay under Russian occupation.""
She asks: ""What [did] so many men, our heroes, sacrifice their lives for if Ukraine can't fight for them, and is forced to make concessions?""
When Maria and Ivan met, the prospect of a full-scale war in Ukraine seemed impossible.
Maria was an English teacher at a local children's club in western Ukraine attended by the daughter of one of Ivan's comrades. The comrade offered to set Ivan up with Maria, who he described as ""a very nice teacher"".
At first Ivan felt pressured by the arrangement - but he eventually agreed to come.
He was glad he did. They soon started seeing each other.
On one of their first dates, Ivan warned Maria he had a dangerous job. She said it wouldn't be a problem. Ivan was courageous, caring and protective, and Maria was falling in love.
He soon had to go on a long-term deployment far from home. They lost touch for a year, and it seemed like their relationship might be over.
But then he returned with a giant bouquet of flowers and promised her he didn't want to waste her time. Within a year, the two were married and they were soon expecting their first child.
It was only once Russia launched its full-scale invasion that Maria understood what he'd meant about the harsh realities of his work.
Their daughter Yaroslava was only three months old at the time. Ivan missed her early milestones: helping her take her first steps, seeing her first teeth come through and comforting her during her first illness.
""When Ivan is deployed far away from home, I send him thousands of our daughter's photos to help him feel that at least virtually he is spending the day with us,"" says Maria.
On one nearby mission, Maria put her daughter in a pram and rushed to a checkpoint where he could run out to catch them for five minutes.
She brought him home-made food. They talked. And found that every minute together was worth the months they'd spent waiting.
Before Yaroslava could even speak, she would use her tiny hands to gesture that her dad was flying through the skies.
""Our daughter knows that her dad is a pilot,"" she says. ""When she had a birthday and her father ate a birthday cake over a video call, we explained to her that he couldn't be with us as he was defending Ukraine from the Russians.""
The family now have a professional photo taken of them every six months. ""It's very hard for me to say but I have to be completely honest. We never know if it [will be] our final call or meeting,"" Maria says, on the brink of tears.
She feels she has to be ready for ""everything, including the worst-case scenario"".
During the first year of the war, she would regularly hear about casualties among friends. ""You call their wives and can't find the words to say. And you fear that one day, you may find yourself in the same situation.""
Ukrainians are seeking concrete guarantees of protection by the US and Europe, and an increased supply of Western fighter jets, to deter Russian aggression.
The country has received a number of US-made F-16s and French Mirage fighter jets, but the country's air force still largely relies on old Soviet-era warplanes – hardly a match for more advanced Russian aircraft.
Maria is cautiously hoping for a ceasefire. It might ""freeze"" the conflict at best, she says, but finds it difficult to rely on as she doesn't trust Russia.
Vladimir Putin wants an end to Western military aid to Kyiv and intelligence-sharing with the Ukrainians, as well as a halt to mobilisation in Ukraine.
Many experts say that his demands are simply a pretext to continue the war he launched, in spite of heavy Russian casualties.
There are also fears that Donald Trump – who has publicly stated that ending the war is one of his top priorities – could be preparing a behind-the-scenes deal with Russia which would force Ukraine to accept painful concessions.
Even after a ceasefire, Maria will still be waiting for calls and rare meetings, as the Ukrainian air force will have to stay alert for a long time.
And while there may be peace in Ukraine, she wonders if her husband will ever be at peace again. Maria says Ivan, who has been deeply affected by the fighting on the front line, has a ""patriotic soul"" and will continue serving even after the war.
Maria feels it is important for him to not feel the casualties were in vain, and remains hopeful that the Russian-held parts of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk will one day be returned.
The priority for Maria now is to reassure her husband and offer him optimism. She dreams of a future where her young family can finally start to rebuild their life in a home of their own, in their own country.
""My husband needs to know that we are always waiting for him.""",Europe

Reporting fromKyiv","When Donald Trump met President Zelensky in New York last September, the then US presidential candidate exuded confidence he could bring the war in Ukraine to an early end. ""If we win, I think we're going to get it resolved very quickly,"" he said.
How quickly he meant varied over time. In a TV debate a few days earlier, Trump had promised he would ""get it settled before I even become president"". This was an escalation on his previous commitment in May 2023 to stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency.
Trump has now been in office for more than two months and the penny may be beginning to drop in the White House that trying to end a conflict as bitter and complex as this may take time.
In a television interview last weekend, the US president admitted that when he promised to end the war in a day, he was ""being a little bit sarcastic"".
There are many reasons for the slower progress than Team Trump may have anticipated.
First, the president's belief in the power of his personal, one-on-one diplomacy may have been misplaced. He has long believed any international problem can be solved if he sits down with another leader and agrees a deal. Trump first spoke to Vladimir Putin on 12 February, an hour-and-a-half conversation he described as ""highly productive"". The two leaders spoke again on 18 March.
But it is clear these telephone calls failed to secure the immediate 30-day interim ceasefire Trump wanted. The only substantive concession he squeezed out of Putin was a promise to end Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, a commitment he is accused by Ukraine of breaking within hours of the call.
Second, the Russian president has made it clear he does not intend to be rushed. His first public comments about the negotiations came last week in a press conference that was a whole month after his telephone call with Trump.
Putin showed he was resolutely opposed to the US two-stage strategy of seeking an interim ceasefire before talking about a longer-term settlement. Instead, he said any talks must address what he sees as ""the root causes of the war"", namely his fears an expanding Nato alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state somehow present a threat to Russia's security. He also set out detailed questions and conditions that must be answered and met before any deal could be agreed.
Third, the US strategy of directing its initial focus on Ukraine may have been misjudged. The White House came to the belief that President Zelensky was the obstacle to peace. Western diplomats acknowledge the Ukrainian government was slow to realise just how much the world had changed with the arrival of Trump.
But the US pressure on Kyiv that led to the now infamous confrontation in the Oval Office - when Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, harangued the Ukrainian leader - consumed time, effort and political capital.
It also ruptured transatlantic relations, setting Europe and the US at odds, another diplomatic problem that took time to settle. All the while Vladimir Putin sat back and enjoyed the show, biding his time.
Fourth, the sheer complexity of the conflict makes any resolution hard. The Ukrainian offer was initially for an interim ceasefire in the air and at sea. The idea was that this would be relatively straightforward to monitor.
But in last week's talks in Jeddah, the US insisted any immediate ceasefire should also include the more than 1200km-long front line in the east. Instantly that made the logistics of verifying any ceasefire more complicated. This, of course, was then rejected by Putin.
But even his agreement to the more modest proposal - to end attacks on energy infrastructure - is not without its problems. It is the details about that proposal which will occupy much of the technical negotiations that are expected to take place in Saudi Arabia on Monday. Military and energy experts will draw up detailed lists of potential power plants – nuclear or otherwise – that might be protected.
They will also try to agree which weapons systems should not be used. But agreeing the difference between energy and other civilian infrastructure may take some time. Remember: Ukraine and Russia are not talking to one another; they are engaging separately and bilaterally with the US which is promising to shuttle between both sides. This again adds to the time.
Fifth, the US focus on the economic benefits of a ceasefire distracted attention from the priority of ending the fighting. Trump has spent time trying to agree a framework deal giving US firms access to Ukrainian critical minerals. Some saw this as the US investing in Ukraine's future - others as it extorting the country's natural resources.
President Zelensky argued initially he could agree a deal only if the US promised to provide Ukraine with security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. The White House refused, saying the presence of US mining firms and workers would be deterrent enough. Eventually Zelensky conceded defeat and said he would agree a minerals deal without security guarantees. But despite that, the US has yet to sign the agreement, hoping again to improve the terms, possibly by including access to or even ownership of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.
Ending wars can be complex and time consuming. We would not have got to this stage without Trump's pushing, but progress has not been as quick or simple as he believed. In December 2018, as he campaigned for the presidency, Volodymyr Zelensky suggested negotiations with Vladimir Putin would be quite straightforward. ""You need to talk in a very simple way,"" he told the Ukrainian journalist, Dmytro Gordon. '""What do you want, what are your conditions?"" And I'd tell them: 'Here are our points.' We would agree somewhere in the middle.""
Well, on the evidence of the last two months, it may be harder than that.",Europe

Defence correspondent
Reporting fromSumy, Ukraine","Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha.
He shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles.
A soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going.
Artem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them.
Another truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames.
Artem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was ""not well organised"".
""It was pretty chaotic,"" he tells me. ""Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late.""
It wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia.
The 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time – even if for many it was on foot.
But he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements.
While Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that ""absurd"".
""To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,"" he says. ""Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously.""
Artem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. ""What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?""
Artem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy.
Ukraine is continuing its cross-border raids – not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too.
Serhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks – finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as ""dragon's teeth"".
We joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border.
Serhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory.
Travelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras.
His own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target.
Our original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller.
He and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path – remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange.
Serhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs.
The Bradley commander confirms to me that they've been fighting in Russia. He describes the situations across the border as ""difficult, but we're holding on"".
The Bradley is another reminder of Ukraine's reliance on US military support. That now seems less certain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy says it's already clear to him that there's ""haggling behind Ukraine's back"".
I ask Serhiy if he thinks European nations can fill any void left by the US. Is a European ""coalition of the willing"" enough to guarantee Ukraine's security?
""I think if America doesn't help Ukraine, then a ceasefire will be agreed soon - but on extremely unfavourable terms for Ukraine,"" Serhiy replies.
""Europe clearly cannot resolve this conflict alone. They're not strong enough. They've been focussing on their own economies instead of thinking about security.""
Serhiy says he wants the war to end. Like many Ukrainians, he would like to see peace - but not at any price.

Diplomatic correspondent•@BBCJLandale
Reporting fromKyiv","The potential Western troop deployment to Ukraine being discussed in London should be described as a ""reassurance force"" rather than a ""peacekeeping force"", defence and diplomatic sources say.
Currently dubbed the Multinational Force Ukraine or MFU, it would be sent to the country to cement any ceasefire and encourage long-term confidence in the country.
The focus would be on providing Ukraine with air cover to keep its skies safe and a naval presence in the Black Sea to encourage trade.
The deployment of so-called ""boots on the ground"" - probably about 20,000 strong - would in terms of size not be big enough to enforce any peace.
Instead, the troops - provided by a so-called ""coalition of the willing"" - would most likely be deployed to protect cities, ports and major energy infrastructure.
One option being considered is that the MFU might not operate in the east of Ukraine near the front line to try to reassure Russia it poses no offensive threat.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin have said repeatedly they would not agree any ceasefire if European and other forces were deployed to Ukraine.
The sources say any multinational operation in Ukraine would not be a ""peacekeeping force"" and should not be described as such.
Peacekeeping forces - under the aegis of either the United Nations or Nato - traditionally are impartial, operate with the consent of both parties and use force only to defend themselves. The multinational force being discussed would very much be on Ukraine's side, there to help deter future Russian aggression.
At the moment, it is not expected that the multinational force on the ground would monitor any ceasefire. That would be done by Ukrainian troops on the frontline and Western surveillance assets in the air and space.
The sources also say the coalition troops would not be deployed to provide a so-called ""tripwire force"" - meaning a force smaller than that of the opponent, designed to deter an attack without triggering escalation - if Russia resumed its invasion of Ukraine.
They say the military impact of any allied deployment of about 20,000 troops would be limited compared to the number of troops on either side of the front line.
Ukraine has almost a million military personnel, Russia's army is even larger.
Much of the focus of Thursday's discussions is on how best any international force can provide Ukraine with assets it does not have, especially capability in the air.
So, there will be discussions about which countries can provide warplanes to keep Ukraine's skies safe during a ceasefire.
There will also be discussions about how to make the Black Sea safe for shipping. That may involve two components: how best to keep shipping lanes clear of mines and what kind of naval task force could provide a security presence in the sea.
The key uncertainty is whether the United States would provide any air, satellite or intelligence cover for any European force on the ground.
The US has thus far said it would not be willing to provide any military ""backstop"".
The European strategy for now is to stop asking the US and instead organise the best force and capability it can to ensure the security of Ukraine in the future. Once the details are agreed, then the UK, France and others would see if the European offer was substantial enough for the US to have a change of heart and agree to play some kind of role.
What all this planning depends on, of course, is some kind of ceasefire being agreed in Ukraine.
While the US remains optimistic, many in Ukraine remain sceptical that Russia even wants to end the fighting.",Europe

Europe editor•@BBCkatyaadler","""I joined the air force 35 years ago, aged 18, and went straight to Germany, based on a Tornado aircraft,"" says British Air Commodore Andy Turk, who is now deputy commander of the Nato Airborne Early Warning & Control Force (AWACS). ""It was towards the end of the Cold War and we had a nuclear role back then.
""After the War, we hoped for a peace dividend, to move on geopolitically, but clearly that's not something Russia wants to do. And now my eldest son is banging on the door to join the air force, wanting to make a difference too... It does feel a little circular.""
We are around 30,000 feet above the Baltic Sea, on a Nato surveillance plane equipped with a giant, shiny, mushroom-resembling radar, enabling crew members to scan the region for hundreds of miles around, looking for suspicious Russian activity.
Air policing missions like this - and Nato membership more broadly - have long made tiny Baltic nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (which neighbour Russia) feel safe. But US President Donald Trump is changing that, thanks to his affinity with Vladimir Putin, which has been evident since his first term in office.
Trump has been very clear with Europe that, for the first time since World War Two, the continent can no longer take US military support for granted.
That leaves the Baltics nervously biting their nails. They spent 40 years swallowed up by the Soviet Union until it broke apart at the end of the Cold War.
They are now members of both the EU and Nato, but Putin still openly believes the Baltics belong back in Russia's sphere of influence.
And if the Russian president is victorious in Ukraine, might he then turn his attention towards them - particularly if he senses that Trump might not feel moved to intervene on their behalf?
Ian Bond, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform, thinks that if a long-term ceasefire is eventually agreed in Ukraine, Putin would be unlikely to stop there.
""Nobody in their right mind wants to think that a European war is around the corner again. But the reality is an increasing number of European intelligence officials have been telling us that…
""Whether this is coming in three years or five years or ten years, what they are saying is the idea that peace in Europe is going to last forever is now a thing of the past.""
Russia's economy is currently on a war footing. Roughly 40% of its federal budget is being spent on defence and internal security.
More and more of the economy is being devoted to producing materials for war.
""We can see what the Russian economy is being retooled to do,"" observes Mr Bond, ""and it ain't peace.""
When you travel to windswept Narva, in northern Estonia, you see why the country feels so exposed.
Russia borders Estonia, all the way from north to south. Narva is separated from Russia by a river with the same name. A medieval looking fortress straddles each bank – one flying the Russian flag and the other, the Estonian. In between is a bridge – one of Europe's last pedestrian crossings still open to Russia.
""We are used to their tricks and their tactics,"" Estonian Border Police Chief Egert Belitsev told me.
""The Russian threat is nothing new for us."" Right now, he says, ""there are constant provocations and tensions"" on the border.
The border police have recorded thermal imaging of buoys in the Narva River that demarcate the border between the two countries being removed by Russian guards under the cover of darkness.
""We use aerial devices – drones, helicopters, and aircraft, all of which use a GPS signal – and there is constant GPS jamming going on. So Russia is having huge consequences on how we are able to carry out our tasks.""
Later on, keeping to the Estonian side, I walked along the snow-covered bridge crossing towards the Russian side and watched the Russian border guard watching me, watching him. We were just metres away from each other.
Last year, Estonia furnished the bridge with dragon's teeth – pyramidal anti-tank obstacles of reinforced concrete.
I've not heard anyone suggest Russia would send tonnes of tanks over. It doesn't need to. Even a few troops could cause great instability.
Some 96% of people in Narva are mother-tongue Russian speakers. Many have dual citizenship.
Estonia worries a confident Vladimir Putin might use the big ethnic Russian community in and around Narva as an excuse to invade. It's a playbook he's used before in Georgia as well as Ukraine.
In a dramatic indication of the growing anxiety, Estonia, alongside Lithuania and Poland, jointly announced this week that they're asking their respective parliaments to approve a withdrawal from the international anti-personnel mines' treaty which prohibits the use of those mines, signed by 160 countries worldwide.
This was to allow them ""greater flexibility"" in defending their borders, they said. Lithuania had already withdrawn from an international convention banning cluster bombs earlier this month.
Camille Grand of the European Council on Foreign Relations, who is the former Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment at Nato, thinks that post-Ukraine, Putin would be more likely to target a non-Nato country (such as Moldova) rather than provoke a Nato nation – because of the lower risk of international backlash.
Estonia and the other Baltic nations were traditionally more vulnerable than the rest of Nato, as they were geographically isolated from the alliance's members in western Europe, according to Mr Grand. But that has been largely resolved now, since Sweden and Finland joined Nato, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
""The Baltic Sea has become the Nato Sea,"" he notes.
Dr Marion Messmer, a senior research fellow on the International Security Programme at Chatham House, thinks the most likely trigger for a war with Russia would be miscalculation, rather than design.
If peace is agreed in Ukraine, Dr Messmer predicts that Russia will probably continue with misinformation campaigns and cyber warfare in Europe, as well as sabotage and espionage in the Baltic Sea. ""I think they are likely to continue with any kind of destabilising activity, even if we are to see a peace that's positive for Ukraine.""
Dr Messmer continues: ""One of the risks I see is that essentially an accident could happen in the Baltic Sea that's completely inadvertent, but that's essentially a result of either Russian grey zone activity or Russian brinkmanship where they thought they had control of a situation and it turns out they didn't. That then turns into a confrontation between a Nato member state and Russia that could spiral into something else.""
But Mr Grand was keen not to totally downplay the risk of Putin targeting the Baltics.
Presumably, the Russian president would first mull how likely Nato allies would be to retaliate.
Would the US, or even France, Italy or the UK, risk going to war with nuclear power Russia over Narva, a small part of tiny Estonia, on the eastern fringe of Nato?
And suppose we were to see a repeat of what happened in the Donbas in eastern Ukraine in 2014 when Russian paramilitaries engaged in fighting did not identify as Russian soldiers? This allows Putin plausible deniability - and in those circumstances, would Nato wade-in to help Estonia?
If they didn't, the advantages for Putin might be tempting. The unity principle of the western military alliance he loathes would be undermined.
He'd also destabilise the wider Baltics, probably socially, politically, and economically, as a Russian incursion – however limited – would likely put off foreign investors viewing this as a stable region.
Another concern that has been discussed in Estonia is that Donald Trump could end up pulling out, or significantly reducing, the number of troops and military capabilities the US has long stationed in Europe.
Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur put a brave face on things when I met him in the capital Tallinn: ""Regarding (US) presence, we don't know what the decision of the American administration is.
""They have said very clearly they will focus more on the Pacific and they've said clearly Europe has to take more responsibility for Europe. We agree on that.
""We have to believe in ourselves and to trust our allies, also Americans… I'm quite confident that attacking just even a piece of Estonia, this is the attack against (all of) Nato.""
""And this is the question then to all the allies, to all 32 members,"" Pevkur adds. ""Are we together or not?""
This new and nagging sense of insecurity, or at least unpredictability, in the Baltics and Poland – what Nato calls its ""eastern flank"", close to Russia – is evident in the kind of legislation being debated and introduced around the region.
Poland recently announced that every adult man in the country must be battle ready, with a new military training scheme in place by the end of the year. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has also expressed interest in a French suggestion that it share its nuclear umbrella with European allies, in case the US withdraws its nuclear shield.
Voters living in the Baltics don't need persuading to devote a large proportion of public money to defence. Estonia, for example, is introducing a new law that makes it mandatory for all new office and apartment blocks of a certain size to include bunkers or bomb shelters. .
Tallinn also just announced it will spend 5% of GDP on defence from next year. Lithuania aims for 5-6%, it says.
Poland will soon spend 4.7% of GDP on defence – it hopes to build the largest army in Europe, eclipsing the UK and France. (To put that in perspective, the US spends roughly 3.7% of GDP on defence. The UK spends 2.3% and aims to raise that to 2.6% by 2027.)
These decisions in countries close to Russia may well be linked to a hope they have not yet relinquished, of keeping Trump and his security assurances onside. He repeated this month his previously stated position: ""If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them.""
As for how much annual spending would be considered ""enough"" for the Trump administration, Matthew Whitaker, Trump Nominee for U.S. Ambassador to NATO, declared ""a minimum defence spending level of 5%, thereby ensuring NATO is the most successful military alliance in history.""
With mixed messages from Washington, Estonia is looking increasingly to European allies for reliable support. The UK plays a big role here. With 900 personnel based in Estonia, it's currently Britain's largest permanent overseas deployment. And the UK has pledged to boost its presence.
At their base in Tapa, we found immense, echoey hangars rammed with armoured vehicles.
""You'll see the Challenger Main Battle Tanks as we head down to the other end of the hangar,"" explains Major Alex Humphries, one of the squadron leaders in Estonia on a six-month rotation. ""[They are] a really critical part of the capability. This is a really great opportunity for British forces.""
Asked if Estonia had approached the UK to ask for a bigger presence, as it was feeling more vulnerable, he told me: ""I think Nato at large feels exposed. This is a really important flank for our collective defence, the east. Everybody in the Baltics and in Eastern Europe feels the quite prominent and clear threat that is coming from the Russian Federation.
""We don't want this to come to war, but if it does come to war, we're fully integrated; fully prepared to deliver lethal effect against the Russian Federation to protect Estonia.""
Ultimately, though, unless they come under direct attack, the precise conditions under which UK bilateral forces or Nato troops will take military action comes down to political decisions made in that moment.
So Estonia is taking nothing for granted. That's why it is busy stress testing new army bunkers on its border with Russia and investing in drone technology. Though its armed forces wouldn't be powerful enough to repel an attack by Russia alone, Estonia is studying lessons learned from invaded Ukraine – whose fate Estonia really hopes it won't have to share.

Reporting fromBucharest
Rachel Hagan
BBC News","British-American influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have appeared at a police station after returning to Romania from the US.
The brothers registered with the authorities in the capital, Bucharest, in a legal formality to demonstrate their compliance with an ongoing criminal investigation.
They are under investigation in Romania for forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering. Andrew also faces allegations of rape and sex with a minor. The pair deny all accusations.
After leaving the police station, Andrew, 38, refused to say whether he would remain in Romania, but vowed to clear his name both there and in the UK.
The brothers returned to Romania on Friday nearly a month after they unexpectedly had their travel ban lifted by the authorities.
Soon after, the pair announced they flew on a private jet to Florida - where they quickly became the focus of a new investigation.
Florida's state attorney-general launched a criminal inquiry into the brothers, welcomed by the US National Centre on Sexual Exploitation, which represents one of Tate's alleged victims.
The brothers' exit from Romania led to speculation that prosecutors felt political pressure from President Donald Trump - whom they support. Trump has denied any knowledge of their release and the Tates have dismissed claims of outside influence.
Replying to a question about the US charges today, Andrew denied them and said: ""I am investigated everywhere on the planet, because I am one of the most important people on the planet.""
He also said there was a ""witch hunt"" against him.
The pair were arrested in Romania in late 2022 amid accusations of misleading women and transporting them to Romania where they were later sexually exploited and subjected to physical violence.
The pair are also the subjects of a separate investigation in the UK into allegations of rape and human trafficking, which they deny.
British authorities have secured a warrant over allegations of sexual aggression dating back to 2012, meaning the brothers could face extradition once Romanian proceedings conclude.
Last month, Romanian authorities warned the Tates they must return for a court appearance or risk ""a higher custodial measure"".
Andrew, who has been banned from several social media platforms for his misogynistic views and hate speech, later told his 10 million followers on X that he had spent $185,000 (£142,800) on a private jet to ""sign one single piece of paper in Romania"".
The BBC asked Andrew on Monday about his inflammatory tweets in the aftermath of the Southport attack in the UK last year in which three girls at a summer holiday dance and yoga class were stabbed to death and he falsely claimed the attacker was an illegal immigrant. Tate called the BBC correspondent ""a nobody"" before being driven away.",Europe

Mr Martin was in the Oval office for annual St Patrick's Day celebrations hosted by the US President when a reporter questioned him about O'Donnell's move from America to Ireland.
""Why in the world would you let Rosie O'Donnell move to Ireland? I think she's going to lower your happiness levels,"" the reporter enquired.
Micheál Martin laughed nervously as President Trump told the reporter: ""Thank you, I like that question.""
Speaking on The Late, Late Show on RTÉ on Friday night, O'Donnell claimed Trump had held animus towards her since an appearance she had on the American chat show The View in which she criticised his character and business acumen.
She said that since then Trump ""uses me as a punchline whenever he feels the need"".
""He's been doing it for two decades and I'm still not used to it every time he does,"" she said.
""But I felt very troubled that they put the taoiseach in that position and didn't treat him with the respect that a leader of that kind deserves when he's visiting The White House.
""I wrote the taoiseach with a little note apology to his email and got a note back that they had received it and thanked me.
""But I just wanted him to know the history and what happened and why he seems to be out to get me in ways that are startling to most.""
She also said the appearance of mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Conor McGregor in the Oval Office this week was ""very depressing"".
O'Donnell, who has Irish grandparents, said she moved to Ireland in mid-January.
She said while she had stayed in America during the first Trump presidency she found his second term ""terrifying"" as he now has ""the Supreme Court giving him ultimate power"".
O'Donnell said she had a plan with her therapist that if Trump was elected president ""which none of us thought was happening"" the plan was ""only [to move to] Ireland"".

Royal correspondent
Reporting fromEstonia","If royal visits are about sending a message, then the picture of the Prince of Wales in a tank near the Russian border must be one of the most direct.
Prince William has come to Estonia to support UK troops in what is now the British Army's biggest operational deployment overseas, defending the Baltic state from the threat of Russia.
On Friday, in a freezing cold, mud-churned military training area, the prince saw the soldiers and military equipment guarding Nato's eastern flank.
The prince, in camouflage uniform, peering from a Challenger 2 tank and then an armoured fighting vehicle, was sending a signal about the UK's commitment to deter any aggression from Russia.
During his two-day trip to Estonia, Prince William visited some of the 900 British troops in this multinational force, including soldiers of the Mercian regiment of which the prince is colonel-in-chief.
He was given a tour of the military training grounds at Tapa Camp - part of Operation Cabrit which is the UK's contribution to secure Nato's ""collective security and defence"" in this vulnerable Baltic region.
The prince, who was wearing a Nato badge on his uniform, was shown field training for this battlegroup, meeting Estonian and French troops too.
He asked soldiers about their deployment in terms of the ""context of being so near to Russia"" and wondered whether this felt more real than previous training.
This is what deterrence to Russia looks like on the ground - and the base shows how much the balance of power can shift.
Before Estonia regained its independence in 1991, this had been a base for Soviet air defences, with MIG fighter planes poised to take on the West.
Now the positions are reversed, with Estonian troops and their Nato allies located here to prevent a Russian incursion.
The strategically-important army base has been expanding, with the icy streets lined with military vehicles.
As well as riding in a Challenger 2 tank, the prince saw a Warrior armoured vehicle, a French Griffon fighting vehicle, a multiple launch rocket system, a Trojan vehicle for clearing obstacles and he drove an Archer mobile artillery system.
The war in Ukraine has shown how fast the technology of combat is changing and on Thursday the prince saw a hydrogen-powered drone, on a visit to designers in Estonia's capital Tallinn.
At the Tapa army base he asked soldiers about the new ""drone threat"" facing modern armies and ""the change of tactics"" that would require.
Around the base there were warning signs saying: ""Report drone sightings.""
The visit also focused on the wellbeing of service men and women who are posted here. Prince William asked whether there was still a stigma when it comes to talking about mental health problems in the armed forces. ""It's going in the right direction,"" welfare officer Amy-Jane Hale replied.
While touring the facilities, the prince managed to try his hand at pool and table football. That quickly became a game between his team Aston Villa and a supporter of their rivals Birmingham City.
On Thursday, hundreds of local Estonians waited in the cold to meet the prince in Tallinn, lining the railings to shake his hand or to take a selfie. He was warmly welcomed to this small, tech-savvy country, which increasingly relies upon its allies.
Estonia has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, sharing a border with Russia and having been under Soviet rule in the past. All around the capital there are Ukrainian flags flying alongside the Estonian blue, black and white tricolour.
Many Ukrainian families have taken refuge in Estonia. During a visit to a school in Tallinn for Ukrainian child refugees, Prince William praised Ukraine's strength.
""The Ukrainian resilience is everywhere,"" Prince William told the students. ""You have a very good spirit, very good souls, it's very important.""",Europe

Reporting fromIstanbul

BBC News
Reporting fromLondon","Police in Istanbul have used tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators in a second night of disorder after the arrest of the Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu - despite a four-day protest ban being in place.
Imamoglu - a member of the secular Republican People's Party (CHP) and a key rival of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - was set to be named as a presidential candidate for the 2028 presidential elections later this week.
On Wednesday, he was one of 106 people held on charges including corruption and aiding terrorist groups.
Since then, authorities in Turkey have arrested dozens of people for ""provocative"" social media posts.
Responding to the protests, Turkey's President Erdogan accused his political opponents of theatrics for taking part in a second night of demonstrations.
""They have lost the balance so much that they are in a state to attack our police, hurl threats at judges, prosecutors,"" he said.
Addressing a crowd of demonstrators outside Istanbul's city hall, Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Imamoglu's CHP party, accused the government of attempting a ""coup"" and said people had the right to protest.
But government officials have criticised the opposition for calling for demonstrations.
""Gathering and marching in protest are fundamental rights. But calling to the streets over an ongoing legal investigation is illegal and unacceptable,"" justice minister Yilmaz Tunc wrote online.
A message posted on Imamoglu's X account on Thursday called on Turkey to ""stand against this evil as a nation"", and urged members of the judiciary and of Erdogan's party to fight injustice.
""These events have gone beyond our parties, political ideals. The process is now concerning our people, namely your families,"" Imamoglu said. ""It is time to raise our voices.""
However, numbers of protesters are still relatively small for a city with more than 16 million people. For now, they are unlikely to raise political pressure on Erdogan to release Imamoglu.
Authorities must either release or charge Imamoglu by Sunday at the latest.
The arrests of Imamoglu and others follow a major nationwide crackdown in recent months, targeting opposition politicians, journalists and figures in the entertainment industry.
Some fear more will be brought in for questioning over the coming weeks as part of a campaign of intimidation.
Opposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the justice ministry on Wednesday criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests, and insisted on their judicial independence.
Imamoglu won a second term as Istanbul's mayor last year, when his CHP party swept local elections there and in Ankara.
It was the first time since Erdogan came to power that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.
The elections were also a personal blow to the president, who grew up in and became mayor of Istanbul on his rise to power.
Erdogan has held office for the past 22 years, as both prime minister and president of Turkey. Due to term limits, he cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.
The CHP's presidential candidate selection, in which 1.5 million members will vote and Imamoglu is the only person running, is set to take place on Sunday.
The party has also called on citizens to vote in a symbolic election, with plans to place ballot boxes in districts all over Turkey for people to show their support for the detained mayor.",Europe

BBC News","Russian President Vladimir Putin would breach a peace deal with Ukraine if it is not defended, Sir Keir Starmer has said, after attending a meeting of senior military leaders in London.
The UK prime minister said any agreement to stop the fighting between Russia and Ukraine would ""only be lasting"" if there were ""security arrangements in place"".
He was speaking at Permanent Joint Headquarters in Northwood, London, where more than 20 countries gathered at a closed meeting to discuss proposals for troops in Ukraine to help guarantee the country's security as part of any peace deal.
Sir Keir said security arrangements would make clear to Russia there would be ""severe consequences if they are to breach any deal"".
The prime minister said the UK and its allies were moving from ""political momentum"" to ""military planning"", which he said had ""to be done now"" before a deal was agreed.
He said: ""It is vitally important we do that work because we know one thing for certain, which is a deal without anything behind it is something that Putin will breach.
""We know that because it happened before. I'm absolutely clear in my mind it will happen again"".
Sir Keir ruled out redeploying UK troops from countries such as Estonia to commit to Kyiv, saying: ""There's no pulling back from our commitments to other countries.""
UK Defence Secretary John Healey was at the closed meeting of military leaders from countries that form part of what Sir Keir has dubbed the ""coalition of the willing"".
Downing Street said the military leaders would be involved in ""granular planning"" for details of any potential deployment.
The UK called the meeting of military chiefs after a summit earlier this month attended by 26 countries.
The potential deployment of troops should be described as a ""reassurance force"" rather than a ""peacekeeping force"", defence and diplomatic sources say.
Earlier, Sir Keir visited the Port of Barrow, in Cumbria, north-west England where the UK's nuclear submarines are built.
He told reporters the talks in London were focussing on how to ""keep the skies, and the seas, and the borders safe in Ukraine"".
According to the Daily Telegraph, sending British Typhoon jets to Ukraine to provide air cover for troops was one of the proposals discussed during the meeting.
Ahead of the talks, Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard said ""we're not yet talking about numbers"" of UK troops potentially being sent to Ukraine ""because we're still designing the shape of the force"".
Giving an example, he said: ""If one nation offers fast jet combat air, like a Typhoon aircraft for instance, how will the other nations work alongside it? Where will it refuel? How will it operate with other nations' capabilities?""
The armed forces minister said he expected discussions would be to ensure ""any force in or around Ukraine can be as credible as possible"".
During a visit to Norway on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia ""must stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war"".
Calls between US President Donald Trump, Putin and Zelensky, have failed to produce the 30-day ceasefire envisaged by the White House.
On Thursday Zelensky said Ukrainian officials would meet their US counterparts in Saudi Arabia next Monday, after the Kremlin confirmed US-Russia talks there the same day.
The latest talks come as the US attempts to broker a ceasefire between the two nations after more than three years of fighting.
Both Zelensky and Putin have agreed to a ceasefire in principle during conversations with the US - but one has yet to materialise due to conflicting conditions.",Europe

BBC News","Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukrainian and US officials will meet for peace talks in Saudi Arabia next Monday, after the Kremlin confirmed US-Russia talks there the same day.
Ukraine's leader said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""must stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war"". Moscow's demands include a complete end to military assistance for Ukraine.
Zelensky also warned that taking Nato membership for Ukraine off the table - something Putin has said was non-negotiable for peace - would be a ""big gift to Russia"".
He also rebuffed claims by the White House that he discussed ceding ownership of Ukraine's nuclear power plants to the US during a call with President Donald Trump.
The latest talks come as the US attempts to broker a ceasefire between the two nations after more than three years of fighting.
Both Zelensky and Putin have agreed to a ceasefire in principle during conversations with the US - but one has yet to materialise due to conflicting conditions.
The Russian leader most recently agreed to a halt to air strikes on energy infrastructure - but such strikes from both sides have continued.
Zelensky said a Ukrainian delegation would hand the US a list of infrastructure facilities it wants to be protected from Russian strikes at Monday's talks.
Asked about the White House touting the possible US ownership of Ukraine's nuclear power plants at a joint news conference with Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre in Oslo, Zelensky ruled this out entirely.
He said that the two had discussed the Zaporizhia power plant - which is currently under Russian control - in his phone call with Trump, but stressed that ""all nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine"".
However, he said he was open to the US taking the plant from Russia to invest in or modernise.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had earlier said that US ownership ""would be the best protection for that infrastructure"".
Asked if he was ready to make territorial concessions to Russia, particularly Crimea, which has been in Russian hands since 2014, Zelensky said: ""That is a Ukrainian peninsula,"" adding that Crimea was an ""integral part"" of his country.
Crimea is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, despite Russia's occupation and claimed annexation.
When asked what a ceasefire might look like, Zelensky said the first stage would have to be a ceasefire by land and sea, as Ukraine sees this as the only way to stop Russian aggression.
Trump was able to extract an agreement for a ceasefire on energy infrastructure - which Russia has repeatedly targeted - from Putin in a call on Tuesday, but nothing more.
Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said earlier this week that Moscow will seek guarantees that Nato would exclude Ukraine from membership and that Ukraine would remain neutral in any peace deal.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining the military alliance, saying it was ""not a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement"".
In the meantime, the war - which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 - continues. Strikes overnight killed two people in Ukraine, while Ukrainian drone attacks injured 10 and set an airfield on fire in Russia.
Speaking to EU leaders via video link at a meeting in Brussels, Zelensky reiterated calls for military aid to continue, asking European leaders for at least €5bn (£4.18bn) for artillery shells ""as soon as possible"", and said that continued support for Ukraine was ""crucial"".
He also said the EU must be involved in peace talks, and urged Europe not to ""ease pressure on Russia over the war"".
After Trump and Zelensky engaged in a public shouting match in the Oval Office over the war, the White House announced a pause to military aid for Ukraine.
The pause from Ukraine's main military backer was lifted a few days later after talks between the US and Ukraine, which also saw the backing of the proposed 30-day ceasefire.
Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that any peace deal would ""only be lasting"" if there were ""security arrangements in place"", after proposing a ""coalition of the willing"" to enforce peace in Ukraine following a deal.
His comments came during a visit to a military base in London, after holding a closed-door meeting with senior military officers of more than 20 countries involved in plans for the coalition.
Sir Keir said the UK and its allies were moving from ""political momentum"" to ""military planning"", which he said had ""to be done now"" before a deal was agreed.
He said: ""It is vitally important we do that work because we know one thing for certain, which is a deal without anything behind it is something that Putin will breach.

Royal correspondent
Reporting fromTallinn, Estonia","The Prince of Wales has praised the ""resilience"" of Ukrainians during his visit to Estonia, a trip taken to show support for UK troops guarding Nato's border with Russia.
On Thursday he met with young Ukrainian refugees at a school in the Estonian capital Tallinn.
""The Ukrainian resilience is everywhere,"" Prince William told the students. ""You have a very good spirit, very good souls, it's very important.""
The prince's two-day visit to the Baltic state began on Thursday with a 35-minute meeting with Estonian President Alar Karis during which they discussed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
Prince William received a very warm welcome from crowds waiting in the cold to see him, with the prince taking onlookers' camera phones to take selfies.
There has been talk about the royals sending signals about Canada - and on this walkabout the prince was wearing a jacket from Canadian company, Lululemon.
The royal visit comes amid uncertainty over the war in Ukraine and worries about Russia's next steps.
On Friday he is due to observe soldiers training in the Baltic state, as part of a multinational force aimed at deterring Russian aggression on Nato's eastern flank.
The 900 UK troops in Estonia include soldiers from the Mercian Regiment, of which Prince William is colonel-in-chief. This is currently the British Army's biggest operational deployment overseas.
As a sign of rising tensions, earlier this week Estonia was one of the countries on Russia's borders to withdraw from a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines - a sign of rising tensions.
Estonia's navy has been trying to prevent sabotage of undersea cables and the country is planning to increase military spending to 5% of its gross domestic product (GDP).
Prince William's visit to this small, high-tech country - described as a ""mini-Sweden"" by diplomatic sources - is another moment of royal soft power, sending a message about the UK's commitment to defending the Baltic states.
It follows a visit a few months ago by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.
Talking to students and staff at the University of Tallinn, the royal visit seems to have been warmly welcomed.
It is seen as a sign of support from Western allies for a country, with a population of only 1.3 million, keenly aware of its need for military assistance.
The threat from Russia seems very real from their perspective.
""We're more or less preparing for war,"" says Catlyn Kirna, a senior lecturer specialising in cyber-security.
There is already a constant wave of cyber attacks and misinformation from Russia, which will keep ""testing the water"" to see how Nato responds.
And as a former part of the Soviet empire, Estonia looks at the current situation in Ukraine with growing concern. The capital Tallinn has many Ukrainian flags flying alongside the Estonian.
""If Ukraine falls, we will have to fight for our lives,"" Catlyn says.
And with an 18-year-old son, it feels like a very personal worry.
The view from Eastern Europe, on Nato's front line, gives a much sharper perspective on issues around Russian expansionism, Catlyn says.
""In western Europe, it might be bad news,"" she says.
""For us, it's the end of the world.""
Political science student Julija Raudkivi says: ""[US] President Trump's comments and behaviour created anxiety for many Estonians.
""We talk about it a lot,"" she says, concerned by Trump's apparent lack of enthusiasm for the Nato alliance.
""There's definitely some underlying anxiety about the threat posed by Russia.
""It's the proximity, we're so close.""
Julija backs the push for more spending on arms and the strengthening of Nato forces.
Since Russia's attack on Ukraine, she says: ""It makes you feel like war is just behind the door.""
Liberal-arts student Sharon Kaasik says young people have grown up hearing stories about the Soviet regime before Estonia's independence in 1991 and there are worries about the past returning.
But she trusts in the military alliances and wants European countries to work more closely together.
Arts and music student Sander Poldmaa, 21, wants to defend his country and volunteers in Estonia's defence forces.
""We're a small country and Russia is right beside us,"" he says.
And he is unsettled by Trump's behaviour.
Sander wants Nato to be stronger but says it is about deterrence.
""The main point for me is that I don't want the war to happen,"" he says.
""But we need the ability to defend ourselves.
""The horror of people in the front line in Ukraine, I wouldn't want that for anyone.""
Estonia has given more aid to Ukraine, as a proportion of GDP, than any other country, four times as much in relative terms as the UK.

BBC News","The world's oldest Michelin-starred restaurant, Georges Blanc, has lost its third star, according to French media reports.
Georges Blanc, the 82-year-old French chef in charge of the restaurant in south-east France, told the AFP news agency that they ""weren't expecting it"".
""We'll make do with the two stars... maybe we'll be less elitist and a little more accessible.""
Based in the town of Vonnas outside the city of Lyon, the restaurant earned its first star back in 1929 under Georges' grandmother, Élisa Blanc, and has held at least one star from the coveted restaurant rating guide ever since.
Georges took over the restaurant in 1964 along with his mother, Paulette, before taking full control four years later at the age of just 25.
He won a third Michelin star for the establishment in 1981, and has held all three ever since - until now.
It means the octogenarian chef - who has won a slew of national awards, including France's Legion of Honour - has lived more of his life with three Michelin stars than without.
Gwendal Poullenec, director of the Michelin Guide, told AFP that they were trying to ""reflect the evolution of the quality of the restaurant in our rankings"".
But he also heaped praise on Mr Blanc. ""It was truly under his leadership that what was once a family inn experienced a new boom to become this gourmet village which is a true gastronomic destination today,"" he said.
The guide, he added, will ""continue to follow this restaurant with the same kindness, the same rigour"" in the years ahead.
Alongside his eponymous establishment, Mr Blanc owns several other restaurants, hotels and food shops, as well as an inn.
Michelin, a French tyre manufacturer, has made a restaurant guide since 1900, with the star system introduced in 1926.
They initially wrote one as a means to encourage driving, and so demand for car tyres.

BBC News","US President Donald Trump has held what he described as a ""very good"" hour-long phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, a day after speaking to Russia's President Vladimir Putin.
Zelensky said afterwards that he believed that ""lasting peace can be achieved this year"" under Trump's leadership.
Possible US ownership of Ukraine's nuclear power plants was also discussed, the White House said, though this has been ruled out by Zelensky.
The tone of the call seems to be in contrast to Zelensky's visit to the White House last month, in which the two leaders - along with US Vice-President JD Vance - were involved in a tense exchange.
Wednesday marked the first time the two men have spoken since that Oval Office meeting - although since then, their teams have met in Saudi Arabia and negotiated a proposed 30-day ceasefire.
While it is backed by Ukraine and the US, Putin rejected the proposal for a widespread pause in the conflict during his phone call with the US president on Tuesday.
In his conversation with Trump, Zelensky said he was open to a partial ceasefire involving a halt on strikes on energy infrastructure, rail and port facilities that could be established quickly - but the Ukrainian president warned his country would retaliate if Moscow violated the terms of the ceasefire.
""I understand that until we agree [with Russia], until there is a corresponding document on even a partial ceasefire, I think that everything will fly,"" he said, referring to drones and missiles.
While both Zelensky and Putin have said they would agree to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, both have since accused each other of continued attacks.
Writing on his Truth social platform, Trump said the call was aimed at aligning Ukraine and Russia ""in terms of their requests and needs"", adding that ceasefire efforts were on track.
Later, in a more detailed statement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump had agreed to help Ukraine source additional air defence systems, particularly in Europe.
The two leaders ""agreed to share information closely between their defence staffs as the battlefield situation evolved"", he said.
Rubio's statement also said Trump and Zelensky had discussed ""Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants"" with Trump saying the US ""could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise"".
""American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,"" Rubio's statement added.
But when asked about the suggestion at a news conference in Norway on Thursday, Zelensky said: ""All nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine. These are state-owned nuclear power plants.""
Zelensky said that he and Trump had discussed the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, located in Russian-held territory, but that he had told the US president: ""If it does not belong to Ukraine, it will not work for anybody.""
He added that he ""definitely did not discuss"" a change of ownership, but had told Trump he was ""open to discuss"" the US taking the Zaporizhzhia plant from Russia to invest in and modernise.
The latest developments will come as a relief for Zelensky, who described his conversation with Trump as ""positive"", ""frank"" and ""very substantive"" during an online briefing to journalists on Wednesday.
Zelensky also said he believed Putin would not agree to a full ceasefire while Ukrainian troops remained in Russia's western Kursk region, on which Kyiv launched a surprise attack last August.
Trump, meanwhile, said: ""Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.""
Teams from Ukraine and the US are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days.
In the White House last month, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support, and that he was ""gambling with World War Three"".
The US temporarily then suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, but diplomats were able to improve relations and on 11 March the two sides agreed on a ceasefire.
During his call with Trump on Tuesday, Putin agreed to halt Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
But he said a full ceasefire would only work if Ukraine's supporters stopped giving military assistance - a condition Kyiv's European allies have previously rejected.
Hours later both Ukraine and Russia launched attacks, with Kyiv saying hospitals had been targeted.
Officials in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said that a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a small fire at an oil depot.
Despite the strikes, Kyiv and Moscow carried out an exchange of prisoners on Wednesday. Each side released 175 POWs.
Zelensky described the swap as ""one of the largest"", adding that Russia included an extra 22 ""severely wounded"" soldiers.",Europe

Reporting fromLondon","Thousands have gathered at cemeteries across North Macedonia for the funerals of dozens of people killed in a nightclub fire on Sunday.
The blaze tore through the small Pulse club in the town of Kocani, killing 59 and injuring scores more.
Officials say the club illegally obtained its licence, that it lacked sprinklers, and that the venue was a converted carpet warehouse, whose single emergency exit was locked at the time of the fire.
More than 20 people have been detained, including government officials, police officers and the manager of the club, as anger has grown.
Funerals took place across the country on Thursday for the dead.
The funeral procession in Kocani was long - and understandably sombre. This small town of fewer than 30,000 people lost dozens of its young people.
Many mourners held portrait photographs of the people they had lost. Some teenagers tried to hide their tears behind sunglasses, but others wept openly.
The dead were buried side-by-side in Kocani's cemetery. An Orthodox Church service was to follow.
In Skopje, around 1,000 people gathered for the funeral of Andrej Gorgieski, a 43-year-old singer in the band DNK that was performing at the club when the fire broke out.
While the day is for mourning, anger is growing over corrupt practices that allowed the Pulse nightclub to operate.
Protests against corruption have taken place across the country this week.
On Monday, some in Kocani even vandalised a pub which they said the Pulse nightclub owner had also run. Others threw rocks and smashed windows at the mayor's office the same night.
The anger and the grief have prompted government inspections of cafes and nightclubs across North Macedonia for any possible safety violations.
Investigators have now named all 59 people killed in the blaze - most of them teenagers and young people.
The deadly fire began around 02:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Sunday and spread rapidly as the ceiling was made of flammable material, Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said earlier this week.
He said there were 500 people inside the venue at the time, well over capacity for the 250 tickets sold, and that there were ""grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption"" linked to the fire.
More than 160 people were injured in the blaze, including 45 suffering very serious injuries. Many were flown to hospitals in neighbouring Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey for specialist treatment.",Europe

BBC News NI Dublin reporter","Gardaí (Irish police) have rejected a claim by mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Conor McGregor that the Republic of Ireland's capital city is ""dangerous"".
After meeting the US President Donald Trump in the White House on St Patrick's Day, McGregor claimed Dublin's city centre had ""gone from one of the safest cities in Europe to one of the most dangerous"" in 10 years.
Responding to the claim, gardaí said they do not comment on ""uninformed"" third party remarks.
But a spokesperson said: ""It is, however, a statement of fact that according to the Global Peace Index, Ireland is ranked second only to Iceland.""
""Furthermore, Ireland ranks as the thirteenth most safe country in the world under the specific category of 'Societal Safety and Security',"" a gardaí spokesperson added.
Earlier this week, Irish government leaders denounced McGregor following his White House visit on St Patrick's Day.
Speaking in The White House press briefing room, McGregor accused the Irish government of ""abandoning"" the voices of the people of Ireland as he criticised immigration policies.
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin criticised the fighter's comments on social media, saying: ""Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland.""
The Tánaiste (Irish deputy PM) and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Harris, said there was a real sense of ""disgust"" in Ireland about the visit.
Harris said the fighter does ""not speak for Ireland"".
Last year, an Irish woman who accused the MMA fighter of raping her in a Dublin hotel won a civil court action against him.
A jury at the High Court in Dublin found that McGregor had assaulted Nikita Hand and ordered him to pay her more than €248,000 (£206,000) in damages.
McGregor has lodged an appeal.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0zrg9kpno,Hungary bans LGBTQ+ Pride marches,2025-03-19T16:43:21.890Z,"Toby Luckhurst
BBC News","Hungary has passed a law banning Pride marches held by the LGBTQ+ community, sparking outrage in and out of the country.
Parliament voted for the measure just a day after the bill was submitted on Monday, in a process fast-tracked by the ruling right-wing Fidesz party under Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Orban praised the legislation, which bans the event on alleged grounds it is harmful to children, saying: ""We won't let woke ideology endanger our kids.""
Pride marches had been held for the past 30 years in Hungary. Opposition lawmakers lit flares during the voting session on Tuesday, while demonstrators blocked a bridge in central Budapest. Human rights groups have also condemned the move.
It is the latest measure from Orban's government targeting Hungary's LGBTQ+ community.
In 2020, the country abolished its legal recognition of transgender people, and in 2021, politicians passed a law banning the depiction of homosexuality to under-18s.
Under the terms of the new law, it is now ""forbidden to hold an assembly in violation"" of that 2021 legislation.
Anyone who does faces fines of up to 500 euros ($545; £420). That could include attendees and march organisers. Police are also allowed to use facial recognition technology to identify possible offenders.
MPs also amended Hungary's right of assembly in parliament on Tuesday.
The law now says that only events ""respecting the right of children to proper physical, mental and moral development"" may take place.
Opponents of Hungary's Pride marches, and of the country's LGBTQ+ community in general, have regularly, and without evidence, accused such demonstrations of being dangerous for minors.
Protesters outside the parliament on Tuesday chanted:""Assembly is a fundamental right"". They blocked off central Budapest's Margaret Bridge while staring down a police cordon.
The EU's equality commissioner Hadja Lahbib condemned the move. ""Everyone should be able to be who they are, live & love freely,"" she wrote on X.
""The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community - in Hungary & in all Member States.""
The organisers of Budapest Pride criticised the decision on social media. ""This is not child protection, this is fascism,"" they wrote.
""A democratic leader would never think of restricting the fundamental rights of those who disagree with him.""
Organisers vowed to continue to hold their planned 30th Pride march in Budapest on 28 June.
In recent months Orban has launched increasing attacks on his critics and announced plans for more conservative law changes, vowing last year to ""occupy Brussels"" to protect Hungary's freedom.
His Fidesz party has been in office since 2010. But polls suggest that the new centre-right party Tisza is in the lead nationally ahead of next year's parliamentary election.
Tisza, which wants a more constructive relationship with the EU, shot up in popularity after Peter Magyar, a one-time Fidesz politician, broke with the ruling party in February 2024 over what he said was its poor running of Hungary.",Europe

BBC News","Russia and Ukraine have launched air attacks that damaged each other's infrastructure, hours after Vladimir Putin said Russia would stop targeting Ukrainian energy sites.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's targets included hospitals. He said the Russian leader had in effect rejected a comprehensive ceasefire in his call on Tuesday with US President Donald Trump.
Putin told Trump a full ceasefire would only work if Ukraine's allies stopped giving military assistance - a condition Ukraine's European allies have previously rejected.
Officials in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said that a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a small fire at an oil depot.
Within hours of Putin agreeing to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, Zelensky said there had been ""hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure"", including a hospital in Sumy.
The region's government posted footage of the destruction, in which smoke can be seen rising from the caved-in hospital wing. Officials have since said that there had been no casualties.
Zelensky said that Russia launched more than 40 drones against Ukraine in the hours following the call between Trump and Putin.
""It is these types of night-time attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians,"" Zelensky said.
""Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire.""
The Ukrainian president also confirmed that a call would take place between him and Trump on Wednesday, but gave no further details.
Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said of the 57 Ukrainian drones it intercepted and destroyed overnight, 35 were over the Kursk border region.
In Belgorod, a Russian region on the border with Ukraine, the governor said the situation ""remains difficult"". Moscow said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces attempted a ground assault on Belgorod but were pushed back.
The two countries also carried out their latest prisoner exchange on Wednesday, involving the release of 175 prisoners of war each. Zelensky said an additional 22 ""severely wounded"" Ukrainian soldiers were also freed.
Putin rejected an immediate and full ceasefire in Ukraine, agreeing only to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, following a much-anticipated call with Trump.
The Russian leader declined to sign up to the comprehensive month-long ceasefire that Trump's team recently worked out with Ukrainians in Saudi Arabia.
But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia and the US will agree either today or on Thursday the dates and attendees of their next meeting.
US talks on Ukraine are due to continue on Sunday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said.
About 80% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian bombs, Zelensky said last September.
Kyiv has in turn conducted drone and missile strikes deep into Russian territory, on oil and gas facilities.",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjevg23enggo,Rosenberg: Trump-Putin call seen as victory in Russia,2025-03-19T12:54:16.154Z,"Steve Rosenberg
Russia editor","Judging by some of the headlines today in Russia, Moscow believes that the latest telephone conversation between Presidents Putin and Trump went well - certainly for the Kremlin.
""Putin and Trump agreed to work together on Ukraine resolution,"" concludes Izvestia.
""Record-long Putin-Trump call,"" declares Komsomolskaya Pravda. The paper's website adds: ""As things stand Russia has scored a diplomatic victory here.""
Why are some in Russia claiming ""victory"" after this two-hour phone call?
Probably because, by the end of it, Vladimir Putin hadn't been pressured into making any major concessions to Ukraine or to the United States. On the contrary, he had - in effect - rejected President Trump's idea of an immediate unconditional 30-day ceasefire.
Instead of pressuring Moscow with the threat of even tougher sanctions and penalties, to get Russia to sign up to its plan, the US administration reacted by praising the Kremlin leader.
""We had a great call,"" Donald Trump told Fox News.
""I would commend President Putin for all he did today on that call to move his country close to a final peace deal,"" said Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff.
Not only did Moscow not agree to an unconditional ceasefire, President Putin set his own pre-conditions for peace.
They include an end to Western military aid to Kyiv and intelligence sharing with the Ukrainians, as well as a halt to mobilisation in Ukraine. Such conditions are widely viewed as a way of securing Ukraine's capitulation.
It's hard to see Kyiv agreeing to any of that.
But could the Trump administration eventually be persuaded, by Moscow, that such conditions are acceptable? And if so, would Washington force Ukraine to accept them?
Much may depend on whether the Kremlin can convince President Trump he has more to gain from developing good ties with Moscow than by defending Ukraine's corner.
As if to press home the point, in their conversations with the Americans, Russian officials are already dangling various economic and financial carrots and talking about how mutually beneficial the Russia-US relationship could be if the two countries can re-energise bilateral relations and get to work on joint projects.
Vladimir Putin recently raised the prospect of US-Russian cooperation in aluminium production and rare minerals mining.
The message appears to be getting through.
""We'd like to have more trade with Russia,"" said Donald Trump on Tuesday in his interview with Fox News.
""They have some very valuable things for us, including rare earth. They have a big chunk of real estate, the biggest in the world. They have things that we could use.""
Moscow may well be hoping - possibly calculating - that Donald Trump will prioritise getting a chunk of that ""Russian real estate"" over securing an acceptable deal for Ukraine to end the war.
It's a point echoed today by the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper:
""Moscow's logic is to make economic relations with America so profitable that severing them would be too costly for the United States.""
After Ukraine had agreed to an unconditional ceasefire a week ago, the US administration publicly announced that ""the ball is in [Russia's] court"".
Now that Vladimir Putin has rejected the deal and set his own conditions, the Kremlin leader has hit it back into America's ""court"".
But Russia and America will continue their discussions - both on Ukraine and on US-Russian ties.
And it's these negotiations which are likely to influence Donald Trump's next move.",Europe

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzp3gn370o,Former Putin-appointed governor on trial for breaching UK sanctions,2025-03-18T18:35:30.513Z,"Daniel Sandford
UK correspondent","A man who President Vladimir Putin appointed as the Governor of Sevastopol after Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia has gone on trial accused of breaching UK financial sanctions against him.
Dmitrii Ovsiannikov is accused of receiving more than £75,000 from his wife Ekaterina Ovsiannikova and a new Mercedes Benz SUV from his brother Alexei Owsjanikow.
Between them, the three defendants at Southwark Crown Court face 10 charges of breaching the sanctions, and two charges of money laundering. They deny all the charges.
Dmitrii held a senior position in Crimea for three years and the court heard he was also Russia's Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade.
Two years after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, President Vladimir Putin appointed Dmitrii Ovsiannikov as acting governor of the ""strategically significant"" city of Sevastopol in Crimea, the jury were told.
In 2017, elections were held there for the position of governor and Mr Ovsiannikov won.
Paul Jarvis, for the prosecution, said he ""was an important political figure within the Russian Federation"" though Dmitrii Ovsiannikov later resigned from the position in July 2019.
As a result of his senior job in illegally annexed Crimea, the EU imposed financial sanctions on Mr Ovsiannikov saying that among other things he had ""called for Sevastopol to become the southern capital of the Russian Federation.""
When the UK left the EU, the UK imposed financial sanctions on him too. He later challenged the EU sanctions and had them lifted, but the UK sanctions still apply.
They are called the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. The regulations make it a criminal offence to try to get round the sanctions.
The trial is the first criminal case involving the breach of the Russia Regulations.
In August 2022, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov travelled to Turkey from Russia and applied for a British passport.
Despite the fact that the UK sanctions still applied, the jury heard that he was granted a passport in January 2023, which he was entitled to because his father was born in the UK.
Mr Jarvis said: ""The father of Dmitrii and Alexei had been born in Bradford, United Kingdom, in 1950. Their mother was Russian. Dmitrii and Alexei hold British passports by virtue of their father being a British citizen.""
Dmitrii Ovsiannikov then arrived in Britain on 1 February 2023, moving into his brother's house in Clapham, where his wife and two younger children were already living and attending private school.
On 6 February, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov applied for a Halifax bank account, saying on the form that he was single, but also saying that he was living in Clapham with his wife.
Over the next two and a half weeks Ekaterina Ovsiannikova transferred £76,000 into her husband's account allowing him to put down a deposit on a Mercedes Benz GLC 300 SUV.
However, the bank later realised he was on the UK sanctions list and froze the account.
After this, he went back to the dealership and recovered his deposit. His brother Alexei Owsjanikow bought the car instead, paying more than £54,000 the prosecution said.
The prosecution say that when Mr Ovsiannikov's wife sent him the £76,000 and his brother bought the car they were in breach of the Russia Regulations.
Mr Jarvis told the jury that ""they maintain that they either did not know that Dmitrii was a designated person or they did not realise that as a designated person he was not permitted to receive that type of help"".
He also added that Dmitrii Ovsiannikov must have known he was subject to UK sanctions, because on 7 February 2023 he was applying for them to be lifted and had included his unique ID number and group ID number from his sanctions listing on the form.
Speaking to the jury, Mr Jarvis said that this showed that Mr Ovsiannikov was aware of the sanctions ""and he must have made his nearest and dearest aware of that too"".
In January 2024 all three defendants were arrested and interviewed by police.
Four months later, Alexei Owsjanikow paid more than £40,000 in school fees for his brother's two youngest children who were at the Royal Russell School in Croydon - also a breach of the sanctions.
Paul Jarvis told the jury that in a police interview Alexei accepted that he had paid the school fees, but he maintained that the payments did not amount to a breach of the Russian Regulations because he believed that Ekaterina was solely responsible for those fees and not Dmitrii.
The trial is expected to continue at Southwark Crown Court for three weeks.",Europe

Security correspondent
Reporting fromBerlin
Toby Luckhurst
BBC News
Reporting fromLondon","German lawmakers have voted to allow a huge increase in defence and infrastructure spending - a seismic shift for the country that could reshape European defence.
A two-thirds majority of Bundestag parliamentarians, required for the change, approved the vote on Tuesday.
The law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules, and create a €500bn ($547bn; £420bn) infrastructure fund.
This vote is a historic move for traditionally debt-shy Germany, and could be hugely significant for Europe, as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on, and after US President Donald Trump signalled an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.
However, state government representatives in the upper house, the Bundesrat, still need to approve the moves - also by a two-thirds majority - before they officially become law. That vote is set for Friday.
Friedrich Merz, the man behind these plans and who is expected to soon be confirmed as Germany's new chancellor, told the lower house during Tuesday's debate that the country had ""felt a false sense of security"" for the past decade.
""The decision we are taking today... can be nothing less than the first major step towards a new European defence community,"" he said, adding that it includes countries that are ""not members of the European Union"".
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the vote ""excellent news"".
Speaking at a press conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, she said the vote ""sends a very clear message to Europe that Germany is determined to invest massively in defence"".
Frederiksen meanwhile called it ""fantastic news for all Europeans"".
Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.
But despite fears the vote would be tight, lawmakers in the end voted in favour of the changes by 513 to 207 - comfortably over the two-thirds majority required.
One leading German newspaper described this vote as ""A day of destiny for our nation"".
Under the measure, any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now, this debt brake has been fixed at 0.35% of GDP.
The change could transform the country's partially neglected armed forces in an era of great uncertainty for Europe.
And this vote was not just about defence. It was also about freeing up €500bn for German infrastructure - fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.
Merz, whose CDU party won Germany's general election last month, proposed the measures swiftly after the win.
In an interview on Sunday he specifically mentioned fears that the US could pull back from defending Europe and Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that the ""situation has worsened in recent weeks"".
""That is why we have to act fast,"" Merz told public broadcaster ARD.
It is a significant political win for Merz, who will, when he takes power as chancellor, now have access to hundreds of billions of euros to invest in the state - what some in Germany have called a ""fiscal bazooka"".
It is also an important moment for Ukraine. The defence plans approved today by the Bundestag also allow spending on aid for states ""attacked in violation of international law"" to be exempt from the debt brake.
That will enable outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz to release €3bn in aid to Ukraine as early as next week.
Merz chose to push the changes through the old parliament, knowing the vote arithmetic was more favourable now than it would be after 25 March, when the new parliament session begins.
The far-right AFD and far-left Linke, which both performed well in February's election, oppose Merz's plans.
Merz has still not agreed a coalition deal to govern Germany after his election win, and has announced ambitious plans to have a government in place by Easter.
Coalition negotiations in Germany, however, can drag on for months at a time.",Europe

Tilly Cripwell pointed out that the bronze artwork has been groped so many times over the years that its breasts have become discoloured.
The 23-year-old student said she has witnessed ""disgusting behaviour"" at the statue many times while busking beside it in recent years.
Dublin City Council has said it is considering the campaigner's call to repair the discoloured statue and raise it on to a higher plinth.
The council also confirmed it is in the process of asking tourist companies to deter their customers from touching the statue.
Ms Cripwell said the groping of the sculpture's breasts by passers by and some tourists ""sets a really bad example to younger generations"".
""It triggered me so much, I just had to put a stop to it,"" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.
""The fact that this icon is immortalised in a statue but reduced to her breasts just seems so wrong.""
The Molly Malone statue was erected 37 years ago in tribute to a legendary Dublin woman who sold shellfish in the streets of the Irish capital.
It is not clear if the character is based on a real or fictional person, but the figure of Molly Malone has come to represent part of Dublin's working class community.
She was also the subject of a traditional folk song, which tells the story of a fishmongers' daughter who sold cockles and mussels from a wheelbarrow.
According to the colourful lyrics, Molly died of a fever but then returned as a ghost, still wheeling her wheelbarrow through the city's streets.
Many public artworks in Dublin are popularly referred to by rhyming nicknames and for years, the Molly Malone statue was known as ""the tart with the cart"".
This name was in part due to suggestions that Molly Malone worked as a fishmonger by day and as a sex worker by night.
The statue was first erected in Dublin's Grafton Street in 1988, created by the renowned bronze sculptor, Jeanne Rynhart.
It was later moved to nearby St Andrews' Street to accommodate the construction of a tram line.
Ms Cripwell, who studies at Trinity College in Dublin, accepts that many people think they are doing nothing wrong because ""it's just a statue"".
But she said the groping annoys her because the sculpture is ""one of the few representations of women in Irish culture"".
""You can imagine the stag dos that come along and it's actually just disgusting behaviour, no matter what kind of object or person you're dealing with.""
The statue is already on a small plinth but Ms Cripwell wants it raised higher to encourage respect and to prevent people clamouring over the statue so easily.
She points out that the statues of male figures in Dublin ""are all on high platforms reflecting their status"".
The campaigner acknowledged that she is asking for alterations to be made to an artwork that has become a Dublin landmark, but she argued change is necessary.
""She already been violated and that's shown in the gold discoloration on her breasts, so the original statue is not the same as it was.""
Ms Cripwell is also lobbying for the whole sculpture to be repatinated ""so that her breasts aren't a different colour than the rest of her"".
Dublin City Council's spokeswoman told BBC News NI the request for ""repatination and securing the plinth is being considered"" and they are awaiting cost quotations.
""A full report will be made to the council's Strategic Policy Committee in April,"" she added.
An urban myth has emerged over the years which claims that touching the statue's breasts will somehow bring good luck.
It is a myth that has been perpetuated by some tourist companies - a practice that Ms Cripwell wants Dublin City Council to clamp down on.
One example of this was still visible on a Spain-based tourism website, Viabam, on Tuesday morning.
In a feature about the statue, the website read: ""They say that if you take a photo with her while touching her breasts, you will return to visit the city.
""And it seems to work, as it is one of the most sought-after and photographed monuments in Dublin.""
When contacted by BBC News NI, Viabam's spokesperson said the article was written a couple of years ago and it was ""never our intention to offend anyone"".
""We were totally unaware of this campaign and we have absolutely no problem in removing that information,"" they added.
Ms Cripwell said she wants tourist firms to ""actively deter"" their customers from touching the Molly Malone statue.
But several tourists - both male and female - were photographed by news agencies as they touched the statue during the St Patrick's Day festival on Monday.
The campaigner said the sculpture's ""allegedly busty dress"" was viewed as ""a green card for this behaviour"".
She added the practice is also popular at other European tourist sites, including at the statue of Shakespeare's Juliet in Verona.",Europe

Anthony Gallagher and his brother, who is also in his 60s, were hit by the car on Lower Main Street in Letterkenny, County Donegal, at about 03:00 local time on Monday.
The injured man is being treated for serious injuries in University Hospital Galway.
A teenage motorist who was arrested at the scene of the crash has been released without charge and a file sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
Letterkenny's St Patrick's Day parade was cancelled due to the crash and about 200 people attended a vigil in the town for the two brothers on Monday.
The Mayor of Letterkenny and Milford, Gerry McMonagle, said the incident had left a dark cloud over the local community.
""People turned out in large numbers to the vigil and people were visibly shocked,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme.
""There is just a real sense of disbelief that something like this has happened - there was a stunned silence at the vigil last night and it's just so hard to take in.""
McMonagle said Anthony Gallagher was a much-loved lollipop man at a local school.
""I am sure the children, as they head back to school today, will be sorely missing him and all of the teachers and friends around the town.""
Deli manager Maria Gough said she knew both Anthony Gallagher and his brother very well.
""Anthony was just a local guy who was well loved and well liked - just a lovely quiet man,"" Ms Gough said.
""He would come into us here for his breakfast each morning and we'd also do up his lunch for him and his brother, without fail every day.

BBC News","The Czech Republic is pushing for EU support to keep Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) running after the Trump administration cut funding for the global broadcaster.
Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said RFE/RL, based in Prague, ""is one of the few credible sources in dictatorships like Iran, Belarus, and Afghanistan"".
In Eastern Europe, the US government-funded outlet reached millions of listeners during the Cold War, helping to spread democratic values while communist authorities tightly controlled local media.
Elon Musk, in charge of cost-cutting under Donald Trump, dismissed RFE/RL as ""radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money"".
But RFE/RL's president and CEO Stephen Capus said axing the broadcaster's grant agreement ""would be a massive gift to America's enemies"".
""The Iranian Ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years,"" he added.
Mr Capus's concern was echoed by the independent Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which complained that thousands of journalists would be hit by the US funding cut - and that some working in censored countries were already ""in grave danger"".
RFE/RL says it reaches a weekly audience of nearly 50 million people in 23 countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Afghanistan and ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia and the Caucasus.
Czech foreign minister Mr Lipavsky told the BBC he was working on building a ""platform of countries"" to support the station, but added that they ""need to be very careful and mindful of the USA, which has this operation on their side"".
""We will try to do everything to keep this organization with 75 years of legacy afloat,"" he said.
RFE/RL, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America (VOA) have relied for decades on funding from the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM).
President Trump signed an executive order on Friday to cut their funding after Musk had scorned them on X, saying ""shut them down"".
The move contrasts with the media policies of authorities in Russia, China and Iran, who have poured funding into their state broadcasters to counter the impact of Western liberalism around the world.
Most of VOA's full-time staff have been put on administrative leave and the broadcaster's contractors, who dominate the non-English language services, have been laid off, the AFP news agency reports.",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjdpy8dyzzo,Government denies using 'sonic cannon' at Serbia protests,2025-03-18T13:06:08.663Z,"Milica Radenković Jeremić and Lara Owen
BBC World Service
Reporting fromBelgrade and London","For a few seconds, there was only pure panic, as chaos and fear surged through the crowd at a major anti-government protest in Serbia. What started as confusion has since spiralled into questions over whether an illegal sonic weapon was used to silence the demonstration.
A large crowd of protesters in Belgrade were observing a 15-minute silence on Saturday evening in honour of the 15 people killed when part of a railway station collapsed in Novi Sad in November.
Then, out of nowhere, a loud, jarring noise shattered the quiet.
The mood shifted in an instant. The crowd surged towards the pavement in panic. I was swept along with them. People scattered in all directions.
At first, many thought the noise was an emergency vehicle, after what had sounded like a car crash. But there were no sirens.
Then came the rumours. Claims emerged that a sonic weapon – a device capable of causing pain, dizziness, and hearing damage – had been deployed against the peaceful protesters.
Serbian officials have denied these reports, rejecting allegations that security forces deployed a military-grade Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) – also known as a ""sonic cannon"" – during the demonstration.
The Serbian army has stated that it neither possesses nor has ever used a sonic cannon.
In an interview with Serbia's state-owned broadcaster RTS, military Brigadier General Slavko Rakić said: ""A sonic cannon uses a sound system that is amplified well above the sound system of humans and other living things. What we saw is nothing like that.
""The effect that is achieved is an amplified sound recording and it should be audible, but that is not present in the recordings.""
The public prosecutor's office in Belgrade has instructed the Ministry of Internal Affairs to investigate the incident.
Between 275,000 and 325,000 people were estimated to have taken part in the protest. The government put the attendance at 107,000.
One of the places where protesters gathered was outside Belgrade's bright-yellow Student Cultural Centre in the heart of the Serbian capital.
For more than four months, students have blockaded their universities and organised protests, demanding that those responsible for the railway station collapse be brought to justice.
Eyewitnesses who spoke to BBC Serbian reported hearing the noise, but the intensity varied depending on where they stood in the crowd.
Some likened it to the roar of a Formula One race, while others said it sounded like an airplane flying low overhead, or even an MRI machine.
""It was like being on the starting line of a Grand Prix,"" said 43-year-old protester Ivan Vasic. ""I didn't feel anything afterwards, but my wife complained of a bad headache that lasted until late in the night.""
Other protesters described feeling vertigo-like sensations.
""It was a horrible sound. It was so powerful, and it felt like something was going to crash on to our heads,"" said 37-year-old Lela Sredojevic.
""I had never felt anything like that. I was really scared. It lasted less than a minute, but in that moment, it felt like eternity.""
The tool at the centre of these claims is called a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) – commonly known as a sonic weapon or sonic cannon.
LRADs can focus sound waves at high intensities, causing pain, nausea, and disorientation and their use is prohibited under Serbian police law.
""Sonic systems are a more recent development, emerging in the early 2000s,"" BBC Russian's defence correspondent Pavel Aksenov said.
""They can target either crowds or individuals, and have been used by police and military units in a number of countries to suppress riots, disperse demonstrations, guard checkpoints, or even protect ships from pirate attacks.""
He added that, although these weapons are classified as non-lethal, they can still cause harm to human health and their impact is hard to regulate.
Trevor Cox, professor of Acoustic Engineering at the University of Salford, told the BBC that a sound loud enough to cause the symptoms many reported should be more audible in the footage circulating on social media.
""If people are noticing either a ringing in the ear or a temporary threshold shift – like when you come out of a night club and you are slightly deaf – it indicates sound that is loud enough to cause temporary damage to your hearing,"" he said.
""That's quite serious because that can become permanent.""
However, Prof Cox also suggested the incident might not have involved a ""sonic weapon"".
""Even if the sound wasn't loud enough to cause hearing damage, it could still trigger a fight-or-flight response and a mass crowd reaction. Tinnitus can also be triggered by stress,"" he said.
Jürgen Altmann, a physicist who has studied acoustic weapons and their effects, told the BBC that the noise ""seems to have been produced by a strong acoustic source, maybe a device from the LRAD family"", but added that ""other mechanisms are possible"".
A group of six Serbian NGOs said in a joint statement: ""From 500 reports from citizens and their testimonies, it is clear that during the protest on 15 March, there was a strong sonic boom, which caused a series of physical and psychological reactions among those present.""
They added: ""According to testimonies, those present felt a strong sound impact, followed by a wave of heat or wind.""
Despite the chaos, there is little expectation that this movement will subside.
Large demonstrations are expected to resume as soon as this week, and smaller protests, like one involving around 500 students on Monday, are becoming routine.
A young female protester summed it up: ""Literally everyone I know went to the protest. Usually, people make excuses. Now everyone is on their way.""

BBC News","Donald Trump is due to speak on the phone to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to discuss a US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire deal.
The peace proposal on the table was discussed by Ukrainian and American delegates in Saudi Arabia last week.
After hours locked away in a room, they announced proposals for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine said it was ready to accept.
Now Russia and the US will discuss the deal, but what could the two leaders talk about?
Trump posted on Truth Social that he will speak to Putin on Tuesday morning.
The US president says ""many elements"" of a peace agreement in Ukraine have been agreed, but ""much remains"" to be worked upon.
""Each week brings 2,500 soldier deaths, from both sides, and it must end NOW. I look very much forward to the call with President Putin,"" Trump wrote.
He earlier told reporters that ""we're going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace, and I think we'll be able to do it"".
The White House also sounded a more upbeat note on Monday, saying peace in Ukraine had ""never been closer"".
However, there have been varying views from within the Trump administration of how advanced the ceasefire talks are.
Speaking after his meeting in Jeddah with Ukrainian officials on 11 March, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the ""bulk"" of the conversation had been ""what a negotiation process would look like"" and not ""the specific conditions"".
US envoy Steve Witkoff, who met Putin on Thursday in Moscow, has also struck a more measured tone.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on what the leaders would discuss, responding: ""We never do that"".
While Putin has previously said he supports a ceasefire, he also set out a list of conditions for achieving peace.
Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on 13 March, Putin said of the ceasefire proposal: ""The idea is right - and we support it - but there are questions that we need to discuss.""
Putin also outlined some of his questions over how a ceasefire would work. He asked: ""How will those 30 days be used? For Ukraine to mobilise? Rearm? Train people? Or none of that? Then a question - how will that be controlled?
""Who will give the order to end the fighting? At what cost? Who decides who has broken any possible ceasefire, over 2,000km? All those questions need meticulous work from both sides. Who polices it?""
Asked on Sunday what concessions were being considered in the ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: ""We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants [...] We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.""
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters on Monday that Trump was ""determined"" to secure the peace deal.
On what the talks might cover, she said: ""There's a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he will address it in his call with Putin tomorrow.""
The facility is likely to be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, and fears of a nuclear accident have persisted due to fighting in the area.
Another area of contention is Russia's western Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory.
Russia had pushed to recapture it in recent weeks, and Putin now claims it is fully back in control of Kursk.
He has also raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east and has said he would not accept Nato troops on the territory.
France's President Macron and newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who met on Tuesday, stressed their nations would continue their ""unwavering"" support of Ukraine and demand ""clear commitments"" from Russia.
In his nightly address on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Putin of prolonging the war.
""This proposal could have been implemented long ago,"" he said, adding that ""every day in wartime means human lives"".
Meanwhile, the UK and France have urged Putin to prove he wants a peace deal with Ukraine.
French President Emmanuel Macron hailed the ""courage"" of Zelensky in agreeing to a ceasefire proposal, and challenged Russia to do the same.
""Enough deaths. Enough lives destroyed. Enough destruction. The guns must fall silent,"" Macron said in a post on X.
UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin should agree to a ""full and unconditional ceasefire now"", telling MPs he had seen ""no sign"" that Putin was serious about a peace deal.
He warned that the UK and its allies had ""more cards that we can play"" to help force Russia to negotiate ""seriously"".",Europe

BBC News
Reporting fromLondon","Poland and the Baltic states have announced plans to withdraw from a key international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, citing the rising threat from Russia.
In a joint statement, the defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said that since signing the Ottawa Treaty, threats from Moscow and its ally Belarus have ""significantly increased"".
It is ""paramount"" to give their troops ""flexibility and freedom of choice"" to defend Nato's eastern flank, they said.
The Ottawa Treaty, also known as the Mine Ban Treaty, came into force in 1997. It aims to ban anti-personnel mines - those aimed at humans - worldwide, and has been signed by more than 160 countries.
But some major military powers - including China, India, Russia, Pakistan, and the US - never signed up to it.
All of the Baltic states had signed the convention by 2005, while Poland joined in 2012.
In their joint statement on Tuesday, the nations' defence ministers said, however, that the security situation in their region since signing the treaty had ""significantly deteriorated"".
""In light of these considerations, we... unanimously recommend withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention.
""With this decision, we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our territory and freedom,"" the defence ministers wrote.
But they stressed that despite plans to leave the treaty, Poland and the Baltic states are still committed to international humanitarian laws, ""including the protection of civilians during armed conflict"".
""Our nations will continue to uphold these principles while addressing our security needs,"" they wrote.
All four countries are in the Nato alliance, and all four share borders with Russia.
Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Baltic states and Poland have hugely increased military spending, and leant a great deal of support to Ukraine.
According to the Kiel Institute think tank, by percentage of GDP, the Baltic States and Poland are among the highest donors of aid to Ukraine.
Ukraine is a signatory to the Ottawa Treaty, although it has received land mines from the US during Russia's full-scale invasion, and in the past has told the UN that due to Russia's invasion it cannot guarantee it is abiding by the treaty.
Article 20 of the convention specifically states however that a nation cannot withdraw from the treaty if it is currently at war.
The UN estimates the Ukraine is now the most mined nation in the world.",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po,Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?,2025-03-18T11:27:09.755Z,"Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor","When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days.
He wanted to overthrow the pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.
Putin failed. But more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands, and the US - until recently Ukraine's strongest ally - has held direct talks with Russia over ending the war.
A joint US-Ukrainian proposal to pause fighting for 30 days has yet to be agreed by Russia.
As Putin launched the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, he gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine.
Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.
Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.
Putin then prompted a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.
But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.
Putin had just recognised the rebel states as independent. Then, as the invasion began, he said the people there - many of whom are Russian speakers - needed protection from the Kyiv ""regime"".
A day later, Putin called on Ukraine's military to ""take power into your own hands"" and target the ""gangs of drug addicts and neo-Nazis"" running the government.
Putin then added another objective - to ensure Ukraine stayed neutral. He accused the Western defensive alliance, Nato, of trying to gain a foothold in Ukraine to bring its troops closer to Russia's borders.
The Russian leader has long questioned Ukraine's right to exist, claiming that ""modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia"" after the communist revolution in 1917.
In a long-winded 2021 essay he even suggested ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century. Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an ""artificial state"".
Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.
Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.
Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.
Fact-checking Putin's 'nonsense' history
Zelensky - from comedian to wartime leader
Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.
Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.
""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.
""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.""
Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.
Even now, three years on, Putin refuses direct peace talks with Zelensky ""because of his illegitimacy"" - a false narrative that has been repeated by President Trump.
As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.
Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.
Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.
Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.
But it was Russia who launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.
After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.
Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories ""with no aggressive intentions"". Sweden and Finland have joined Nato in the past two years precisely because of the perceived Russian threat.
It is part of Ukraine's constitution to join the European Union and Nato, but there was no real prospect of this when the full-scale war began.
Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: ""Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine.""
He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should ""forget about"" joining the Western alliance.
Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.
Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.
Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand ""an inch to the East"".
However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
Gorbachev said ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time.
Read more: What is Nato?
At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian ""bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.
More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. Germany's chancellor called the allegation ""ridiculous"".
The Russian taunts of Nazis in charge in Kyiv are also not correct.
Modern Ukraine has no far-right parties in parliament - they failed to get enough votes in the 2019 elections. On top of that, Zelensky is Jewish and many of his relatives were murdered by the Nazis in World War Two.
Putin condemns him as a ""disgrace to the Jewish people"", but the US Holocaust Memorial Museum rejects his claims outright, saying he ""misrepresented and misappropriated Holocaust history"".
Putin himself was accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court in 2024, although that has been rejected by the Kremlin.
Russia's attempt to stop Ukraine leaving its sphere of influence goes back years, and its initial invasion began in 2014 when pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after months of mass demonstrations.
Yanukovych had abandoned an EU deal under Putin's pressure, prompting protests that ended when snipers shot dead dozens of demonstrators. Yanukovych soon fled to Russia.
Putin quickly seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and Russian proxies took up arms against the government, occupying parts of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Two attempts to stop the war came to nothing.
They were known as the Minsk agreements and were brokered by France, Germany and Russia itself. They reduced the scale of violence, but Zelensky has called them a trap that created a frozen conflict on Russia's terms.
Both sides accused each other of violations, and the Kremlin said ultimately the failed accords were a precursor to Moscow's full-scale invasion.
The Ukrainian leader has warned the Trump administration not to trust Putin: ""He broke the ceasefire, he killed our people.""

What minerals does Ukraine have?
Tracking the war in maps
After three years of offensives and counter-offensives, Russian and Ukrainian forces are in a war of attrition on an active front line of more than 1,000km (629 miles).
Neither side has any realistic prospect of winning this war.
Russia annexed four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine after sham referendums in 2022, and yet it can really only claim to have full control of one of them, Luhansk.
Ukrainian forces were able to liberate large areas of the north and parts of the south in 2022, but more recent counter-offensives have not had the same success.
They still control a small part of Russia's Kursk region after launching an offensive in August 2024, but have lost control of all major settlements there. Ukrainian troops have also lost ground in the east.
Much of Russia's firepower has been turned towards the Donetsk region, as towns and villages are destroyed in a slow and grinding advance.
The war is taking its toll on Russia's economy, with high interest rates and inflation and defence spending this year of at least 33% of the federal budget.
Ukraine has lost a big part of its economic wealth to Russian occupation and destruction in its industrial east. Growth has been hit by attacks on its energy infrastructure.
Although inflation and interest rates are high, Ukraine has secured Western aid to cover its budget deficit.
Tens of thousands of people have died since Putin sent in the troops in 2022.
Ukraine's president has spoken of 43,000 Ukrainian military deaths, but open source site ualosses.org suggests the number is above 70,000.
More than 12,000 civilians have lost their lives in Ukraine, according to the UN.
Russia rarely admits to military losses, but BBC analysis estimates that Russian deaths could range from 146,194 to 211,169.
The war has forced 6.9 million Ukrainians to seek refuge abroad, and a further 3.7 million to flee their homes inside Ukraine.
At the start, Putin did not even call it war but a ""special military operation"". Eventually in 2024 he accepted it was, but claimed it was instigated by Kyiv or its ""Western handlers"".
Putin appears to believe that Ukraine should remain in Russia's sphere of influence because of the historical links between the two countries.
From 1922-91 Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and many Ukrainians speak Russian especially in the east, including Volodymyr Zelensky who is a native speaker.
Many Russians view Crimea as their own. It was annexed by Catherine the Great in 1783 and handed to Ukraine by Soviet leader Khrushchev in 1954. Ten years earlier, his predecessor Stalin had deported Crimea's Tatar population, so the majority population was ethnic Russian.
Since 1991 Ukraine has been an independent state. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.
Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.",Europe

BBC News NI","The last surviving Battle of Britain pilot, John ""Paddy"" Hemingway, has died at the age of 105.
Mr Hemingway, who was originally from Dublin, joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a teenager before World War Two.
At 21, he was a fighter pilot in the Battle of Britain, a three-month period when air force personnel defended the skies against a large-scale assault by the German air force, the Luftwaffe.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer paid tribute to Mr Hemingway, saying his courage and those of all RAF pilots had ""helped end WWII and secure our freedom"".
The Prince of Wales also paid tribute, saying that ""we owe so much to Paddy and his generation for our freedoms today"".
Prince William added that ""their bravery and sacrifice will always be remembered"".
The Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Emma Little-Pengelly described Mr Hemingway as ""an absolute hero"".
Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly she said: ""My goodness when you read his obituary, the things that he experienced.""
She added that the sacrifices of Mr Hemingway's generation were ""absolutely incredible"".
Those who fought in the three-and-a-half-month battle came to be known as ""The Few"" after a speech by the then Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill.
""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few,"" he said of their sacrifices in battle.
In a statement, the RAF said that Mr Hemingway had ""passed away peacefully"" on Monday.
The pilot's squadron shot down 90 enemy aircraft during an 11-day period in May 1940, and provided fighter cover during the Battle of France.
During the war, Gp Capt Hemingway was shot down four times.
During dogfights – or one-on-one aerial combats - in August 1940, Mr Hemingway was forced to bail out of his Hurricane single-seat fighter on two occasions, landing in the sea off the coast of Essex and in marshland.
The wreckage of his Hurricane was recovered in 2019 with the control column and the gun-button still set to ""fire"".
In July 1941, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross - awarded to RAF personnel for an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty while flying on active operations.
On the way to receive his medal from the King, he was forced to escape from a Blenheim aircraft, which crashed during take-off.
While serving with the 85 Squadron in RAF Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, Mr Hemingway was forced to bail out of his Havoc night fighter at 600ft (183m) due to instrument failure in bad weather.
He broke his hand on the tail section and his parachute failed to open, with the chute catching on the branches of a tree.
He was forced to bail out a fourth time while fighting near Ravenna, Italy, when his Spitfire was hit multiple times. He landed in enemy territory, and made contact with Italian citizens, who helped him back to the Allies.
Speaking to BBC News NI in 2023, Gp Capt Hemingway said he had never looked for fame for being part of ""The Few"".
""I don't think we ever assumed greatness of any form,"" he said.
""We were just fighting a war which we were trained to fight.""
Mr Hemingway said that his biggest regret was the loss of friends, in particular that of Richard ""Dickie"" Lee in August 1940.
The RAF said that Mr Hemingway's passing marked ""the end of an era and a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for freedom during World War II"".
""His courage in the face of overwhelming odds demonstrated his sense of duty and the importance of British resilience.""
Mr Hemingway ""always had a twinkle in his eyes as he recalled the fun times with colleagues in France and London"", the statement said.
""This quiet, composed, thoughtful and mischievous individual may not have wanted to be the last of 'The Few', but he embodied the spirit of all those who flew sorties over this green and pleasant land,"" it added.
Chief of RAF Air Staff Sir Rich Knighton said he had spent time with Mr Hemingway in Dublin earlier this year.

South Caucasus correspondent","Most of the villagers in Chorvila in north-west Georgia adore Bidzina Ivanishvili, their proudest son who's widely seen as the country's real man in power.
It's a picture postcard settlement where the roads are good, the houses well-maintained and there are plenty of blue and yellow flags of the ruling Georgian Dream party.
""All this area where you can see new houses and roads was made by our man. There was nothing without him and he did everything for us,"" says resident Mamia Machavariani, pointing at the village from a nearby forest.
Ivanishvili founded Georgian Dream (GD) and the party has been in power for 12 years.
For more than four months, Georgians have taken to the streets across the country to accuse Ivanishvili's party of rigging elections last October and accusing GD of trying to move the country away from its path to the EU and back into Russia's sphere of influence.
GD denies that and in Chorvila you will not find anyone with a bad word to say about its billionaire son.
Ivanishvili made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, first by selling computers before he acquired banks and metal assets. He returned to Georgia in 2003.
Every newlywed couple in Chorvila receives a cash gift of $3,000 (£2,300) from Ivanishvili, according to Temuri Kapanadze, who teaches history at the village school where Ivanishvili went as a boy.
Unlike most schools in rural Georgia, it has its own swimming pool and an indoor basketball court.
""He reconstructed the hospital, he built two churches, he fixed all the roads, he made all roofs across the region,"" Temuri says.
""I personally received a refrigerator, TV, a gas stove and for five years Mr Bidzina has been helping us by paying 200 laris (£55) every month.""
Here they accuse the opposition of orchestrating the pro-EU anti-government protests and using young people as their ""tools"".
""We also want Europe but with our traditions, and that's what the government wants too,"" says resident Giorgi Burjenidze. ""We are a Christian country, and our traditions means that men must be men, and women must be women. President Trump thinks like us too.""
The view that Europe has been trying to impose values alien to Georgian traditions, such as gay rights, is often repeated by state ministers and pro-government media.
They have also been dismissive of the daily protests sparked by the Georgian Dream's decision to suspend talks with the European Union on the country's future membership.
""Fire to the oligarchy"" has become one of the main slogans at the ongoing protests to address what people say is the overwhelming influence of Bidzina Ivanishvili on the country's politics.
""Georgia currently is ruled by an oligarch who has a very Russian agenda,"" says Tamara Arveladze, 26, who has joined the protests in the capital Tbilisi almost every day, to fight what she sees as Ivanishvili's overwhelming influence.
""He owns everything, all the institutions and all the governmental forces and resources. He sees this country as his private property, and he is ruling this country as if it were his own business.""
Last month, Tamara and her boyfriend were caught up in an incident which was captured on mobile phones and went viral. They were driving towards the protest site, and shouted the words ""fire to the oligarchy"" when a number of masked policemen surrounded the car and tried to break in.
""It happened in seconds, but it felt like hours. I was shocked how aggressively they were trying to do this, if they'd happened to take us out of the car I don't know what would have happened.""
Tamara's boyfriend has had his driving license revoked for a year and could face a jail term for swearing at police. She has been fined $3,600, an enormous sum in Georgia, where the average monthly salary is closer to $500.
Since the disputed parliamentary election, criticised by international observers, the Georgian opposition has been boycotting the parliament, leaving the ruling Georgian Dream to rubber stamp any proposed changes to law.
""We are witnessing the abuse of the law-making,"" says Tamar Oniani, human rights programme director at the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association.
""First it was banning the face masks, and then they deployed the face recognition cameras in Tbilisi. So it makes it easier for them to detect who is appearing at the rally and then order high fines.""
Last month fines went up ten-fold for blocking the road or disobeying the police and Tamar Oniani says in one day alone they received 150 calls from protesters who had been fined.
Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has recently denounced the protesters as an ""amorphous mass"" and sarcastically thanked them for ""replenishing the state budget"" with heavy fines.
Tamar Oniani says the ""judiciary is fully captured"" and acts as one of the instruments against the demonstrators, who she says have been beaten in custody.
""They were tortured just for being part of the protest and being a supporter of Georgia's European future.""
The government denies these allegations.
Since the protests began last November, hundreds of civil servants have lost their jobs after they signed petitions criticising the government's decision to suspend talks with the EU.
""The government decided to cleanse the public sector of employees who were not loyal to them,"" says Nini Lezhava, who was among those to lose their jobs.
She was in a senior position in Georgia's parliamentary research centre, which had been tasked with providing unbiased reports for members of parliament and has since been abolished.
""They don't need it anymore. They have their own policy and they do not want anyone with independent analytical capacity,"" she says.
Nini says a similar ""cleansing"" has been taking place at the defence and justice ministries, and other government institutions: ""It is happening in the entire public sector of Georgia"".
""They are trying to create another Russian satellite in this region. And that goes beyond Georgia and beyond the Black Sea, beyond the South Caucasus, because we see what is happening in the world. And that is a bigger geopolitical shift.""
In Chorvila, history teacher Temuri Kapanadze sees the government's approach towards Russia very differently: ""There are no friends and enemies forever. Yesterday's enemy can become today's friend.""

Royal correspondent, BBC News","King Charles III and Queen Camilla are going ahead with the state visit to Italy and the Vatican, including plans for a meeting with Pope Francis.
The Pope has been ill - but Buckingham Palace says the trip will continue as planned, from 7-10 April, with engagements in Rome and Ravenna.
The King had privately sent a letter to the Pope, when he was taken ill - but a photo released by the Vatican at the weekend appeared to show the 88-year-old was slowly recovering.
The visit will see a symbolic building of links between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, of which King Charles is the Supreme Governor.
As well as meeting the Pope, the King will attend an ecumenical service in the Sistine Chapel.
And in what the Palace says is a ""historic first"", he will also visit the Papal Basilica of Saint Paul's Outside the Walls.
Kings dating back to the Anglo-Saxon era helped support and fund this church, where Saint Paul is buried - and the visit by King Charles will be seen as a sign of reconciliation and bringing together these historic threads.
There will also be a personal dimension to the state visit, as the trip to Rome coincides with the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary.
The visit will support the modern-day relationships between the UK and Italy, reflecting ""shared values, history and culture"".
That includes Italian food - and as a warm-up to the visit, the King hosted a dinner at Highgrove, with the menu inspired by American-Italian actor Stanley Tucci.
The King will meet Italy's president and prime minister and become the first UK monarch to address both houses of the Italian parliament.
The royal visitors will be guests at a state banquet.
And military links will be promoted with a joint flypast over Rome by the Italian air force and the UK's Red Arrows.
In Ravenna, the royal couple will view the tomb of the Italian writer Dante, and the Queen will tour a museum commemorating the poet Lord Byron.",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg102564g2o,Germany set to vote on historic increase in defence spending,2025-03-18T01:00:24.768Z,"Frank Gardner
Security correspondent
Reporting fromBerlin","What happens today, here in Berlin, will impact the entire future of Europe's defence and its ongoing support for Ukraine.
Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, is voting on whether to take the brakes off defence spending. This could pave the way for a massive uplift in military investment just as Russia makes gains in Ukraine and Washington signals that Europe can no longer rely on US protection.
""This vote in the Bundestag is absolutely crucial,"" says Prof Monika Schnitzer, who chairs Germany's Council of Economic Experts.
""After the Munich Security Conference, then the Trump-Zelensky row, Europe got a wake-up call. For the first time Europeans may not be able to rely on Washington. A lot of people had sleepless nights after that.""
""The outlook for European defence spending hinges on developments in Germany, as the holder of the region's largest defence budget,"" agrees Dr Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defence economics at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Defence spending in Germany rose by 23.2% last year, helping to drive a record 11.7% rise in European defence outlay.
""The remarkable initiatives announced in Germany are key to enabling further growth,"" adds Dr McGerty.
""Without them, any progress made on strengthening Germany's military capability may have stalled.""
Germany's incoming new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is in a race against time.
The new parliament convenes on 25 March and not everyone is in favour of all this money being spent, especially on defence.
Both the far-right AfD party and the far-left Linke have vowed to oppose it. The vote needs two-thirds in favour to go through, so Merz has a better chance of this happening today, under the existing (old) parliament. It then needs to be approved by Germany's upper house.
Meanwhile Europe is still coming to terms with the shock of announcements coming from the Trump administration.
At last month's Munich Security Conference I watched as delegates sat open-mouthed listening to US Vice-President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on migration and free speech.
This was preceded days earlier by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth telling Nato members that America's 80-year-long defensive umbrella for Europe should no longer be taken for granted.
Defence strategists in Europe are already planning for the unthinkable: a semi-victorious Russia making gains in Ukraine, then rebuilding its army and threatening Nato's eastern members, such as the Baltic states, within three years or less.
This, at a time when the US commitment to Europe's defence is looking extremely shaky. President Trump is being urged by some in his circle to pull US troops out of Europe and even to withdraw from Nato altogether.
There is talk of France extending its national nuclear deterrent to cover other European nations.
Meanwhile, most European governments are under pressure to raise defence spending after years of cuts.
The British Army has now shrunk to its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars, over 200 years ago, and experts predict it would run out of ammunition within two weeks of fighting a full-scale conventional war in Europe.
Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.
Which brings us back to today's crucial vote in the Bundestag. It is not just about defence. One part is about freeing up €500bn (£420bn) for German infrastructure – fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.
The other part is about removing the restrictions in the constitution on borrowing that could, in theory, free up unlimited billions of euros for defence spending, both for Germany's armed forces and for a pan-European defence fund. On 4 March European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen announced plans for an €800bn defence fund called The ReArm Europe Fund.
The proposal being voted on in Berlin is that any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP (national wealth) would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now this debt ceiling has been fixed at 0.35 pct of GDP.
Other countries will be watching closely to see if this proposal passes. If it does not, then the EU Commission's 'ReArm Europe' project could be off to a shaky start.
The challenge today for Europe's security is a stark one. If the US no longer has its back, or at the very least cannot be relied upon to come to Europe's defence, then what does the continent need to do to fill the gap?
Let's start with the numbers. According to the Kiel Institute, which meticulously tracks these things, Europe spends just 0.1% of its wealth on helping to defend Ukraine, while the US has been spending 0.15%.
""That means,"" says the Kiel Institute's Giuseppe Irto, ""that if Europe is to make up the shortfall then it needs to double its contribution to 0.21%.""
But regardless of what happens today in Berlin this is not just about money.
Many of the most sought-after weapons in Ukraine's armoury have come from the US, like Patriot air defence and long-range artillery systems like Himars. The Kiel Institute puts the proportion of Ukraine's rocket artillery at 86% coming from the US, with 82% of its howitzer ammunition also being US-sourced.
Then there is the whole question of US intelligence aid for Kyiv, much of it derived from satellites and geospatial imagery. If Washington were to permanently switch that off, then Ukrainian forces risk being partially blinded.
If America's nuclear arsenal is taken out of the equation then there is a massive disparity between Russia's 5,000-plus warheads and the combined total of Britain and France's nukes which amount to less than a tenth of that. But that still theoretically leaves enough to act as a nuclear deterrent.
When it comes to ""conventional"", ie. non-nuclear arms, Western defence chiefs are fond of saying that Nato's combined forces are superior to Russia's.
Maybe, but if there is one glaring lesson to come out of the Ukraine war it is that ""mass"" matters. Russia's army may be of poor quality but President Putin has been able to throw such huge numbers of men, drones, shells and missiles at Ukraine's front lines that the Russians are inexorably advancing, albeit slowly and at huge cost.
This should not come as a surprise. Moscow put its economy on to a war footing some time ago. It appointed an economist as its defence minister and retooled many of its factories to churn out vast quantities of munitions, especially explosive-tipped drones.
While many European nations have dragged their feet over raising defence spending much above the Nato-mandated 2% of GDP, Russia's is closer to 7%. Around 40% of Russia's national budget is spent on defence.
So Europe has a fair bit of catching up to do if it is to even come close to shoring up its defence and security.
""If the vote passes then it will be significant for Germany and for Europe,"" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank.
""It will set a precedent and allow others to follow... However, three years on from the invasion of Ukraine the case of Germany is a reminder that more money for defence is necessary but not sufficient.
""Europe needs defence and security leaders who are able to navigate a rapidly deteriorating Euro-Atlantic security environment. Cultural, rather than financial reform, would be most valuable to Europe right now.""",Europe

Gardaí (Irish police) arrested the driver of the car, who is in his late teens, at the scene and he remains in custody.
The second pedestrian, a man also in his 60s, remains in hospital with serious injuries.
The Mayor of the Municipal District of Letterkenny and Milford, Gerry McMonagle, said the incident was an ""awful shock"" to the local community.
He told Irish broadcaster RTÉ that about 200 people had attended the vigil, which was held at the scene of the fatal crash on Monday evening.

BBC News NI","Irish political leaders have said Conor McGregor does not speak for Ireland after he visited the White House for a St Patrick's Day meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Earlier, McGregor told reporters that he was going to voice concerns about immigration issues in Ireland when he spoke to the president.
Accompanied by his partner and four children, the controversial MMA fighter praised the president's work ethic as ""inspiring"" as he met him in the Oval Office.
Trump hailed McGregor's own work rate, and described him as ""fantastic"".
Last week, during a meeting at the White House with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin, the US president praised McGregor's tattoos.
The fighter also attended President Trump's inauguration in January.
In 2024, a woman who accused McGregor of raping her in a Dublin hotel won a claim against him for damages in a civil case.
A jury found that he had assaulted her and ordered him to pay more than €248,000 (£206,000).
Earlier on Monday, McGregor appeared at the White House press briefing room lectern with press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who confirmed the meeting was scheduled for later in the day.
Ms Leavitt said she ""couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on St Patrick's Day"".
The fighter said he planned to ""raise the issues the people of Ireland face"".
He accused the Irish government of ""abandoning"" the voices of the people of Ireland as he criticised immigration policies.
""What is going on in Ireland is a travesty,"" he said.
""Our money is being spent on overseas issues that is nothing to do with the Irish people,"" he added.
McGregor has previously spoken out against Ireland's policies on immigration and asylum seekers.
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin was critical of McGregor's comments, posting on social media: ""St Patrick's Day around the world is a day rooted in community, humanity, friendship and fellowship.
""Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland,"" Martin added.
Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Harris said the MMA fighter has visited Washington DC in a ""personal capacity"" and that he is not representing the country.
""He doesn't speak for Ireland. He doesn't speak for the people of Ireland. He has no mandate to do such,"" Harris said to reporters in New York.
He said the president is ""perfectly entitled"" to invite whoever he wishes to the White House.
""But let me be very clear, Conor McGregor is not here in the United States representing Ireland or the people of Ireland.""
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) assembly member Matthew O'Toole described McGregor's White House appearance as an ""insult to the island of Ireland"" and ""deeply depressing"".
""That Trump and his administration thought on Ireland's national day to invite and clearly make a huge effort to platform and amplify McGregor, who is an appalling individual, is frankly beyond the pale,"" he told BBC News NI.
On Monday, McGregor was also pictured alongside Elon Musk in the Oval Office.

Reporting fromLondon","Thousands of people have protested in the North Macedonian town of Kocani, demanding justice and action against corruption after a nightclub fire killed 59 people, many of them teenagers.
""Nobody should die like that – nobody,"" a teenage boy told the BBC. ""Those kids, they had a future, they had talents.""
The Pulse nightclub was packed with fans watching DNK, a popular hip-hop band, when sparks from flares apparently set a patch of ceiling ablaze.
About 20 people have been detained for questioning over the disaster, including the nightclub owner and some former government ministers.
Many in Kocani believe that corruption had allowed the improvised venue to operate with inadequate safety measures.
Relatives of children who are still missing have been queueing outside a hospital to give DNA samples to help with identification.
Kocani, a town of about 25,000 people, lies some 100km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje.
More than 160 people were injured in the blaze, including 45 suffering very serious injuries. Many of them have been flown to hospitals in neighbouring Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey for specialist treatment.
At the protest rally, the uncle of a 19-year-old man who died said ""those scenes should never be repeated"".
""When there was a war here, it wasn't as bad as that. So many young people have died.""
After a long time standing in silence the crowd started chanting ""we are asking for justice!""
Mourners lit candles, hugged and cried, and wrote messages of condolence in the central square.
A group of teenagers targeted a bar, smashing windows and ransacking it, believing it to belong to the Pulse club owner.
The deadly fire began around 02:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Sunday and spread rapidly as the ceiling was made of flammable material, Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said.
He said there are ""grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption"" linked to the fire.
There were 500 people inside the venue at the time, well over capacity for the 250 tickets sold, he said.
Officials say the club's licence had been obtained illegally and the venue was a converted carpet warehouse, whose single emergency exit was locked at the time.
There were just two fire extinguishers and no fire alarm or sprinkler system, state prosecutor Ljupco Kocevski said.

Two Ukrainian suspects have been arrested – one in Lithuania, the other in Poland – over the attack, which prosecutor Arturas Urbelis called ""an act of terrorism"".
He said investigation of intermediaries had established that ""this is connected with the military intelligence, with the security services"".
Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Lithuania had ""confirmed our suspicions that responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services.""

The arson attack in Vilnius last May did not cause casualties, but that month a similar attack destroyed a huge shopping mall in the Polish capital Warsaw.

She mainly acted in French-language films but also appeared as police officer Laurence Relaud in 2014 BBC TV drama The Missing.
Rosetta, a poignant tale about a teenager's struggle to overcome a life of misery, was Dequenne's first screen role.
She had been unemployed after losing her job in a food factory when she was picked for the role.
""The first day she filmed in front of a real camera, she managed to bring the whole team together,"" Luc Dardenne, who directed it with his brother Jean-Pierre, said in a tribute to broadcaster RTBF.
""It got better and better as the shoot progressed... She was magnificent and the film owes a lot to her.""

BBC News","A court in Georgia has handed a further prison sentence to the jailed former president, Mikheil Saakashvili.
Saakashvili was sentenced on Monday to four-and-a-half years behind bars for illegally crossing the border when returning to the country from exile in 2021, his lawyer said.
He is already serving concurrent terms for embezzlement and abuse of power while in office, bringing his total sentence to more than 12 years.
Saakashvili has always denied wrongdoing and called his latest sentence ""illegal"" and ""unjust"". Rights groups say his imprisonment is politically motivated.
Saakashvili opposes the governing Georgian Dream party, which favours closer ties with Russia. As president, he sought to forge closer relations with Western governments.
In a video posted on X on Monday from the hospital where he is being held, Saakashvili said: ""No matter what, I will fight to the end.""
The former president was sentenced last week to nine years behind bars for embezzlement, running alongside the jail term he had already been serving. In 2018, he was tried in absentia and sentenced in two separate trials.
Saakashvili was arrested in 2021 after making a surprise return to Georgia ahead of the country's local elections by smuggling himself into the country on a ferry from Ukraine.
He called for mass anti-government demonstrations, but was quickly arrested by Georgian authorities.
The 57-year-old had led Georgia over two terms between 2004 and 2013. Since leaving the country, he had for the most part lived in Ukraine.
He was granted Ukrainian citizenship in 2015, renouncing his Georgian citizenship when he became governor of Ukraine's Odesa region.
His citizenship was revoked in 2017 before being restored again by President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019.
""This [sentence] is basically sending a message... to President Zelensky, for them to scare him to show what happens when you don't surrender your country... I did not surrender Georgia,"" Saakashvili said in his video address while wearing a black shirt with the words ""I'm Ukrainian"" emblazoned on it.
Zelensky, who appointed Saakashvili to oversee reforms in Ukraine, has demanded his transfer to Kyiv.
He has previously accused Russia of ""killing"" Saakashvili ""at the hands of the Georgian authorities"".
The European Union has repeatedly called for Saakashvili's immediate release from prison, expressing concern over his deteriorating health.

""Everyone started screaming and shouting 'get out, get out!'"" the 19-year-old told Reuters.
People desperately tried to escape the flames but there was only one exit for around 500 people, as the only other door at the back of the venue was locked.
""I don't know how but I ended up on the ground, I couldn't get up and at that moment people started stomping on me,"" Ms Taseva said.

The fire started around 02:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Sunday when sparks from pyrotechnic devices hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material, Toskovski said.
Described as an ""improvised nightclub"" by the local press, the venue, located in a town around 100km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje, did not have a legal licence to operate, Toskovski said.
It had previously been a carpet warehouse, and police are investigating.

""Inside where they are identifying the victims, the situation is far worse. You see that the parents are also quite young people, in their 40s. Their children are 18 or 20 years old.""
""The situation is brutal, chaotic, the stories are very sad, and unfortunately many young lives are lost.""
One man, whose nephew was injured in the fire, said some people have been unable to locate their children.
Many are angry and searching for answers, like Dragi Stojanov, who lost his only child in the fire.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a ""catastrophic"" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.
The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. Some gave accounts of a ""collapse"" as Ukraine lost Sudzha, the largest town it held.
Ukrainian restrictions on travel to the front have meant it is not possible to get a full picture of the situation. But this is how five Ukrainian soldiers described to us what had happened.
On 9 March, ""Volodymyr"" sent a Telegram post to the BBC saying he was still in Sudzha, where there was ""panic and collapse of the front"".
Ukrainian troops ""are trying to leave - columns of troops and equipment. Some of them are burned by Russian drones on the road. It is impossible to leave during the day.""
Movement of men, logistics and equipment had been reliant on one major route between Sudzha and Ukraine's Sumy region.
Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. By 9 March it was ""all under the fire control of the enemy - drones around the clock. In one minute you can see two to three drones. That's a lot,"" he said.
""We have all the logistics here on one Sudzha-Sumy highway. And everyone knew that the [Russians] would try to cut it. But this again came as a surprise to our command.""
At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.
By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from ""Maksym"".
""A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat,"" he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, ""including large numbers of North Korean soldiers"".
Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.
Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to ""take fire control of the main logistics routes"".
They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.
Maksym said as a result ""the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment"", and that wrecks had ""created congestion on supply routes"".
The situation on that day, 11 March, was described as ""catastrophic"" by ""Anton"".
The third soldier spoken to by the BBC was serving in the headquarters for the Kursk front.
He too highlighted the damage caused by Russian FPV drones. ""We used to have an advantage in drones, now we do not,"" he said. He added that Russia had an advantage with more accurate air strikes and a greater number of troops.
Anton said supply routes had been cut. ""Logistics no longer work – organised deliveries of weapons, ammunition, food and water are no longer possible.""
Anton said he managed to leave Sudzha by foot, at night – ""We almost died several times. Drones are in the sky all the time.""
The soldier predicted Ukraine's entire foothold in Kursk would be lost but that ""from a military point of view, the Kursk direction has exhausted itself. There is no point in keeping it any more"".
Western officials estimate that Ukraine's Kursk offensive involved about 12,000 troops. They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.
Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was ""fully under our control"" and that Ukraine had ""abandoned"" much of its material.
In social media posts on 11-12 March, a fourth soldier, ""Dmytro"" likened the retreat from the front to ""a scene from a horror movie"".
""The roads are littered with hundreds of destroyed cars, armoured vehicles and ATVs (All Terrain Vehicles). There are a lot of wounded and dead.""
Vehicles were often hunted by multiple drones, he said.
He described his own narrow escape when the car he was travelling in got bogged down. He and his fellow soldiers were trying to push the vehicle free when they were targeted by another FPV drone.
It missed the vehicle, but injured one of his comrades. He said they had to hide in a forest for two hours before they were rescued.
Dmytro said many Ukrainians retreated on foot with ""guys walking 15km to 20km"". The situation, he said, had turned from ""difficult and critical to catastrophic"".
In a message on 14 March, Dmytro added: ""Everything is finished in the Kursk region... the operation was not successful.""
He estimated that thousands of Ukrainian soldiers had died since the first crossing into Russia in August.
A fifth soldier sounded less gloomy about the situation. On 13 March, ""Artem"" sent a Telegram message from a military hospital, where he was being treated for shrapnel wounds suffered in a drone attack.
Artem said he had been fighting further west – near the village of Loknya, where Ukrainian forces were putting up a stiff resistance and ""fighting like lions"".
He believed the operation had achieved some success.
""It's important that so far the Armed Forces of Ukraine have created this buffer zone, thanks to which the Russians cannot enter Sumy,"" he said.
Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to ""more favourable positions"", remain in Kursk, and would do so ""for as long as it is expedient and necessary"".
He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.
However, the situation now is very different to last August. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.
Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.
Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had ""accomplished its task"" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.
But it is not yet clear at what cost.",Europe

""We will demand that ironclad security guarantees become part of this agreement,"" Alexander Grushko told Russian media outlet Izvestia.
""Part of these guarantees should be the neutral status of Ukraine, the refusal of Nato countries to accept it into the alliance,"" he said.
It comes as US President Donald Trump has said he will speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, as talks continue over a possible ceasefire in the three-year war in Ukraine.
Speaking on Air Force One on Sunday evening, Trump said: ""A lot of work's been done over the weekend. We want to see if we can bring that war to an end.""
""We will be talking about land. We will be talking about power plants,"" Trump said when asked about concessions.
Trump added that he was already discussing ""dividing up certain assets"" between Russia and Ukraine.
The US and Ukraine have agreed to propose a 30-day ceasefire to Russia.
While Putin said that he supported a ceasefire, he also set out a list of tough conditions for achieving peace.
One of the areas of contention is Russia's western Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory.
Putin has claimed Russia is fully back in control of Kursk, and said Ukrainian troops there ""have been isolated"".
He has also raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east.
Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Putin of trying to ""sabotage"" diplomatic efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire.
US envoy Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin on Thursday in Moscow, earlier declined to answer a question on how Russian-occupied land in Ukraine could be addressed in a potential deal, during an interview with CNN. Russia currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine.
During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022, on ""day one"" of a new administration.
Less than a month after he was inaugurated, Trump had call with Putin that reportedly spanned 90 minutes about immediately starting negotiations on ending the war.",Europe

Reporting fromKocani","Police have detained 15 people after a fire at a nightclub in North Macedonia killed at least 59 people, officials have said.
The blaze broke out around 02:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Sunday at the Pulse club in Kocani, where about 500 people had gathered for a concert by DNK, a popular hip-hop duo in the country.
Only one member of the band survived and was being treated in hospital, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office told the BBC's Newshour. In total, 155 were injured at the concert.
Interior Minister Pance Toskovski has said the detainees will be questioned, adding that there are ""grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption"" linked to the fire.
He said that the venue did not have a legal licence to operate.
The venue, in a town around 100km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje, has been described as an ""improvised nightclub"" in the local press, having previously been a carpet warehouse.
Biljana Arsovska, spokesperson for the public prosecutor's office, said there had been only ""one efficient exit"" in the building, as the venue's back door was locked and could not be used.
The first on-site inspections on Sunday had also showed several ""abnormalities"" in the venue. ""There are deficiencies in the system for fire-extinguishing and the system for lightning,"" she said.
Citing initial reports, Toskovski said the fire had been started by sparks from pyrotechnic devices that had hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material.
Footage shows the band - which formed in 2002 and has topped the North Macedonian charts over the past decade - playing on stage when two flares go off, after which sparks catch fire on the ceiling before spreading rapidly.
Video verified by the BBC shows people trying to extinguish the flames on the ceiling. The footage shows the club was still full and some people appeared to be watching efforts to put out the fire rather than leaving.
Reports suggest the fact there was only a single entry and exit point to the improvised nightclub caused panic.
Marija Taseva, 20, told Channel 5 TV she was caught in a crush at the club as people rushed for the exits. She recalled falling to the ground and being trampled during the chaos before managing to get out.
""I don't know how, but somehow I managed to get out,"" she told the Reuters news agency. ""I'm fine now, but there are many dead.""
She added that her 25-year-old sister - who her family had previously been searching for - had died, saying: ""I was saved and she wasn't.""
Red Cross volunteer Mustafa Saidov said most of those affected were young people aged 18 to 20. Officials say more than 20 of the injured and three of those killed were under 18.
""The situation is brutal, chaotic, the stories are very sad, and unfortunately many young lives are lost,"" Mr Saidov added.
Dr Vladislav Gruev, a specialist in reconstructive and plastic surgery at the University Clinic for Surgical Diseases in the capital, told the BBC most of the patients being treated at his hospital arrived with extensive burns.
""[They have] second and third degree burns in the head, neck and upper torso,"" he said.
Kocani's hospital director earlier said that staff had initially been struggling to identify patients due to a lack of ID cards. Eighteen patients were assessed as being in a critical condition.
Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski called it a ""difficult and very sad day"" for the country, which had lost many ""young lives"".
The government has declared seven days of national mourning, and the government is holding an emergency session as part of ongoing investigations on how the incident unfolded.
North Macedonia's President, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, said she was shocked ""as a mother, as a person, as a president"". Addressing the bereaved directly, she added: ""Your immense pain is mine too.""
""No business or activity can function without standards and rules,"" she wrote in a statement. ""Let us not allow anyone to endanger the lives of innocent people again.""
Siljanovska-Davkova added that the most seriously injured were being taken to received treatment in specialist clinics in Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey.
European leaders have voiced their condolences, with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen saying the EU ""stands in solidarity with the people of North Macedonia in this difficult time"".
Neighbouring Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic called it ""a tragedy of immense magnitude"", adding that fears remain as ""many more people will not be able to withstand the level of injuries they have at this moment"".

BBC News","The Vatican has released the first image of Pope Francis since he was admitted to hospital a month ago.
The photo shows the pontiff sitting in a wheelchair in front of an altar at a chapel in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, where he has been recovering from pneumonia.
Earlier on Sunday, in his written Angelus message, the Pope said he faced a ""period of trial"" as he thanked well-wishers for their prayers, and prayed for peace in ""countries wounded by war"".
It marked the fifth Sunday in a row that the Pope was not present in person for his weekly blessing. The Vatican said earlier this week that an X-ray had confirmed ""improvements"" in his condition, but that he still needed hospital treatment.
""The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy,"" it said in a statement on Saturday, adding that they were ""showing further, gradual improvements"".
Pope Francis, 88, has not been seen in public since his admission to hospital on 14 February - and until Sunday, no photographs had been released.
""I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me,"" the Pope said in his latest statement, released earlier in the day.
""Let us continue to pray for peace, especially in the countries wounded by war: tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.""
Since his arrival in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, the Pope has been treated for double pneumonia and other infections.
He has also suffered several respiratory crises, which has raised concerns about his survival.
Earlier on this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis speaking in his native Spanish was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City.
His voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers.
Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, is the first Pope from the Americas.
He contracted pleurisy as a young man and had a partial lung removal, which has left him particularly vulnerable to pneumonia.
As a result of his long road to recovery, there has been speculation that Pope Francis could choose to follow his predecessor Benedict XVI in resigning the papacy.
But friends and biographers close to the Pope have insisted that he has no plans to step down. And, despite his fragile health, the pontiff has continued his work from hospital.
This year is a Catholic Holy Year, with 32 million pilgrims expected to travel to Rome.",Europe

BBC Balkans correspondent","Hundreds of thousands of people descended on Serbia's capital on Saturday to protest over the deaths of 15 people in a railway station collapse.
While the government put attendance at 107,000 across Belgrade, an independent monitor said 325,000 - if not more - had gathered, making it Serbia's largest protest ever.
The Novi Sad collapse last November has galvanised anger towards the government and President Aleksandar Vucic. Demonstrators blame corruption and corner-cutting for the loss of life.
They believe the disaster reflects more than a decade of governing by the Progressive Party of Vucic - who closely associated himself with the station's recent renovation.
Despite multiple resignations - and Vucic's insistence that he is going nowhere - the protests have only continued to grow.
""We just want a country that works,"" law student Jana Vasic told the BBC in the growing crowd in Belgrade.
""We want institutions that do their jobs properly. We don't care what party is in power. But we need a country that works, not one where you don't get justice for more than four months.""
Republic Square - just one of the four meeting points around Serbia's capital for the ""15th for 15"" protest - was full to overflowing on Saturday.
Some took refuge on the plinth of Prince Mihajlo's statue - the traditional spot for Belgraders to meet, the equivalent of Eros in London's Piccadilly.
Others queued up along the road in front of the National Museum, stretching all the way back to Students' Square.
The other meeting points were every bit as crowded ahead of the planned rendezvous in front of the National Assembly.
The Public Meeting Archive said 275,000-325,000 had attended the protest - ""with the possibility that the number was even higher"".
""Due to the extraordinary size, dynamic nature and structure of the assembly, as well as the unclear situation in some parts of the city... a more precise assessment is not possible,"" it added.
Serbian media reports 22 people were arrested and 56 others injured.
While the protests over the Novi Sad collapse began with students, they have been joined by taxi drivers, farmers and lawyers.
Ahead of the big protest, motorbike riders pulled up outside the National Assembly, facing off against the tractors surrounding a camp of pro-government counter-protesters.
Then a parade of military veterans received a rousing welcome. They said they would make a citizen's arrest on anyone who attacked the students.
The students have been calling for full transparency and accountability over the collapse of a concrete and glass canopy at the station in Serbia's second city, which was renovated and only reopened - by Vucic - in 2022.
They want the government to publish all the documentation relating to the renovation project and say they are not satisfied with the papers the authorities have released so far.
They also want those responsible for the disaster to be charged and convicted. Prosecutors have indicted at least 16 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic.
But the charges have yet to go to trial. And the students insist they will continue with their protests until the authorities meet all their demands.
""We're making progress,"" a student representing Belgrade University's philosophy faculty told the BBC. ""But at this point none of our demands have been met completely.""
""A couple of politicians have resigned from their offices,"" noted another. ""But they weren't fired. We're yet to see anything but empty promises"".
Prime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation at the end of January. But that has yet to be ratified by the National Assembly and he remains in his post.
But the real power in Serbia lies with Vucic, who insists that he is going nowhere.
""I don't give in to blackmail,"" he told a media conference on the eve of the big protest. ""I won't allow the street to pave a horrible future for this country.""
Addressing the nation on Saturday, Vucic praised the police, adding that he was proud that ""we managed to preserve the peace"".
He said that he ""understood"" the protesters' message, and that ""we will have to change ourselves"".
Vucic has described the student protests as ""well-intentioned"". But he had less flattering words for opposition parties, labelling them members of a ""criminal cartel"". He accused them of attempting to force the formation of a ""fraudulent interim government"".
Borko Stefanovic does not deny that the opposition parties are looking for the establishment of a ""government of experts"".
The deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice describes it as the ""only rational way out"" of the political crisis, which would establish the conditions for fresh elections.
Like other opposition leaders, Stefanovic says that free elections are not currently possible due to the Progressive Party's domination of the media and state institutions.
But this is not one of the students' demands. They are simply calling for the truth behind the Novi Sad disaster to be established.
As law professor Miodrag Jovanovic puts it ""they are asking for the things I've been lecturing about - the rule of law, respect for the constitution, and the responsibility and accountability of public officials"".
Whatever happens during the ""15th for 15"" protest, it seems unlikely that the students will relent until they receive some satisfactory answers.",Europe

BBC News","Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said military planning to protect a potential Ukraine ceasefire is moving to an ""operational phase"" after a virtual meeting with 29 other world leaders.
Military leaders will meet in London on Thursday ""to put strong and robust plans in place to swing in behind a peace deal and guarantee Ukraine's future security"", Sir Keir said.
The meeting follows Ukraine agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire after talks with the US. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he agrees with the idea, but set a number of pre-conditions for peace.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who joined Saturday's meeting, said ""active pressure is needed, not just talks"".
""The world must understand that Russia is the only obstacle preventing peace,"" he said.
""The path to peace must begin unconditionally. If Russia doesn't want this, then strong pressure must be applied until they do. Moscow understands one language,"" Zelensky added.
He urged European countries to produce their own weapons as soon as possible and to talk to the US and its President Donald Trump to reach a deal more quickly through ""full sanctions, strong pressure, and forcing Russia to make peace"".
In a speech after the video call, Sir Keir said ""the world needs actions...not empty words and conditions"".
In a statement, he said the ""Kremlin's dithering and delay"" over the ceasefire proposal and its continued attacks on Ukraine ""run entirely counter to President Putin's stated desire for peace"".
Leaders agreed on Saturday that if Putin refused an ""immediate and unconditional ceasefire"" they would need to ""ratchet up pressure...to convince him to come to the negotiating table"", Sir Keir said.
""To deliver this, we will accelerate our military support, tighten our sanctions on Russia's revenues, and continue to explore all lawful routes to ensure that Russia pays for the damage it has done to Ukraine,"" the statement read.
Putin said on Thursday he supported the idea of a ceasefire, but added ""there are nuances"" and asked a list of questions about details, including whether a ceasefire would allow Ukraine to rearm and who would police it.
Participants in Saturday's call included Nato, the European Union, nearly two dozen European countries, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Military chiefs will meet this week to move forward on ""practical plans"" for how their militaries can support Ukraine, Sir Keir said.
""We will build up Ukraine's own defences and armed forces, and be ready to deploy as a 'coalition of the willing' in the event of a peace deal, to help secure Ukraine on the land, at sea, and in the sky,"" his statement read.
Sir Keir introduced the idea of a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend a ceasefire earlier this month, and on Saturday said it had grown and includes backing from Japan and others.
The prime minister has previously said he is ""ready and willing"" to put UK troops in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal. He has called on other European countries to commit to concrete security guarantees, and said a US ""backstop"" is needed.
In a news conference after the summit, Zelensky said there was a need for some form of ""boots on the ground"" after the ceasefire, although he admitted some were ""sceptical"".
Finnish President Alexander Stubb told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg after the summit that it is ""still too early"" to talk about putting troops on the ground as part of any security guarantee.
Stubb said Finland was willing to be part of efforts to defend a peace deal, but said: ""It is too early to talk about boots on the ground because we don't have a ceasefire, we don't have a peace process. Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments.""
He said there was ""anywhere from zero to 50 different ways they can help out, boots on the ground is only one way"".

Diplomatic correspondent•@BBCPaulAdams","UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says a ""huge amount"" has happened since his ""coalition of the willing"" idea first surfaced at his Lancaster House summit a fortnight ago.
He is not wrong: US-Ukrainian relations have been on a rollercoaster since then, culminating in the meeting in Riyadh earlier this week, where the two sides agreed on a 30-day ceasefire.
But Sir Keir's coalition is a big, still somewhat nebulous undertaking, and there is clearly a great deal of work to be done before this ad hoc alliance is ready to take on something as complex – and potentially perilous – as keeping the peace in Ukraine.
Sir Keir says the coalition is now bigger and that ""new commitments"" are on the table, though he did not spell these out.
Participants of Saturday morning's virtual summit, he said, had agreed to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine and tighten restrictions on the Russian economy, to weaken Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.
Planning, he said, would now move to an ""operational phase"", with military chiefs due to meet in the UK next Thursday.
""Overall, we are successfully gathering political and military momentum,"" he said.
It is likely that we will see a rolling set of political, diplomatic and military gatherings as the plan slowly takes shape.
It is far from plain sailing.
Asked about vital US military support for any European-led operation – what's being called a ""backstop"" – the prime minister was clear: the US position had not changed.
European national security advisors including Jonathan Powell – one of those credited with convincing Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept the US ceasefire proposal – were in Washington on Friday.
Unless US President Donald Trump's position on the backstop changes, Sir Keir's coalition of the willing could struggle to get off the ground.
For Zelensky, the military clock is ticking, especially in Kursk, where his troops have been occupying a shrinking sliver of Russian territory since August 2024.
Ukraine vehemently denies reports that its forces are surrounded in Kursk – a theory promoted by Trump on Friday – but they are clearly under enormous pressure and are losing ground.
When I was in Kyiv towards the end of last year, Ukrainian troops told us they were holding onto territory in Kursk as a bargaining chip to be played in future negotiations.
But as those negotiations approach, it is a chip that Putin seems determined to remove from the table first.
That may go some way towards explaining his ""yes, but"" approach to the idea of a 30-day ceasefire.",Europe

BBC News","US President Donald Trump has praised talks held with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the US-proposed ceasefire deal in Ukraine as ""good and productive"".
This comes after Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff met in Moscow on Thursday evening, after which the Kremlin said it shared the US's ""cautious optimism"" over a peace process.
Trump said in a Truth Social post that the talks provided ""a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end"".
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, accused Putin of trying to drag out talks to continue the war, while Sir Keir Starmer said the Russian president could not be allowed to ""play games"" with ceasefire proposals.
Earlier this week, Ukraine accepted the US-proposed ceasefire deal, which Russia is yet to agree to.
On Thursday, Putin had said the idea of a ceasefire was ""right and we support it... but there are nuances"" and he set out a number of tough conditions for peace, a response branded ""manipulative"" by Zelensky.
Ukraine's leader continued his criticism on Friday in a series of posts on X, writing: ""Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing.
""That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire.""
He said Putin would ""drag"" everyone into ""endless discussions... wasting days, weeks, and months on meaningless talks while his guns continue to kill people"".
""Every condition Putin puts forward is just an attempt to block any diplomacy. This is how Russia works. And we warned about this.""
UK PM Sir Keir said the Kremlin's ""complete disregard"" for Trump's ceasefire proposal demonstrated Putin was ""not serious about peace"".
""If Russia finally comes to the table, then we must be ready to monitor a ceasefire to ensure it is a serious and enduring peace,"" he said.
""If they don't, then we need to strain every sinew to ramp up economic pressure on Russia to secure an end to this war.""
On Saturday, Sir Keir will host a video call with as many as 25 leaders to develop the peacekeeping mission proposed during a summit in London earlier this month.
The ""coalition of the willing"" - as he called it - will work to deter future Russian aggression, should the US-proposed ceasefire come into effect.
In his social media posts on Friday, Zelensky ""strongly"" urged ""everyone who can influence Russia, especially the United States, to take strong steps that can help"", because Putin would not stop the war on his own.
""Putin is lying about the real situation on the battlefield... the casualties"" and ""the true state of his economy"", he said, explaining that Putin was ""doing everything possible to ensure that diplomacy fails"".
But the White House believes the two sides have ""never been this close to peace"".
Talking to reporters, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt maintained that the talks between Putin and Witkoff in Moscow on Thursday were ""productive"".
She added Trump has been ""putting pressure on Putin and the Russians to do the right thing"".
Trump's social media post also ""strongly requested"" Putin should spare the lives of Ukrainian troops, whom he described as surrounded by Russian forces, adding it would be a ""horrible massacre"" not seen since World War Two.
His comments came after Putin said on Thursday that Ukrainian troops in Kursk had been ""isolated"" and were trying to leave, as Russia ramps up efforts to reclaim the region invaded by Ukraine last year.
But on Friday, Ukraine's armed forces general staff denied the encirclement of its troops, calling it ""false and fabricated"".
In a statement, it said operations were continuing, with Ukrainian troops having withdrawn and ""successfully regrouped"" to better defensive positions.
""There is no threat of encirclement of our units,"" it said.
In response to Trump's request, Putin said Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk would be treated with ""dignity in line with the norms of international law and the laws of the Russian Federation"" if they gave up arms and surrendered.
Meanwhile, G7 members have been meeting in Quebec, where host Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said all the members agreed with the US proposal of a ceasefire that is supported by Ukrainians.
""And we are now studying and looking at Russian reactions, so ultimately the ball is now in Russia's court when it comes to Ukraine.""
UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who was also at the meeting, said the members were united in calling for a ceasefire with ""no conditions"".
Following the meeting, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US would not make foreign policy decisions based on what leaders said on social media or at a news conference, and stressed the ""only way to end this war is through a process of negotiations"".",Europe

Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine","Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Vladimir Putin of trying to ""sabotage"" diplomatic efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire.
In a post on social media, he urged the US to put more pressure on the Russian president, saying only the ""strength of America"" could end the war.
The Ukrainian leader said Putin was ""doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire"".
At his press conference on Thursday, Putin said he accepted the idea of a ceasefire but qualified that with numerous questions about detail.
He raised the Kursk border region, where Russian forces are retaking territory occupied by Ukraine six months ago. He accused Ukrainian forces of ""heinous crimes against civilians"" – something Kyiv denies - and asked whether they should walk free or surrender.
He asked about whether Ukraine would use a ceasefire to mobilise, retrain and resupply its troops, without suggesting his forces might do the same.
And Putin raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east. ""Who will be able to determine who violated the potential ceasefire agreement over a distance of 2,000 km and where exactly?"" he asked. ""Who will be held responsible for violating the ceasefire?""
At a meeting with journalists on Friday, Zelensky addressed these issues directly, especially the questions about verification. He said Ukraine was more than able to verify a ceasefire in the air and the sea. But he said the surveillance and intelligence capabilities of American and European aircraft and satellites would be needed to monitor the front line.
Ukraine believes Putin's conditions of detail can be addressed. Much harder to deal with are Putin's objections of principle. He said any deal should ""proceed from the assumption that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis"". By that, he means his objections to the expansion of the Nato military alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign independent state.
There is very little chance of that being addressed in any immediate interim ceasefire. Not for nothing did G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada emphasise Ukraine's territorial integrity ""and its right to exist and its freedom, sovereignty and independence"".
This is why Zelensky said ""Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down"".
So what could happen now? Well the ball is in America's court. President Trump could choose to step up pressure on Russia as Ukraine is demanding. He could impose more sanctions on Russia - and countries buying its cheap oil and gas. He could also give more military and intelligence support to Ukraine. Or alternatively Trump could offer Russia more concessions to get a deal over the line, a possibility that worries some here in Kyiv. Much of the contact between the US and Russia has been held in secret compared to the very public diplomatic pressure imposed on Ukraine.
That is why Zelensky is calling out Russia's delaying tactics and urging the West to put more pressure on Putin. He may also be enjoying seeing Russia in the spotlight, having been the butt of American diplomatic efforts for more than a month since Trump and Putin had their first telephone call.
The bottom line is that Trump has driven a diplomatic bulldozer through many international issues since his inauguration, including the war in Ukraine.
But now he has come up against the walls of the Kremlin and they may be harder to get through.
Trump wants a fast end to the fighting. Putin wants a ""painstaking"" discussion about details and principles. Two incompatible imperatives held by two stubborn leaders used to getting their way. Who will blink first? The prospects of a ceasefire are by no means certain, for all the American expressions of ""cautious optimism"".",Europe

Europe digital editor","Germany's conservative leader, Friedrich Merz, has clinched an enormous financial package to revamp defence and infrastructure, ahead of a crunch vote in parliament next Tuesday.
Merz, who aims to lead a government with the Social Democrats in the coming weeks, is in a rush to push through a big boost in spending on defence and creaking infrastructure.
After winning elections last month, he said it was his absolute priority to strengthen Europe because President Donald Trump appeared indifferent to its fate.
After 10 hours of talks with the Greens, he said the deal sent a clear message to his country's allies: ""Germany is back.""
He added: ""Germany is making its major contribution to defending freedom and peace in Europe.""
Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, is bidding to get his debt and spending reforms through the outgoing parliament before the newly elected MPs are able to take their seats in the Bundestag on 25 March.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party doubled its number of MPs in the election and could jeopardise Merz's spending push if it fails to go through in time. The Left party also objects to the reforms.
Under Germany's constitution, Merz needs a two-thirds majority to get the changes passed. With the support of the Greens and Social Democrats, he should succeed.
Urgent motions by both the AfD and the Left to challenge next week's sessions of the outgoing parliament failed at the constitutional court on Friday, enabling the vote to go ahead.
The conservative Christian Democrat leader said the three-party plan agreed by his party, the Social Democrats and Greens involved:
The defence plans also allow spending on aid for states ""attacked in violation of international law"" to be exempt from the so-called debt-brake.
That would enable outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz to release €3bn in aid to Ukraine as early as next week.
Germany's last government collapsed late in 2024 because of disagreements over loosening debt restrictions brought in by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government during the financial crisis in 2009.
It meant that the government could not borrow more than 0.35% of Germany's gross economic output, while the country's rail and bridge infrastructure creaked from years of underinvestment and ministers tried to boost military spending.
Social Democrat chairman Lars Klingbeil said Friday's agreement sent a ""historical signal"" for Germany that would make the country stronger and ""strengthen Germany's role in Europe too"".
Although the Greens were in the old government, they will not be part of Merz's coalition. However, the party was delighted that the €100bn secured for climate funding would go ""in the right direction"".
Outgoing Greens Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also hailed the defence package as not just making Germany safer but sending ""a clear signal to Ukraine, Europe and the world"".
Germany was taking responsibility in turbulent times, she added.
AfD co-leader Alice Weidel was less impressed, and accused Merz of bending the constitution and loading future generations with a ""gigantic burden"".
""This is nothing less than a financial coup,"" she complained.",Europe

BBC Weather","There has been flooding and landslides in parts of northern Italy as red alerts cover cities including Florence and Pisa.
Torrential rain prompted the alerts for parts of Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna, with heavy and persistent rainfall expected into the afternoon on Friday.
Tuscany's president said local rescue and health services were on high alert and advised residents to exercise ""the utmost attention and caution"".
Almost a month's worth of rain fell in Florence on Friday morning while landslides and mudslides were reported in Bologna, where some residents were evacuated on Thursday evening ahead of heavy rain overnight.
No casualties have so far been reported, and the city said the worst of the flooding had passed by mid-morning on Friday.
A family of four was rescued from a landslide in Badia Prataglia, Tuscany on Thursday evening, according to local media.
The national fire brigade said it had received dozens of calls after the Rimaggio flooded and flowed through the Sesto Fiorentino area on Florence's northern outskirts.
In Pisa, flood defences were being erected along the Arno river as local authorities warned it had surpassed the first flood-risk level.
Roads were also affected by flooding and fallen trees, with residents in Florence advised against all travel after the A1 motorway was partially closed.
Schools were shut in more than 60 municipalities in Tuscany, local media reported, as were several campuses of the University of Florence.
Florence has seen more than double its average March rainfall of 61mm in the past three days.
It saw more than 53mm of rain in just six hours on Friday morning, after a further 36mm had fallen overnight.
The red weather alerts - indicating serious risk of extreme and widespread flooding - were set to continue throughout the day.
Further heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected to move across the northern half of Italy into Saturday, before drier weather begins to move in.
An area of high pressure in the north-east Atlantic has in recent days blocked the path of low pressure systems which normally pass to the north-west of the UK, sending them through the Mediterranean instead.
Some rivers in Emilia-Romagna were already swollen after previous downpours.
More than 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes in the north-eastern region in September 2024 after it was battered by Storm Boris.
The previous year, 13 people died in the region after six months' worth of rainfall fell in a day and a half. Twenty rivers burst their banks and there were some 280 landslides.
The devastating floods brought by Storm Boris were made worse by climate change, scientists at the World Weather Attribution group said.
Europe is the fastest-warming continent - which not only brings much more frequent and intense heatwaves, but also more extreme rainfall.
A hotter world means the atmosphere can hold more moisture, which can lead to heavier rainfall.

BBC News","A Russian national has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Finnish court for committing war crimes in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
Voislav Torden, 38, a senior member of the Russian far-right mercenary group Rusich, was found guilty of four charges by a court in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, on Friday, while he was acquitted of a fifth charge.
The charges relate to an ambush and firefight that occurred in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, which killed 22 Ukrainian soldiers and injured four others. Torden denies the allegations.
It marks the first time charges have been brought and heard in a Finnish court over allegations of war crimes in Ukraine.
Torden, previously known as Yan Petrovsky, was a founding member of Rusich, which operated in the eastern Donbas region as part of pro-Russian separatist fighting against Ukraine. Rusich is a subunit of the Wagner group.
It was alleged that, on 5 September 2014, Torden led his men as part of an ambush of Ukrainian soldiers by pretending to be Ukrainian, before setting fire to a truck and car belonging to the unit.
Twenty-one Ukrainian troops were killed and a further five injured, the indictment said.
The court in Helsinki found there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Rusich was specifically responsible for the ambush, as there were several other groups involved.
However, it found Torden guilty on all other counts, including that he was in charge of the Rusich mercenaries present during the ambush, who killed at least one Ukrainian soldier and injured another.
His men were also found to have mutilated a wounded soldier by ""making the Rusich group symbol on his face"".
Torden was found to have distributed ""degrading"" images of the soldier and to have posted on social media that Rusich would ""not grant mercy"".
A panel of three judges unanimously found him guilty of the latter four charges, writing that the most serious - of killing a soldier - was ""comparable to murder due to its brutality and cruelty"".
While the court held that there was insufficient evidence to find him culpable for the deaths of the 21 other Ukrainian soldiers, it ordered him to pay compensation to the family of the soldier whose death he was found responsible for.
Torden has consistently denied the allegations levelled against him, Finland's public broadcaster reports. He intends to appeal against the conviction, according to national newspaper Ilta-Sanomat.
Torden's lawyer, Heikki Lampela, said the verdict had taken them by surprise.
""There was no evidence that he killed the wounded or gave the order to do so,"" he told Finland's public broadcaster, Yle, adding that Torden was ""equally confused"" he had received a life sentence ""for an act he did not commit"".
Torden was arrested at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in July 2023 at the request of the Ukrainian government, which sought to extradite him.
That request was rejected by Finland's Supreme Court over concerns he would not receive a fair trial in Ukraine - but he was still able to be tried in Helsinki as he was accused of crimes under international law.
Yle reports that similar charges have been tried domestically relating to acts in countries including Rwanda and Iraq.
The office of Ukraine's prosecutor general hailed the court's ruling as a ""key milestone"" in holding perpetrators of ""grave violations of international humanitarian law accountable"".
It added in a statement that Ukrainian officials had ensured that the court had heard from victims and witnesses in Ukraine during the trial, adding that it would continue to work with partners internationally to ""ensure there is no impunity for war criminals"".",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8gn8773no,Legendary Russian composer Gubaidulina dies in Germany,2025-03-14T14:28:03.137Z,"Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor","Legendary avant-garde composer Sofia Gubaidulina has died in Germany, where she spent more than 30 years of her life after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Gubaidulina, who was 93, was one of a group of composers blacklisted in the Soviet Union in 1979.
But her work eventually reached the West, where she was feted for her fusion of modern music with spiritual and religious themes.
She was born in Chistopol in Tatarstan in October 1931 into a Russian-Tatar family.
Her family soon moved to Kazan in southern Russia where she studied music, before moving to the Moscow Conservatoire in 1954.
Although the great Dmitry Shostakovich had already been dismissed from the Conservatoire, his former assistant Nikolai Peïko introduced her to the works of Mahler, Stravinsky and Schoenberg.
Shostakovich soon spotted her talents and told her that she could follow her own ""incorrect path"", however misguided it might seem.
Gubaidulina's compositions were condemned by the Soviet system and her work was banned in the 1960s and 70s.
She was one of three legendary, avant-garde Russian composers to be disgraced, along with Schnittke and Denisov.
""We were all very different artists,"" she told the BBC in 2013. ""Edison Denisov was a classicist with very subtle yet strict logic. Alfred Schnittke was a romantic. My style could be best described as archaic.""
It was only when by chance she shared a taxi in Moscow with violinist Gidon Kremer in the late 1970s that her life changed.
He suggested that she write a violin concerto, and it was this composition, Offertorium, in which she borrowed a theme from Bach, that gave her an international following in the West, after it was premiered by Kremer in Vienna in 1981.
Schnittke praised the work as ""perhaps the most important violin concerto of the 20th Century"".
The Union of Soviet Composers blacklisted her in 1979, condemning her and six fellow composers for writing ""pointlessness... noisy mud instead of musical innovation"".
She was first allowed to travel to the West in 1984, for a festival in Finland.
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Gubaidulina moved to an unassuming house in the quiet village of Appen near Hamburg in northern Germany.
Conductor Sir Simon Rattle spoke of her as a ""flying hermit"", always in orbit and only occasionally visiting Earth.
""It's very tempting to set up rules,"" she once said. ""They very quickly get hopelessly out of date.""",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg70y3ydmdno,Is Putin ready for a ceasefire or playing for time?,2025-03-14T10:05:01.630Z,"Laura Gozzi and Paul Kirby
BBC News","Russia is ready for a halt in fighting, says Vladimir Putin, but ""there are nuances"". Those nuances that he laid out ahead of talks with US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin on Thursday are so key to his thinking they could scupper any hope of a 30-day ceasefire.
They are demands that he has had throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, and before. And for Ukraine and its Western partners, many of them are going to prove unacceptable or impossible to fulfil.
""We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,"" he started positively, only to add: ""This cessation must be such that it would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.""
Nobody would disagree with the need for long-term peace, but Putin's idea of the root causes of the war revolve around Ukraine's desire to exist as a sovereign state, beyond Russia's orbit.
Ukraine wants to be part of Nato and the European Union - so much so, it is enshrined in the constitution.
President Trump has already cast doubt on Nato membership, but Putin has repeatedly dismissed the idea of Ukraine as a state at all.
And that underpins many of the nuances he sketched out.
He wants to stop Ukraine from reinforcing its army and replenishing its weapons supply - so there would be no more deliveries from the West. He wants to know who would ensure that was verified.
From the start of this war, Putin has demanded the ""demilitarisation"" of Ukraine, which is anathema to Kyiv and its allies.
In essence, Putin is looking for security guarantees in reverse.
Would Russia agree to halt rearming or mobilising its forces? That seems implausible and there was no hint of any concession on his part, as he addressed reporters in the Kremlin.
Putin has just come back in bullish mood from a visit seemingly close to the front line in Kursk, a Russian border region that has been partially occupied since last August by Ukraine.
Russia has the upper hand in Kursk. Putin clearly feels he is negotiating from a position of strength and doesn't want to lose it.
""If we stop military actions for 30 days, what does that mean? Will everyone who is there leave the battle?""
Russia's defence ministry announced on Thursday that its forces had now taken full control of the biggest city the Ukrainians had managed to seize, Sudzha. Putin says all the Ukrainians have left is a wedge, so why would Russia stop now?
""If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, no-one will be able to leave at all. There will be only two options – to surrender or die.""
The same applied to the whole of the 1,000km (620-mile) front line, where he claimed the situation on the ground was changing rapidly, with Russian troops ""advancing in practically all areas"".
That is not the case, as most of the front is at a stalemate, even if Russia has had some recent success in the east.
Putin believes a 30-day ceasefire would deprive Russia of its advantage and enable the Ukrainians to regroup and rearm.
""What are our guarantees that nothing like that will be allowed to happen,"" he asked rhetorically.
As yet, no mechanism has been offered to ensure that the terms of any ceasefire would hold.
Although 15 Western countries have tentatively offered peacekeeping troops, they would only come in the event of a final peace deal, not a ceasefire.
Not that Russia would allow that arrangement anyway.
Given all these ""nuances"", Putin appeared to be sceptical of how a ceasefire could benefit Russia, especially when his troops were on the front foot. His entire outlook was ""based on how the situation on the ground develops"".
Putin's spokesman said the Russian leader met Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff later on Thursday evening and provided him with ""additional information"".
Ultimately, the most important conversation for Putin will be with the US president, but Dmitry Peskov spoke of ""grounds for optimism"" for a deal.
""Once Witkoff has given [Trump] all of the information... then we will agree on timings,"" the Kremlin spokesman said of the planned phone-call.
Putin's aim on Thursday was to set out his stall, with a message that the road to a ceasefire was littered with conditions that would be almost impossible to meet.",Europe

Reporting fromKyiv, Ukraine
Gabriela Pomeroy
BBC News","Vladimir Putin has said he agrees with the idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine, but that ""questions"" remain about the nature of a truce - as he set out a number of tough conditions for peace.
The Russian president was responding to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine agreed to earlier this week following talks with the US.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described Putin's response to the plan as ""manipulative"" and called for more sanctions on Russia.
Meanwhile, the US placed further sanctions on Russian oil, gas and banking sectors.
Russian officials said Putin was expected to hold talks on the ceasefire on Thursday evening with US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who had flown to Moscow earlier that day.
It is not clear whether that meeting actually took place. On Friday, Russia's state media quoted the air traffic monitor Flightradar as saying the plane believed to be carrying Witkoff had left Moscow.
Moscow and Washington have not commented on the issue.
Late on Thursday and overnight, both Russia and Ukraine reported new enemy drone attacks.
Ukraine said seven people - including children - were injured in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv.
Russia reported a large fire at an oil facility in the southern city of Tuapse.
Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said of the ceasefire proposal: ""The idea is right - and we support it - but there are questions that we need to discuss.""
A ceasefire should lead to ""an enduring peace and remove the root causes of this crisis"", Putin said.
""We need to negotiate with our American colleagues and partners,"" he said. ""Maybe I'll have a call with Donald Trump.""
Putin added: ""It will be good for the Ukrainian side to achieve a 30-day ceasefire.
""We are in favour of it, but there are nuances.""
One of the areas of contention is Russia's western Kursk region, Putin said, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory.
He claimed Russia was fully back in control of Kursk, and said Ukrainian troops there ""have been isolated"".
""They are trying to leave, but we are in control. Their equipment has been abandoned,"" Putin said.
""There are two options for Ukrainians in Kursk - surrender or die.""
Ukraine's top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said a day earlier that Ukrainian troops would hold defensive positions in the Kursk region ""as long as it is expedient and necessary"" despite ""increased"" pressure from Russian forces.
At Thursday's press conference, Putin also outlined some of his questions over how a ceasefire would work. He asked: ""How will those 30 days be used? For Ukraine to mobilise? Rearm? Train people? Or none of that? Then a question - how will that be controlled?
""Who will give the order to end the fighting? At what cost? Who decides who has broken any possible ceasefire, over 2,000km? All those questions need meticulous work from both sides. Who polices it?""
Putin ""doesn't say no directly"", Zelensky said in his nightly video address, but ""in practice, he's preparing a rejection"".
He added: ""Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, wants to kill Ukrainians.""
The Russian leader had set so many pre-conditions ""that nothing will work out at all"", Zelensky said.
After Putin's remarks and Zelensky's response, there is now a clear divide between both sides' positions.
Ukraine wants a two-stage process: a quick ceasefire and then talks about a longer-term settlement.
Russia believes you cannot separate the two processes and all the issues should be decided in a single deal. Both sides seem content to argue their differences.
Ukraine believes it can put pressure on Russia, painting it as a reluctant peacemaker, playing for time. Russia, equally, believes it has a chance now to raise its fundamental concerns, about Nato expansion and Ukraine's sovereignty.
But this presents a problem for Donald Trump. He has made it clear he wants a quick result, ending the fighting in days.
And right now, Putin does not appear to want to play ball.
Speaking at the White House following Putin's remarks, Trump said he would ""love"" to meet the Russian leader and that he hoped Russia would ""do the right thing"" and agree to the proposed 30-day truce.
""We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia,"" he said.
Speaking earlier at a meeting in the Oval Office with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump told reporters he had already discussed specifics with Ukraine.
""We've been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement,"" Trump said.
""A lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.""
On the subject of Ukraine joining the Nato military alliance, Trump said ""everybody knows what the answer to that is"".
The fresh sanctions on Russian oil and gas came as the Trump administration further restricted access to US payment systems, making it harder for other countries to buy Russian oil.
Earlier in the day, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov rejected the ceasefire proposal put forward by the US.
On Wednesday, the Kremlin released a video it said showed Putin visiting Russia's Kursk region, symbolically dressed in military fatigues. Russia later said it recaptured the key town of Sudzha.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and now controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.
More than 95,000 people fighting for Russia's military have been killed in the war, according to data analysed so far and confirmed by the BBC. The actual death toll is believed to be much higher.
Russia's military has not publicly revealed its battlefield casualties since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had been killed.
Ukraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be underestimated.",Europe

BBC News NI","US tariffs on alcohol from the European Union have the ""potential to be devastating"", the Irish Whiskey Association has warned.
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on all alcohol coming out of the bloc unless a ""nasty 50% tariff on [US] whisky"" is stopped.
It's the latest step in a global trade war, after the EU announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imported in the US on Wednesday.
The body, which is in Washington for St Patrick's Day celebrations, said the escalation was ""extremely concerning"" and that a US-EU trade war puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk.
Irish Whiskey has enjoyed a decade of spectacular growth with global sales more than doubling from 7.3m cases in 2014 to 15.6m in 2023.
The US is by far the biggest export market, taking 5.7m cases in 2023.
That trade is dominated by big brands like Jameson and Powers, but dozens of new craft distilleries have also been targeting the US market.
In a statement, the Irish Whiskey Association said: ""There is no winner in a trade war.
""The imposition of tariffs will impact on our businesses and our consumers.
""Having our sector implicated in this dispute puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk and has the potential to be devastating for Irish Whiskey.""
It called on the EU and US to de-escalate, adding ""the need to remove spirits from this dispute is immediate, and the clock is ticking"".
""We note that there is no tariff currently in place, and now is the time for dialogue,"" the association said.
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin has called for the EU to adopt a ""strategic approach"" to the issue of US tariffs.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the taoiseach said the tariffs were ""very concerning"" for Ireland's spirits industry.
Martin met with Trump in the White House on Wednesday as part of St Patrick's Day events in the US capital.
In the meeting, Trump accused the EU of acting ""very badly"" towards the US and that counter-tariffs create ""ill-will"".
The taoiseach added the only way to resolve a deepening trade dispute between the US and EU is ""through dialogue"".
""Tariffs increase inflation and are not good for the consumer and are not good for business, and that is our view,"" he said.
""But I do believe there will be some distance to go yet. There will be an EU Council towards the end of next week, and again, there will be discussions and consultations within the European Union in respect of European actions.
""And obviously, again, in that scenario, we'll be endeavouring to protect Irish interests in terms of specific Irish products and Irish sectors.""
By John Campbell, BBC News NI business and economics editor
Northern Ireland's unique post-Brexit trading arrangements could give distilleries a way round Trump's threatened tariffs.
Whiskey distilled in Northern Ireland is logically and legally Irish whiskey. But it is exported as a UK product.
That means if the tariffs happen and are applied to the EU, but not the UK, there would be a clear cost advantage for distilleries north of the border.
Bushmills, which is owned by Mexico's Proximo spirits, is the biggest distillery in NI but there are also newer, smaller operations which could see an opportunity.
Earlier, Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn warned there could be an impact for Northern Ireland in any trade war.
He said the introduction of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imported in the US on Wednesday was ""disappointing"".
Speaking at an NI Bureau breakfast event in Washington DC, Benn said he didn't want Northern Ireland to be caught in the middle.
He said tariffs were not really in anybody's interest, and the UK government was working on negotiating a deal with the US.
Benn said he had not had a chance to meet US President Donald Trump yet during his visit to Washington but attended the Speakers' lunch on Wednesday, where Trump gave an address.
Former US congressman Bruce Morrison said that tariffs would be ""bad"" for Northern Ireland and could interfere with the Windsor Framework.
The former Democratic politician believes that the Republican Party has ""lost its nerve"" in supporting Trump in whatever he wants to do.
""I think a lot of what's going on is a bad idea; these are bad things, but 77m people voted for him, so we need to tolerate it,"" he added.
The traditional NI Bureau breakfast is an executive-run event aimed at showcasing Northern Ireland to would-be American investors and celebrating its historical and cultural bonds.
Tariffs are effectively a tax on trade, applied to goods as they enter the country.
The charge is paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.
However, the burden can ultimately fall on the exporting firm if it has to cut its prices or finds that it can no longer compete in that market.
They can be used by governments to protect domestic industries by making competing imports more expensive.
Under the post-Brexit deal known as the Windsor Framework, Northern Ireland is essentially still inside the EU's single market for goods and enforces the EU's customs code.
If tariffs were imposed on the UK they would affect Northern Ireland goods.
But even if the UK avoided US tariffs, the Windsor Framework could have implications for Northern Ireland.
If, for example, the US and EU entered into a tariff war with the EU deciding to put retaliatory tariffs in place, it could lead to a situation where Great Britain is not applying tariffs to US goods, but Northern Ireland is.",Europe

Defence correspondent, BBC News
Reporting fromEastern Ukraine","While Moscow considers a temporary ceasefire, its military machine continues to press its advantage on the front line. Diplomatic negotiations can be slow and difficult. But on the battlefield, they can be measured in lost lives.
At a military hospital in eastern Ukraine, the injured arrive by ambulance in waves. Here, there's an obvious disconnect between diplomacy taking place, far from the fighting, and the brutality of battle – where human bodies are still being smashed, shredded and scarred by bombs and bullets.
We watch another two dozen injured Ukrainian soldiers being loaded on to a bus to be taken to a hospital in Dnipro – some walking wounded, others carried on stretchers. The bus is fitted out with medical equipment to monitor the injured as they're driven fast over potholed roads.
The men on board are the less severely wounded. Most have been hit by shrapnel. The cause is often what's now the most prolific and feared weapon on the front line – drones.
None of those we talked to believe this war will be ending any time soon. Thirty-year-old Maksym is on a stretcher with an IV drip to relieve some of the pain from several shrapnel wounds across his body. He says he'd heard the talk of a temporary 30-day ceasefire, but adds: ""I consider Putin a murderer and murderers don't agree so easily.""
Vova, who's sitting up nearby, says: ""I don't believe it."" He says that near the besieged city of Pokrovsk, they were facing Russian storm attacks every single day. ""I doubt there will be a truce,"" he tells me.
Another soldier named Maksym says this is the second time he has been injured. ""I don't believe there will be a ceasefire,"" he says. ""I had a lot of friends who are not with us any more.
""I would like to believe that all will be good. But you can't trust Russia. Never.""
The large medical bus is operated by Ukraine's Volunteer Army Medical Battalion – known as the Hospitallers. They transport scores of injured soldiers every day.
Sofiia, a 22-year-old medical student, has been working with the team for the last 18 months. She too is sceptical about the chances of a ceasefire: "" I cannot believe it, but I really wish it would happen,"" she says.
She tells me that when she first heard the news that the US and Ukraine had agreed to press for a ceasefire, Russian drones were flying over their base, being engaged by Ukrainian air defences. To her, talk of peace is from a parallel universe.
Sofiia says ""at least it's good that Ukraine and America are talking again"". But as for hopes of any ceasefire, she points to the recent past.
""Looking at all the ceasefire calls that we had in the past, those didn't work. How is this going to work?"" she asks.
Her fellow medic, Daniel, joined the Hospitallers from Sweden. He says he understands what it's like when a smaller nation is attacked by its giant neighbour. His grandfather fought for Finland against Russia during World War Two. History counts.
When Daniel first arrived in Ukraine, he used to ask injured soldiers what they would do after the war. He doesn't any more. ""No-one wants to answer that,"" he says, ""because they don't want to be disappointed. They don't dare to hope.""
Daniel's not ruling out a ceasefire. But he adds: ""You can't trust Putin to do anything that's not beneficial to Putin.""
Ukraine has plenty of bitter experience of negotiating with Russia. France and Germany brokered ceasefires in 2014 and 2015, when Russian-backed forces first took parts of eastern Ukraine and Crimea. They didn't work. Nor did they deter Russia from carrying out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later.
There may be talk of peace, but the men of Ukraine's 68th Jaeger Brigade are still preparing for war. We watch as they rehearse their drills to evacuate an injured soldier under fire. Most have already had to do it for real.
In the distance, we can hear the rumble of artillery. It's just 10 miles to the frontline where they'll soon be returning soon.
They've heard little positive news in recent days. Ukrainian forces are being overrun in Kursk. In August last year, that surprise offensive into Russian territory seemed like a move of tactical brilliance – boosting morale. Now it's in danger of becoming a major strategic setback.
Kursk may soon no longer be a bargaining chip for future negotiations, but a heavy burden, with the loss of prized Ukrainian equipment and life.
One of the few positives is that the US resuming its military support. That matters to the 68th Brigade, who operate American made equipment. They're conducting their drills with a US-supplied MaxxPro armoured vehicle.
Ivan, the driver, who wears a small American patch on his uniform, says he's relieved the Trump administration has now agreed to reverse the block. His vehicle needs regular repairs. ""I would like them to keep helping,"" he says.
But Ivan is still unsure as to whether President Trump can be trusted.
""I have doubts,"" he says. As for trusting President Putin, he replies: ""No. Never."" Here, even a temporary ceasefire feels like a long way off.

BBC News","The number of measles cases in the European region doubled last year to reach the highest level in 25 years, health officials say.
A joint report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's fund, Unicef, said children under the age of five accounted for more than 40% of the cases reported in Europe and central Asia.
""Measles is back, and it's a wake-up call,"" Hans Henri Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said. ""Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security.""
The MMR vaccine - which immunises people against measles, mumps and rubella - is 97% effective in fighting off the dangerous virus.
Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes.
Common symptoms include:
The measles virus can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death.
The WHO/Unicef joint analysis covering 53 countries said there had been 127,350 measles cases reported in the European region in 2024 - the highest since 1997.
A total of 38 deaths had been reported up to 6 March 2025.
Measles cases, they added, had been declining since 1997, but the trend reversed in 2018-19 and cases rose significantly in 2023-24 ""following a backsliding in immunisation coverage during the Covid-19 pandemic"".
""Vaccination rates in many countries are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the risk of outbreaks,"" they warned.
The European region accounted for a third of all measles cases globally in 2024, the joint analysis said. Within that area, Romania had the highest number of cases - 30,692 - followed by Kazakhstan with 28,147.
The WHO/Unicef statement concluded that measles remained ""a significant global threat"" and urged governments where cases were occurring to take quick action - and those where the virus had not arrived to be prepared to act.
There have been two deaths in the US recently as the disease - which was considered ""eliminated"" in the US in 2000 - spreads there and across Canada, too.
Falling vaccination rates have been blamed for the recent flare-up.
In Europe, for instance, eight out of 10 people who were diagnosed with measles in the last year were not vaccinated, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Estimates from 2023 show that only four countries - Hungary, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia - had met the 95% threshold for vaccination to prevent an outbreak, the ECDC said on Tuesday.
Concern has been expressed in the UK, too, over the spread of the disease, as vaccination rates for two doses have fallen below 90%.
Dr Ben Kasstan-Dabush of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine warned people against trusting unverified information on their social media.
""We also learnt from the Covid-19 vaccination programme that misinformation can travel rapidly and can influence people's decisions. It's important to be mindful that the vaccine information on social media may not be based on scientific evidence,"" Dr Kasstan-Dabush said.",Europe

BBC News NI Dublin reporter","The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) seemed puzzled when a member of the White House press corps asked him about Rosie O'Donnell.
Rosie who?
Micheál Martin didn't quite say this, but his instant expression suggested that's what he may have been thinking.
Sitting next to him, the US President Donald Trump had no such doubts.
""Do you know who she is?"", he helpfully asked his guest, before declaring ""You're better off not knowing"".
Mr Martin was in the Oval office for annual St Patrick's Day celebrations hosted by the US President.
Both leaders were taking questions from the media, mostly relating to issues around Irish-American relations, geopolitics, trade, and tariffs.
Then, from left field, came a question about the well-known American comedian and talk show host who is an ardent critic of President Trump.
A US reporter questioned the Taoiseach about Ms O'Donnell's departure from America.
""Why in the world would you let Rosie O'Donnell move to Ireland? I think she's going to lower your happiness levels"", the reporter enquired.
Micheál Martin laughed nervously as President Trump told the reporter ""Thank you, I like that question"".
Up until now, the comedian, writer, and talk show host has not been very well known in Ireland.
That changed after Wednesday's events in the Oval Office, coming just a day after she posted a social media update announcing her move to Ireland.
The president's glee at the question was just the latest barb in a long-running verbal feud between Rosie O'Donnell, Mr Trump, and his MAGA supporters.
In a post on the TikTok social media platform, Ms O'Donnell said she moved to Ireland in mid-January.
She said she has been shown around Dublin and has been travelling around Ireland since her arrival with her twelve-year-old child.
""It's been pretty wonderful, I have to say. The people are so loving and so kind, so welcoming, and I'm very grateful.
""Although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that's what I decided would be the best for myself and my twelve-year-old child, and here we are, here we are"".
She said they are both happy since their move but added, ""I miss my other kids, I miss my friends, I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country"".
She then went on to explain why she decided to leave the United States.
""When, you know, it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that's when we will consider coming back"".
""It's been heartbreaking to see what's been happening politically and hard for me personally as well"".
""The personal is political, as we all know"".
She concluded by wishing her fans well, saying, ""Protect your sanity is all I can say; protect your sanity as much as you can and try not to swim in the chaos, if possible, but I know it's nearly impossible when you're there in the middle of it"".
Ms O'Donnell has also said she is in the process of getting Irish citizenship because she has Irish grandparents.
It is thought she may have relatives in County Donegal where the O'Donnell surname is very popular.
The Irish Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade allows people who were not born in Ireland to apply to become Irish citizens through their Irish-born grandparents.
The process is facilitated through what is known as the Foreign Births Register.
Once a person is entered onto the Foreign Births Register, they are an Irish citizen and entitled to apply for an Irish passport, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.",Europe

BBC News","Germany's foreign intelligence service believed there was a 80-90% chance that coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Chinese lab, German media say.
Two German newspapers say they have uncovered details of an assessment carried out by spy agency BND in 2020 but never published.
The intelligence service had indications that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been carrying out experiments where viruses are modified to become more transmissible to humans for research, they say.
China repeated its denial saying the cause ""should be determined by scientists"" - and pointed to a World Health Organization investigation which found the lab-leak theory was ""extremely unlikely"".
There is no consensus on the cause of the Covid pandemic.
The lab leak hypothesis has been hotly contested by scientists, including many who say there is no definitive evidence to back it up.
But the once controversial theory has been gaining ground among some intelligence agencies - and the BND is the latest to entertain the theory. In January, the US CIA said the coronavirus was ""more likely"" to have leaked from a lab than to have come from animals.
According to Die Zeit and Sueddeutscher Zeitung, the BND met in Berlin in 2020 to look into the origin of coronavirus in an operation called Project Saaremaa.
It assessed the lab theory as ""likely"", although it did not have definitive proof.
The BND also found indications that several violations of safety regulations had occurred at the lab.
The assessment was commissioned by the office of Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor at the time, but was never publicly known of until now.
According to the papers, the findings were shared with the CIA in autumn of last year.
In January this year, the CIA said that a ""research-related origin"" of the pandemic was more likely than a natural origin ""based on the available body of reporting"" - although it cautioned it had ""low confidence"" in this determination.
Both the BND and outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz declined to comment.
China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in response: ""We believe that tracing the origin of Covid-19 is a scientific issue that should be determined by scientists with a scientific approach.
""The conclusion that a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely was reached by the China-WHO joint expert team after on-site visits to relevant labs in Wuhan and in-depth discussions with researchers.
""This authoritative scientific conclusion has been widely recognised by the international community and the scientific community.
""China firmly opposes any form of political manipulation on the issue of Covid-19 origin tracing.""
The WHO investigation in early 2021 saw a team of scientists fly to Wuhan on a mission to look into the source of the pandemic.
After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was ""extremely unlikely"".
But many have since questioned their findings, with one prominent group of scientists criticising the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.
Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis - which was backed in the WHO report - say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or ""intermediary host"".
This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.",Europe

BBC News","Many people in and around the Italian city of Naples have spent the night on the streets and in their cars after an earthquake shook buildings and brought rubble crashing down.
Italian seismologists said the 4.4 magnitude tremor struck at 01:25 local time (00:25 GMT) on Thursday at a shallow depth of 3km (two miles), on the coast between Pozzuoli and Bagnoli.
The quake was felt across Naples and power supplies were disrupted in parts of the city.
Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said that there was ""no evidence"" that an eruption of the nearby Campi Flegrei volcanic crater was imminent.
In Bagnoli, close to the quake's epicentre, a woman was pulled from the rubble of a partially collapsed house with light injuries.
Naples sits on the Campi Flegrei, a volcanic basin that makes the area in southern Italy prone to quakes.
Thursday's earthquake was felt in several areas of the Campania region.
The scale of the tremor was as big as a quake in May 2024, and it was the biggest in the Campi Flegrei (Phlegraean Fields) for 40 years.
It was followed by as many as six weaker aftershocks.
People left their homes and gathered on the streets of Naples, fearing more tremors.
The bell tower of a local church was damaged and several cars had their windscreens smashed.
In Pozzuoli, one resident told Italian TV that residents were concerned that the tremors of the past two years marked a ""different phenomenon from what has happened in the past"".
Along the coast, the mayor of Bacoli, Josi Gerardo Della Ragione, said it had been a difficult night, although his town had not suffered damage.
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was constantly monitoring the situation and was in close contact with her colleagues, her officials said.
Schools elsewhere were closed on Thursday so that building stability checks could be carried out.
The volcanic basin, which is believed to have been created after an eruption tens of thousands of years ago, is home to more than 800,000 people.
Local officials are especially worried by the increased speed of ""bradyseism"" - phases of ground movement that lead to a change in the height of the surface of the land.
Francesca Bianco from INGV told the Ansa news agency that ""the rate of the ground rising has trebled recently, going from 1cm to 3cm per month"".
Edoardo Cosenza, a civil protection councillor in Naples, said on social media that when the speed of bradyseism increased, it was time to respond: ""We know it and we need to know it.""

BBC News","The Queen sent a personal letter of support to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot, Buckingham Palace has confirmed.
Ms Pelicot was drugged and raped by her ex-husband, who also recruited dozens of men to also abuse her, over nearly a decade.
Queen Camilla, a long-standing campaigner on domestic and sexual violence, was said to be ""tremendously affected"" by Ms Pelicot's ordeal and wanted to recognise her ""extraordinary dignity and courage"", Newsweek reports.
In December, judges in the French city of Avignon sentenced 72-year-old Dominique Pelicot to 20 years in prison.
The palace declined to comment on the contents of the letter, which is standard protocol for private correspondence sent from the Queen and other members of the royal family.
But a royal aide told Newsweek despite Ms Pelicot's ""personal suffering"" she had helped ""highlight a very significant societal problem"".
They added: ""It was very much [the Queen's] instigation and determination to write to express support from the highest level.""
Ms Pelicot's case, and France's largest rape trial, brought global attention as she waived her right to anonymity to throw the court's doors open. In her words, she did it to make the ""shame swap sides"" from the victim to the rapist - something which turned the 72-year-old into a figurehead for feminism.
During the trial, groups of women lined up outside court to applaud her strength, sometimes offering flowers.
Her ex-husband's crimes were only uncovered when he was caught taking photographs up women's skirts in a supermarket.
Pelicot filmed the rapes of his wife, collecting hundreds of videos he stored on a hard disk. He stood trial alongside 50 other men.
Of his co-defendants, 46 were found guilty of rape, two were found guilty of attempted rape, and two guilty of sexual assault.
Pelicot was also convicted of taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline, and his daughters-in-law, Aurore and Celine, after photos of them were also discovered on his hard drive.
Dominique and Gisèle's daughter, Caroline Darian, is now pressing charges against her father, accusing him of drugging and raping her.
Ms Darian, 46, says she is clearly unconscious in the two photographs of her found on her father's hard drive.
Pelicot has always denied sexually abusing his daughter.
The Queen has vowed to campaign for victims of domestic violence throughout her lifetime, and has called for a ""culture change"" to stop violence against women.
She has worked with a number of charities and refuges, and supported campaigns through royal visits over a number of years.
In November last year, an ITV documentary followed the Queen's campaign work. In the film, she said domestic abuse should not be a taboo subject, and called for it to be talked about more openly.

BBC News, in Rome
Reporting fromRome","Catholics around the world are marking the 12th anniversary of Pope Francis's election as pontiff by praying for his recovery.
Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, has been in Rome's Gemelli hospital for almost a month. He is being treated for double pneumonia and other infections, and has suffered several respiratory crises, which raised concerns about his survival.
The latest bulletins from the Vatican have said the 88-year-old is stable after a chest X-ray confirmed ""improvements"" in his condition in recent days.
But they said his condition was still complex and that he required further hospital treatment. It is not clear when he will be allowed to leave.
""The clinical condition of the Holy Father has remained stable in the context of an overall complex medical picture,"" according to a statement published by Vatican News.
""The chest X-ray performed [on Tuesday] has radiologically confirmed the improvements observed in the previous days,"" it said.
The Pope has not been seen in public since his admission to hospital and no photographs have been released.
But earlier this month, an audio recording of him speaking in his native Spanish was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City.
His voice, as he thanked the faithful for their rosary prayers for his health, was breathless and weak.
In recent days, the Pope has joined spiritual exercises of prayers and meditation held at the Vatican via video link, without being seen.
In a break with tradition, the Holy See has provided daily updates at Francis's own request.
He has been receiving non-invasive oxygen therapy, administered by nasal tubes during the day and via a mask at night.
His illness has changed the tenor of the way Catholics are celebrating his anniversary.
Cardinal Michael Czerny, a senior Vatican official known to be close to Francis, called the occasion ""a reason for gratitude"".
""This year, his illness makes us especially grateful to God… redoubling our prayers for his full recovery,"" the Cardinal said.
Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, is the first pope from the Americas.
In his native Argentina, churches across the country will hold masses of thanksgiving to mark the anniversary. The services will also include prayers for his health.
Father Claudio, who was visiting St Peter's Square from Angola, said: ""The situation that we find the Holy Father in, that he is so ill, truly it is a very great worry at this moment.""
He added: ""We're praying for the Holy Father that he is returned to full health.""
Arianna, a student from Piacenza in Italy, said she was ""really happy"" that the Pope was getting better.
""I was really upset when I heard he was ill, because he's a very important figure for everyone. I was really concerned about him.""
The Pope, who has been known to work himself to exhaustion, is likely to face a long road to recovery.
There has been speculation that he could choose to follow his predecessor Benedict XVI and resign the papacy. But his friends and biographers have insisted he has no plans to step down.
2025 is a Catholic Holy Year, with 32 million pilgrims expected to come to Rome.
Francis has also been planning at least one foreign trip to Turkey for the celebration of the 1,700th anniversary of a major Christian council of bishops in ancient Nicaea.
Despite his fragile health, he has continued his work from hospital.
""Happy anniversary, Pope Francis,"" the Italian Catholic writer Andrea Tornielli wrote on Vatican News.
""We look with affection and hope at the windows of the 10th floor of Gemelli Hospital,"" he said.
He thanked Pope Francis for ""that still feeble voice of his that has joined the Rosary in St Peter's Square in recent days - a fragile voice that continues to implore peace and not war, dialogue and not oppression, compassion and not indifference.""
""We still need your voice so much,"" he said.",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65wqnyzyxo,Man capturing the sounds of every bird in Ireland,2025-03-13T00:23:03.021Z,"Daniel Logan
BBC News NI","With more than half of Ireland's birds at risk of extinction, an Irish ornithologist is utilising recordings he has made to advocate for their preservation.
Seán Ronayne has approximately 12,000 recordings of Irish birds and other wildlife in his possession.
A documentary team have followed his mission as he attempts to capture recordings of every species of bird in Ireland.
However, Seán believes ""it's not just birds that are at risk of extinction, these are a symptom of something much greater"".
Having been immersed in nature from a young age, Seán Ronayne's project didn't begin until he moved to Spain in 2018.
While living in Barcelona, Seán said he started record birds ""because there were so many new species there"".
""I bought a sound recorder to give myself a chance to figure out what I was listening to and then realised that there was value in sharing the sounds with people,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.
""People reacted to it and I realised that I enjoyed telling their stories.""
Seán, who is from Cobh in County Cork, then returned to Ireland and decided to record ""every bird sound"".
With almost 200 native birds already recorded, he has three species left on his list - the grey partridge, great skua and the red-breasted merganser.
All three are increasingly difficult to locate, he explained.
Seán said the great skua will even attack humans.
""A tough bird, they're seabirds, they wait for other birds to catch food, they chase them down, they attack them and then steal the food from them.""
Even if the bird has swallowed the food, Seán explained, ""they'll attack them until they regurgitate it"".
""They'll even attack you too, if you go near their nesting area.""
The grey partridge, Seán continued, is ""a species that's almost extinct in Ireland"".
""[It's] a ground-nesting species that suffered very much at the hands of the mechanisation of our agricultural practices, remaining in one site in the midlands, in County Offaly.
""Even at that, they're a species that had to be reintroduced, supplemented by birds from Scandinavia.""
When pursuing this amass of birds to add to the portfolio, Seán said in Ireland's landscape he has seen ""destruction and greed"".
The region is ""ecologically devastated"", he said.
However, ""it's not too late"", he added.
""There are fragments of beauty and hope out there, that we can build out from.
""When you go to places outside of Ireland, it really hits home.""
Speaking to BBC News NI from Seattle, Seán said in parts of the US ""it's illegal to cut down a tree"".
""You need to have permission, and when you do cut it down you have to replace it with a mature tree,"" he said.
Irish people ""should be taking example from places like this"", he said.
""63% of Irish birds are at risk of extinction, and that's the canary in the mine.
""It's not just birds that are at risk of extinction, these are a symptom of something much greater.""",Europe

BBC News NI","Ireland is ready to work with the United States to bring ""just, lasting and sustainable peace"" to Ukraine and the Middle East, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said.
The comments come as Micheál Martin presented US President Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks in the White House as part of St Patrick's Day celebrations.
It follows a bilateral meeting between the two leaders where the president raised a ""massive"" trade imbalance with Ireland and accused the European Union of treating the US ""very badly"".
Earlier on Wednesday, the EU announced it will impose counter tariffs on €26bn ($28bn) worth of US goods from next month.
At the shamrock presentation ceremony on Wednesday evening, Martin referenced the US intervention during in the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and its role in the creation of the Good Friday Agreement.
""The story of peace in Ireland is one that we wrote together,"" the taoiseach said.
""We know that building peace is a difficult and painstaking task but when the mighty United States of America puts its shoulder to the wheel, there is no mountain it cannot move.""
Martin also praised Trump's ""unrelenting focus and energy"" in bringing peace to Ukraine and the Middle East.
""In my view, there is nothing more noble than the pursuit of peace and this is what you are doing,"" he added.
In remarks beforehand, President Trump said he ""loves the Irish"".
""We're always going to have that special friendship,"" he said. ""The bond between our nations is as old as our country itself.""
Earlier, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump addressed the ""massive deficit"" with Ireland.
""We want to sort of even that out as nicely as we can, and we'll work together.""
Martin told President Trump that foreign investment is a two-way street, adding that Ireland is ""investing a lot more in America now"".
The EU's move is in retaliation to President Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, which came into effect overnight.
Trump said it had caused ""ill will"".
""The European Union's been very tough, and it's our turn too. We get a turn at that also,"" he said.
""I'm not knocking it, they are doing what they are doing for the EU, but it does create ill will and you know we are going to do reciprocal tariffs,"" he added.
Official figures from Ireland's statistics agency suggest the country had a goods-trade surplus with the US of just over €50bn (£41.6bn) in 2024.
Ireland's goods exports to the US were €72.6bn (£60.4bn) in 2024 while its imports from the US were €22.5bn (£18.7bn).
Trump said that the EU was ""set up in order to take advantage of the United States"".
When asked if Ireland was also taking advantage of the US, Trump said: ""Of course.""
""I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue.""
He added: ""All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasps.
""The Irish are smart, smart people and you took our pharmaceutical companies - and other companies - but you know, through taxation, proper taxation, they made it very, very good for companies to move up there,"" he added.
Trump also said that if he drained Ireland of all the US companies ""maybe I'd lose the Irish vote"".
""We don't want to do anything to hurt Ireland, but we do want fairness and [Martin] understands that,"" he added.
However, Martin said the pharmaceutical companies ""are doing very well in Ireland"", and that there was room to discuss a deal.
""I think there's room for those companies to grow in America and many of them, by the way, have already announced fairly significant manufacturing investments now [in the US],"" the taoiseach added.
Martin said Ireland had served the US companies well with a strong, educated workforce and access to the EU single market.
The president said Ireland's housing crisis was caused by the country ""doing so well"".
Housing availability and cost is a major political and social issue in Ireland, with reports stating thousands of new homes every year are needed to keep up with demand.
""You know why they have a housing crisis? Because they're doing so well, they can't produce houses fast enough,"" Trump said.
Martin added it was a ""good answer"".
However the remark has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with Sinn Féin stating that joking about the housing crisis is ""never a good answer"".
Trump also praised Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy and MMA fighter Conor McGregor during the visit.
He called McIlroy ""talented"", adding he had played a round with him three weeks ago.
The president also complimented McGregor's tattoos: ""He's got the best tattoos I've ever seen"".
After the bilateral meeting, both Trump and Martin travelled to Capitol Hill to attend the Friends of Ireland luncheon hosted by the US House speaker, Mike Johnson.
Addressing the luncheon, Martin said Trump is a ""great friend of Ireland"" and ""we hope to welcome you back to our small island... very soon"".
The United States has been a ""place of welcome and opportunity for Irish people"" for centuries, the taoiseach added.
""Our nation's green has been threaded through the rich tapestry of the United States by almost 32 million Irish-Americans.""
Also speaking at the event, Trump said the ""Irish spirit is truly alive and thriving in America"".
Prior to the meeting, Martin attended a breakfast hosted by Vice-President JD Vance.
Speaking at the breakfast he said that the US ""has been a steadfast friend of Ireland for centuries"".
He said the peace process was a ""signature achievement of US foreign policy"", adding that Ireland is ""ready to play our part in supporting work to end conflict and to secure peace in the Ukraine or in the Middle East or wherever"".
Martin welcomed the ""progress that has clearly been made"" as a result of the Trump administration's ""unrelenting focus and effort"" to secure peace.
Vance described the US-Ireland relationship as ""one of the great alliances and great friendships between nations"".
He added that Ireland is a country with ""incredible community… beautiful landscape and also a lot of interesting technological growth"".
""One of the more robust areas for us to work on with our Irish friends in the years to come is going to be technology and particularly artificial intelligence,"" he said.
The taoiseach was the first EU leader to return to the Oval Office since the president's bust-up with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The bilateral meeting came amid heightened concern over the future of Ireland's economy, which is heavily reliant on US multinationals.
Trump sees this as a trade imbalance and is keen to entice those companies back to the US.
However, Martin said he would use his visit to the Oval Office to highlight an ""increasingly two-way"" trade and investment relationship.
Speaking ahead of Martin's visit to the Oval Office, Democrat member of the House of Representatives Brendan Boyle told BBC News NI's The View that ""what the Trump administration is doing with respect to tariffs makes no economic sense, and it makes no sense in terms of our national security"".
Boyle said that imposing tariffs on Canada suggests that no country is ""safe fully from this sort of madness"", including Ireland.
He added that Martin should ""remind President Trump that Ireland, despite its small size, is one of the largest investors in the United States and one of the largest job creators in the United States"".
""On the one hand, [Trump] likes to say, you know, we're the best, he's the best, He's the greatest. Everything is a superlative.
""But then in the next breath, he says, we're suckers, we're losers, we're being taken advantage of by every other country.""",Europe

BBC News","Police are investigating the fatal shooting of a 71-year-old former mafia boss on a motorway near Grenoble in south-eastern France.
Jean-Pierre Maldera, described by French media as a ""godfather"" of the local mafia in the 1980s, was reportedly chased in his car and shot as he travelled up the A41 motorway on Wednesday morning.
The shooters fled the scene and the burnt-out remains of the stolen Renault Megane car they were driving was found in a Grenoble parking lot shortly after.
His death comes ten years after the disappearance of his younger brother, Robert Maldera, another mafia boss reportedly nicknamed ""the madman"" by members of Grenoble's criminal underworld.
Regional newspaper Le Dauphiné Libéré reported Maldera left the BMW he was driving and attempted to escape on foot across the motorway.
He was chased and killed by the assailants in the attack involving three or four gunmen, local media said.
They are reported to have used a military-grade weapon, such as a Kalashnikov rifle, to carry out the killing.
Maldera is reported to have been a key figure in the so-called ""Italo-Grenoblois"" mafia group during the 1980s and 1990s, along with his brother Robert.
In 2004, the pair were found guilty of a series of offences linked to organised crime, though they were released the following year due to an administrative error, according to the French media.
However, this was not the first time Maldera had been convicted. He had a rap sheet stretching back to the 1970s, according to French regional media outlet France 3.
But Maldera appeared to opt for a quieter life after his release from prison in the early 2000s, with AFP news agency reporting the authorities did not hear of him again until his shooting this week.
It is not clear if Maldera was still involved in criminal activity at the time of his death.
His brother Robert disappeared in 2015 at the age of 55.
He went missing after attending a meeting on the outskirts of Grenoble. His car was discovered two months later in a parking lot nearby.
A source who had investigated the Maldera brothers told France 3 that Jean-Pierre had been the brain behind their schemes, while Robert had been the brawn.",Europe

BBC News","The UK has revoked accreditation for a Russian diplomat and a diplomatic spouse who will need to leave the country, after two British officials were expelled from Russia on Monday.
In the latest in a series of tit-for-tats, the UK Foreign Office said it was taking ""immediate reciprocal action"" after Moscow accused a British diplomat and the spouse of another diplomat of spying
The Foreign Office in a statement accused Russia of fabricating the accusations ""to justify their increasing harassment of UK diplomats"" and ""actively seeking to drive the British Embassy in Moscow towards closure"".
Russia's embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Russia's ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin was summoned by a senior Foreign Office official on Wednesday, the statement read.
The official ""made clear that the UK will not stand for intimidation of British embassy staff and their families,"" and that the accreditation of the Russian diplomat and diplomatic spouse was being revoked as a result.
An accreditation is a recognition by a government of a diplomat's status.
The Foreign Office accused Moscow of pursuing ""an increasingly aggressive and coordinated campaign of harassment against British diplomats"" and ""pumping out malicious and completely baseless accusations about their work"" for 12 months.
The statement alleged Russia was seeking to drive the UK embassy in Moscow to close and Russia had ""no regard for the dangerous escalatory impact of this"".
The UK government believes in ""maintaining diplomatic channels of communication"" with Russia, ""despite the extremely difficult bilateral relations caused by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and long-running campaign of hostile action against the UK"", the statement continued.
The UK's move follows Russia ordering two British officials to leave within two weeks, after the country's domestic security service accused the men of ""intelligence and subversive work"".
The Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed they had declared false information about themselves when receiving permission to enter Russia.
Multiple expulsions of diplomats have taken place amid worsening Russia-UK relations since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
In the past year alone, there have been seven British diplomats expelled from Russia, with Moscow accusing them of espionage - allegations denied by the UK.
In February, a Russian diplomat was expelled from the UK after Moscow ordered a British official to leave in November 2024.
In September 2024, Russia announced that the accreditation of six British diplomats in Moscow had been revoked, requiring them to leave the country.
In May 2024, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia.
It came days after the Russian defence attaché was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an ""undeclared military intelligence officer"".
A number of British politicians and journalists have also been barred from entering Russia since the war began.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was added to Russia's ""stop list"" in 2022, barring his entry to the country.",Europe

BBC News
Vitaliy Shevchenko
Russia editor, BBC Monitoring","It was after 21:00 on Tuesday night in Moscow when the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined the Ukrainian and American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia.
By Wednesday afternoon, the Kremlin appeared to be still weighing its response to the proposals.
Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declined to be drawn into specifics, saying that ""the formation of the position of the Russian Federation [would] take place inside the Russian Federation"".
And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov skirted the issue. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves,"" he said, adding Moscow was ""acquainting itself"" with the joint statement issued in Jeddah.
There are reports that US envoy Steve Witkoff could travel to Moscow on Thursday, and Peskov said the press would be kept informed. Other than this, it was no comment from the Kremlin.
President Vladimir Putin is no doubt thinking carefully about whether to accept the ceasefire proposal, reject it, or demand amendments to it.
The idea of turning down - or amending - the ceasefire proposal seems to be gaining most traction among commentators.
""If [Putin] accepts the US suggestion, it will lead to a dangerous situation,"" pro-Kremlin pundit and former Putin aide Sergei Markov told the BBC, arguing that the Russian army currently has the upper hand on the front line and may lose it.
There are also concerns that Ukraine could use the month-long ceasefire to rearm, so Russia may put forward some conditions, such as demanding an end to the Western supply of weapons to Kyiv.
""The condition should be that during this period, an embargo must be introduced on arms supplies to Ukraine... Europe should support a ceasefire in Europe, not with words, but with actions,"" Mr Markov told Russian media.
If he were to accept the proposal, Mr Markov suggests public opinion could be a factor. Russian society is ""tired of the war"", he told the BBC.
While it is true that some recent surveys show a growing percentage of the Russian population is in favour of carrying out peace talks with Ukraine, it's far from clear that public opinion would have any sway on Putin's decision.
Another potential avenue for Russia would be to accept the ceasefire and then blame any violations on Ukrainian ""provocations"", in the hope of discrediting Kyiv in Trump's eyes.
After Russia seized Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts were made to implement a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. All of them failed.
If this attempt works, it would be unprecedented.
Away from the Kremlin's silence, the announcement of the ceasefire proposal – the most detailed of its kind since the start of Moscow's war on Ukraine – was openly discussed in Russian media.
In some cases, there was jubilation over what they saw as Ukraine folding to US demands, with Komsomolskaya Pravda arguing the White House had ""completely trounced"" Kyiv.
""They heard from Ukraine exactly the words they wanted to hear,"" said the daily.
Still, the overwhelming feeling among many Russian commentators and lawmakers is one of scepticism, particularly in light of the US decision to resume sending Kyiv intelligence and weapons.
MP Viktor Sobolev said a temporary ceasefire would only play into the hands of the Ukrainians as it would allow them to ""regroup in 30 days, replenish their ranks and be replenished with drones"".
There has also been a push to highlight the victories of the Russian army in the Kursk region, parts of which Kyiv has occupied since last summer - and to show Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield.
On Wednesday morning, images of Russian soldiers recapturing Sudzha - the largest town Ukraine managed to seize in Kursk region - were ubiquitous on Russian TV and popular Telegram channels, accompanied by gushing praise for the ""daring"" work of Moscow's troops.
""The real conditions for negotiations are now being created by our heroic guys - all along the front line,"" said daily Moskovsky Komsomolets.
Regardless of the chatter, the final decision – as is always the case in today's Russia – will rest with Vladimir Putin.
He, like Trump, is central to this deal. ""We... do not rule out the need for a telephone conversation at the highest level,"" said Peskov on Wednesday morning – meaning direct contact between the two presidents is on the cards.
Some Russians may believe this is Trump's preferred avenue, too.
""By his own admission, he makes a deal only with the 'boss',"" said state broadcaster Ria Novosti.
""This means that there will be no deals with 'teams', 'representatives' and 'envoys'. A possible deal can only be between Putin and Trump.""",Europe

Senior Royal Correspondent
Vicky Wong
BBC News","The Prince of Wales will make his first visit to Estonia at the end of next week to meet British troops providing a deterrent to Russian aggression in the region.
Prince William will travel in his role as colonel-in-chief of the Mercian Regiment to learn more about how British troops are bolstering Nato's eastern flank, Kensington Palace said.
He will also carry out engagements in Estonia's capital city Tallinn to see how the country, a Nato member, has responded to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and how it is innovating in renewable energy and technology.
News of the visit comes at a pivotal time for the war in Ukraine as the US prepares to present a proposed 30-day ceasefire to Russia.
British forces are deployed to Estonia and Poland under Operation Cabrit, the UK's contribution to Nato's efforts to counter Russian aggression in the Baltic states.
The official visit to Estonia has been planned for several months but it now feels especially timely.
Royal sources see the trip as part of the ""evolution of Prince William as a global statesman"" and describe it as a serious trip for him where ""he is showing his support for the leadership in the UK and the troops we have based at the fringes of Russia"".
Those working with the prince say he is increasingly comfortable in this world of soft diplomacy and believe he has something of value to add.
They cite the role he played when he met US President Donald Trump in Paris in December, and when he represented the UK alongside other global leaders during the commemorations to mark the 80th Anniversary of D-Day last June.
In Estonia, Prince William will be there professionally as a future commander in chief of the Armed Forces and personally as a former soldier.
As ever, it is a delicate, diplomatic line to tread.
While in Estonia, Prince William will meet Ukrainian families displaced by the war.
After his father King Charles met Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky at Sandringham just over a week ago, it is further public support from the royal family for those dealing with the conflict and experiencing its consequences.
King Charles met Zelensky after the Ukrainian president attended a summit of European leaders in London.
Estonia shares a border with Russia and has been a key supporter of Ukraine during the war.
Last month, the country and two other Baltic states - Latvia and Lithuania - unplugged from Russia's electricity grid and joined the European Union's network.",Europe

BBC correspondent
Megan Fisher
BBC News","The UK was ""intimately involved"" in helping Ukraine and the US reach an agreement over a proposed ceasefire deal with Russia, according to UK government sources.
Ukrainian President Zelensky has said he is ready to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire but that it is up to the US to convince Russia to agree, after talks in Saudi Arabia.
The BBC has been told that over the past week there has been a concerted European effort, led by Sir Keir Starmer, to get the US and Ukraine back in good favour with one another.
Sir Keir praised the ""remarkable breakthrough"" and called it an ""important moment for peace in Ukraine"".
Following the announcement, the Trump administration said it would reinstate military aid to Ukraine and restart intelligence-sharing with Kyiv - after abruptly halting this after Donald Trump and Zelensky's row in the Oval Office.
The UK sources say that last week the prime minister's National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, worked with his US counterpart Mike Waltz, and German and French officials, to fashion a plan for a ceasefire and the steps that might follow.
Over the weekend Powell travelled to Kyiv to meet Zelensky and help draft a written proposal which included a temporary pause in fighting, then confidence-building measures such as an exchange of prisoners-of-war, the return of Ukrainian children taken by Russia and the release of civilians.
That proposal was agreed by the Ukrainians and the Americans, setting the stage for what happened in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.
Following the talks between White House and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, Sir Keir congratulated the two men on the agreement, adding ""we now all need to redouble our efforts"" to secure a peace deal for Ukraine.
He said: ""As both American and Ukrainian delegations have said, the ball is now in the Russian court. Russia must now agree to a ceasefire and an end to the fighting too.""
Trump told reporters that US officials would discuss the deal with Moscow either late on Tuesday or Wednesday as he wanted to ""get this show on the road"".
When asked about the 30-day ceasefire proposal, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""let's not get ahead of ourselves"".
Speaking at a daily press briefing, he said Russia was ""carefully studying the statements made after the meeting"" and that the Kremlin needed to be briefed by the US on the outcome of US-Ukrainian talks in Saudi Arabia before commenting on whether a proposed ceasefire was acceptable to Russia.
Peskov did not rule out the need for a phone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Trump.
Labour MP Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Britain has played a ""big part"" in where things currently stand in the war in Ukraine, including proposals for a halt in fighting.
""I think we need to just pause this moment and appreciate the calm and optimism and hope,"" she told the BBC's Today programme.
""We might have peace in Ukraine, this is a step along that road, it could happen and I think we need to at this stage kind of appreciate what it is that we have achieved and I think that Britain has played a big part in that.""
She also said that Powell had ""earnt his money"", noting that the work he has done in helping Ukraine and the US reach an agreement over a proposed ceasefire deal with Russia is an ""achievement"".
On Saturday, Sir Keir will host a phone call of leaders which he has dubbed the ""coalition of the willing"" to discuss peacekeeping efforts aimed at deterring Russian President Putin from launching future incursions into Ukraine.
Those joining the call are ""ready to help bring an end to this war in a just and permanent way that allows Ukraine to enjoy its freedom"", he said.
One aim of the European teams working behind the scenes has been to ensure that it is now Russia that is in the spotlight: does it want peace?
A UK source said ""the ball is firmly in the Russian court. Will they reciprocate and stop the fighting to allow serious negotiations on a lasting peace or will they continue to slaughter innocent civilians?"".
Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, are believed to have been killed or injured on both sides, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees, since Russia invaded Ukraine just over three years ago.
Russia's attacks on Ukraine have continued with Ukrainian authorities confirming one missile attack in President Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih - which killed one person - and an attack on a cargo ship in the port city of Odessa - which killed four Syrian nationals and damaged port infrastructure and grain storage facilities.",Europe

Diplomatic correspondent, BBC News","As US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says, ""the ball is now in Russia's court"". This is a significant moment.
The joint statement from the US and Ukraine, after a long day of talks in Jeddah, contains several key lines, perhaps none more important than this: ""The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.""
We've heard a lot, in recent weeks, about what Donald Trump expects from Ukraine and what sort of blunt instruments the White House has used to bend Kyiv to its will.
Now, it seems, it's time for Russia's intentions to be tested, in public.
Donald Trump's dealings with Vladimir Putin have so far been shrouded in uncertainty, with no obvious sign of pressure to balance that being exerted on Volodymyr Zelensky.
Tuesday's US-Ukrainian statement doesn't imply that Mr Trump has suddenly changed his tune towards Mr Zelensky. Theirs is a thorny relationship, born of many years of mutual mistrust.
But the ugly cloud of acrimony generated by that fractious Oval Office encounter 11 days ago may start to dissipate as the real business of peace-making gets under way.
With the immediate resumption of US intelligence sharing and security assistance to Ukraine, after a suspension that lasted mere days, it's Russia that may now be feeling the pressure.
These are still early days, with a mass of detail to be settled in subsequent negotiations.
The statement speaks of ""substantive details"" on a permanent end to the war and the sort of guarantees Ukraine can expect ""for their long-term security and prosperity"".
But the wording of the last paragraph echoes Washington's view that security and prosperity can be achieved through the conclusion of the much-discussed critical minerals deal, rather than the sort of concrete military assurances Kyiv has been seeking.
Zelensky and Trump, it says, have agreed to strike a deal ""as soon as possible"". How a purely commercial arrangement can prevent hostile Russian action in the future is something that still has to be fleshed out.
The statement also says the Ukrainian delegation ""reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process"", but sheds no light on how Washington views the likely parameters of European involvement.
The meeting in Saudi Arabia feels like a timely reset after the turbulence of recent days. It doesn't mean that the US and Ukraine are fully aligned on the way forward.
If President Zelensky ever had any doubts, he now knows that he's dealing with a capricious, volatile American president for whom past loyalties and traditional diplomatic behaviour mean very little.
He'll do what he can to keep the ball in Russia's court, but he knows there's every chance it could end up back in his.",Europe

BBC News, Lisbon","The government of Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has lost a vote of confidence, almost certainly pitching the country into its third general election in barely three years.
MPs voted against him by 142 to 88 with no abstentions, toppling his right-of-centre minority government.
While Portugal's President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is not obliged to dissolve the assembly, he had made clear that he would if the government lost Tuesday's vote, with fresh elections likely in May.
The confidence motion was tabled by the government itself, after the opposition Socialists announced plans for a parliamentary inquiry into Montenegro's business dealings.
A company called Spinumviva, set up by Luís Montenegro, continued to receive sizeable sums from clients he had previously secured, even after he was elected Social Democratic Party (PSD) president and leader of the opposition in 2022, and had transferred ownership to his wife and two sons.
The legality of the transfer to his wife was questioned by the opposition, given that the marriage is one in which assets are jointly held; the couple have since made their sons sole owners.
But questions remain about the sources of the company's income – which until a few days ago included €4,500 (£3,800) a month from hotels and casino group Solverde, whose gambling concession is up for review – as well as the identity of other clients, which the prime minister has declined to reveal, and the services Spinumviva offers.
The prime minister, a trained lawyer, says the firm provides consultancy services relating to data privacy laws, outsourcing work to external experts – given that his wife is a childminder, one son a student and the other a new graduate.
The Bar Association is now looking into whether the company is illicitly offering services that only lawyers may offer.
In recent days, Montenegro's cabinet has approved a battery of spending and other measures, in what is being seen as a bid to show that it is working hard for the country.
The situation might seem to offer ideal conditions for far-right Chega, the third-largest party in parliament, to renew its attacks on corruption in politics.
Chega also benefited from the resignation of Montenegro's Socialist predecessor, António Costa, who is now president of the European Council. His name had come up in a criminal investigation into government contracts, although he has never been made a suspect.
But in recent weeks, Chega has been hit by scandals of its own, with three of its MPs accused of crimes, including one charged with stealing suitcases at Lisbon airport.
Until recently, Luís Montenegro's coalition with the conservative People's Party was still ahead of the Socialists in the opinion polls, having narrowly won the 2024 general election a year ago.
However, they are now trailing the Socialists, led by Pedro Nuno Santos, who served as a minister under António Costa.
None of the major parties appear keen on a snap election – not least because they fear voters will not be enthusiastic at having to choose a new government when the current one has been in office for less than a year – and the timing is poor in geopolitical terms.
However, Portugal appears set on an unswerving path for May elections.
Not only has the prime minister chosen to appeal to voters rather than face an inquiry, a stance described as ""cowardly"" by the leader of the opposition.
But Pedro Nuno Santos has long pledged not to vote in favour of any government confidence motion.",Europe

In Bucharest and London","Romanian far-right populist Calin Georgescu has lost his appeal against a ruling barring him from participating in May's presidential election.
The Constitutional Court issued the final ruling on Tuesday afternoon after deliberating for two hours. It said the decision was unanimous.
The Central Electoral Bureau had earlier rejected Georgescu's candidacy for a rerun of the presidential election in May.
Georgescu had won the first round of last year's presidential vote, but it was annulled after intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in setting up almost 800 TikTok accounts backing him.
On Sunday, the election bureau said Georgescu's candidacy did not ""meet the conditions of legality"", as he ""violated the very obligation to defend democracy"".
Georgescu appealed that verdict the following day.
In a Facebook video on Tuesday night, Georgescu did not call for further protests - but instead suggested supporters could choose another candidate to back in the re-run election in May.
""If you want to support anyone by signing new lists for the presidential campaign, please do as your conscience tells you,"" he said. ""It seems democracy and freedom are taking their last breath these days.
""But we need to show now, more than any other time, that our choice matters in a peaceful and democratic way,"" Georgescu added.
Earlier in the evening, many of the protesters outside the court had Romanian flags draped around their shoulders. Some held up Orthodox Christian icons and one clutched a large wooden crucifix.
A man dressed in a traditional peasant smock scaled a lamppost with a giant Romanian flag and waved it enthusiastically over the crowd.
They chanted ""Calin Georgescu is president"" and ""freedom"", and condemned the judges as traitors. One woman had a sign that read ""Stop dictatorship"".
It took a while for news of the ruling upholding the ban to reach the crowd. When it did, there were loud ""boos"" directed at the judges inside.
The crowd soon became noisy and angry, saying they had come to the streets to defend democracy.
Calin Georgescu, the man they support, has come from the far-right fringes of Romanian politics, but he is now at the forefront and promises to make Romania great again.
On 26 February, he was detained for questioning on his way to register as a candidate for the May election, prompting tens of thousands of Romanians to take to the streets of Bucharest in protest.
Many Romanians believe he is being blocked by a political elite that is corrupt and remote from the people.
George Simion, an ally of Georgescu and the leader of the far-right opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) wrote on Facebook: ""Shame! You will not defeat us. The people of Romania have awoken. They will win.""
The presidential election was annulled after Georgescu won the first round in November 2024, when intelligence was released suggesting a giant TikTok promotion campaign for Georgescu had been backed by Russia.
To European leaders and many in Romania it looked like Russia was trying to weaken Europe and undermine its liberal values.
That is still the opinion of many Romanians who fear a man who admires Vladimir Putin and dislikes Nato.
The Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that suggestions that Russia had links to Georgescu were ""absolutely baseless"", and protesters out in Bucharest on Tuesday evening called the claims ""fake news"".
""I don't care who you vote for, I just want to be able to vote,"" Anna told the BBC.
Soon after Georgescu's video statement, people began to leave the area.
Several supporters told the BBC they were disappointed more people had not come out in protest.
One man said there should have been hundreds of thousands on the streets.",Europe

Six parties are on the ballot. Five favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.

There are 72 polling stations scattered around Greenland's coast and voting continues until 20:00 (22:00 GMT), with results expected early on Wednesday.

No two towns are connected by road or rail, and the island is exposed to extreme Arctic weather.
Back in 2018, the 55 residents of Savissivik in northern Greenland never received their ballots due to inclement weather, according to Danish reports. So an Air Greenland base manager on his 4x4 and a local hunter on dog sled joined forces to deliver the ballots on time.
Planes, helicopters, ships, speedboats, cars, snowmobiles and dog sleds are routinely employed to ensure ballots reach all corners of the country before the election.
When the polls close, stations send their results in by email to Greenland's five municipalities to be added to the tally.
At the last parliamentary election in Greenland in 2021, the voter turnout was 65.9%.
The state of the healthcare system, social issues, fisheries and the economy have all been discussed over the course of the electoral campaign.
But it is the question of Greenland's independence from Denmark which has dominated the debate.
Although it now semi-autonomous, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark – nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away – for about 300 years.
Naleraq - currently the largest opposition party - has gained momentum and promises to hold a snap vote on independence within three to four years.
Other parties are more careful and have avoided giving exact timelines.
Severing ties with Denmark would be a big blow to Greenland's economy, which depends on the fisheries sector. Danish subsidies currently contribute more than $565m (£435m) a year - a fifth of its total economic output or GDP.
""At the moment, [Greenland] is not ready for independence,"" the director of the Bank of Greenland Martin Kviesgaard told Danish media on the eve of the election. ""It will take many years to become completely ready for it, if you are talking about becoming financially self-sufficient... Fishing is not enough.""
Past colonial wrongdoings have meant that Denmark has largely kept out of the independence debate.
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly said it is for Greenlanders to decide their future.
The US president first floated the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, towards the end of his first term in office.
However, since the start of this year, he has expressed interest in acquiring the Arctic island with increasing frequency, to the alarm of many in Greenland as well as Denmark.
In January, Trump's son Donald Jr. visited Greenland on what he said was a ""personal day-trip"" but which sparked real nervousness that the Trumps' interest was not just fleeting.
Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US.
It also has a large American space facility and reserves of valuable minerals which have so far proved hard to exploit.
Last week, Trump told the US Congress ""we're going to get [Greenland] - one way or the other"".
The president's shadow has therefore loomed large over this election.
At the final candidates' debate on Sunday night, five out of six party leaders said they did not believe the US president could be trusted.
If Greenland does eventually choose independence from Denmark, it would then have the freedom to pursue closer ties and become far more exposed to US interest.
So it is unsurprising that in January Donald Trump reposted a 2019 poll that indicated 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark.
Trump's comments on Greenland caused barely concealed panic in Copenhagen earlier this year.
Mette Frederiksen spent much of January holding crisis talks with her government as well as other Scandinavian and European leaders. She also spoke to Trump on the phone on more than one occasion.
The frantic diplomacy has cooled in recent weeks as Ukraine and other global issues took centre stage in Washington.
But as Greenlanders voted on Tuesday, Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen made an oblique reference to President Trump, saying that ""major powers have a different interest in Greenland than they have had before"".
Of course it was important, he added diplomatically, ""that Greenland elects some steadfast politicians to lead the country through it"".",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89y8gn2w8vo,Sweden says Russia is greatest threat to its security,2025-03-11T14:28:49.392Z,"Aleks Phillips & Paulin Kola
BBC News","Russia poses the greatest threat to Sweden due to its aggressive attitude towards the West, the Scandinavian nation's security service Sapo has said.
It wrote in its annual report that while Sweden joining the Nato military alliance had strengthened its security, it had also led to increased Russian intelligence activity. Russia denies any wrongdoing.
Sapo also said that the security situation in Sweden was serious - with foreign powers operating in more threatening ways, with hybrid warfare, alongside incidents of violent extremism.
Charlotte von Essen, the head of Sapo, said there was a ""tangible risk that the security situation can deteriorate further"" in a way that may be hard to predict.
Sweden became a Nato member last year, seeing it as the best guarantee against Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
That January, its civil defence minister warned ""there could be war in Sweden"" in the near future due to Russian aggression.
Sapo said on Tuesday that Russia's intelligence activities were primarily aimed at undermining cohesion between Nato members, counteracting Western support for Ukraine, and circumventing sanctions.
It said these activities showed Russia was becoming ""increasingly offensive and risk-prone"" in the face of a build-up of Swedish, and wider European, defences.
""When gathering intelligence, the Russian security and intelligence services use a wide range of resources and different platforms,"" the agency wrote, adding that these activities had been limited by expelling intelligence officers.
Ms von Essen said Swedes needed to be vigilant about ""widespread anti-state narratives and conspiracy theories"" that seek to act as a destabilising force, adding that it was ""important that we do not normalise the new situation"".
In its report, Sapo mentioned suspicious incidents involving infrastructure and which countries may have been behind them ""in some cases"".
A series of undersea cables and gas pipelines have been damaged in suspected attacks since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting Nato to launch a monitoring mission in the sea.
The latest such breach was reported last month near Gotland - Sweden's largest island.
Russia denies any involvement in efforts to interfere with countries' democratic systems or of seeking to sabotage their economies.
The Swedish government also identified Iran and China as posing significant security threats to the Nordic country.
Last year, Sapo accused Iranian intelligence of hacking into a text messaging service to send 15,000 messages to Swedes, after several Quran burnings. Iran calls any such allegations ""baseless"".
Sapo's 2025 report said foreign intelligence threats included cyber-attacks, technology theft and tracking the movement of foreign dissidents living in Sweden - the latter two allegedly carried out by China. Beijing also denies any such involvement.
Sapo also said the threat of terrorism remains high, but was diversifying to not just include ""ideologically motivated actors"", but also violence instigated by a foreign power and young people with a fascination with violence who have been radicalised online.
Ms von Essen said that Sapo had seen examples of nations including Russia and Iran inducing individuals, often young people, to carry out acts of violence.
Serious attacks have occurred in France, Germany and Austria, the Sapo chief said.
Sweden itself was dealing with the aftermath of ""the terrible incident in Orebro"", she noted, referring to Sweden's worst mass shooting last month, in which a gunman attacked an education centre in central Sweden, killing nine people.
Sapo said violent Islamist extremism and violent right-wing terrorism remained prominent threats.
Sweden remains on high alert for terrorism - with the threat level assessed at four out of a five-point scale.",Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlxe4wxxj4o,Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins,2025-03-24T09:29:48.505Z,"Nadine Yousif & Jessica Murphy
BBC News, Toronto","Canada's newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney has called a snap election, sending the country to the polls on 28 April.
The election comes as Canada faces a trade war with the US and calls from President Donald Trump for it to become the 51st American state, issues which are expected to be top of mind for voters.
It also comes nine days after Carney, a Liberal, was sworn in as Canada's prime minister following Justin Trudeau's resignation.
Carney must now face Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party had been leading in national polls since mid-2023, though recent polls suggest the race is now neck-and-neck.
The two main candidates held their first rallies on Sunday. In St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Carney addressed the threat of US tariffs, repeating a favoured sporting analogy: ""In this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win.""
Speaking in Ottawa earlier that day, Carney said he needed a clear, positive mandate to deal with Trump.
""We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,"" he said.
In a rally of his own in Toronto on Sunday evening, Poilievre said Carney's party was failing to offer change, and simply ""making the same promises that they've been breaking for over 10 years"".
The Liberals – once written off for this election - now have a chance of forming a government for the fourth consecutive time under Carney.
Carney, 60, the former governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, has never served as an MP and is untested politically.
Carney made the most of his short days in office, meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron and stopping in Canada's Arctic to announce a partnership with Australia to develop a new northern radar system.
He also ended Trudeau's signature carbon tax climate policy, which had faced heavy criticism by the Conservatives.
Now he will face the general electorate, which is concerned about Canada's rapidly shifting relationship with the US, its historically close ally, as well as the country's high cost of living.
In a campaign launch shortly before the election call, Poilievre, 45, sought to link Carney to the Liberals under Trudeau, who left office as a deeply unpopular leader. He called Trudeau's time in office a ""lost Liberal decade"".
He accused the party of weakening the country by blocking resource development, failing to fund the military, and mismanaging immigration and the economy, saying its ""post-national globalist ideology"" made Canada more vulnerable to Trump's trade war.
President Trump's current and threatened tariffs on Canadian goods could usher in economic instability in the country and push Canada towards a recession.
Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods on 2 March before partially pausing them for a month. On 12 March, a blanket 25% duty on all aluminium and steel imports went into effect, hitting Canadian importers.
The Trump administration plans further global tariffs on 2 April, in the campaign's second week.
Canada has retaliated so far with tariffs on about C$60bn ($42bn; £32bn) worth of US goods.
Carney on Sunday called the trade war with the US one of the ""most significant threats of our lifetimes"".
Referring to Trump, he said: ""He wants to break us so America will own us. We will not let that happen.""
Carney has promised further retaliation, though he has conceded there is a limit to Canada's tariff response given the different size of the two economies.
Poilievre said that Canada must respond firmly to threats from the White House.
""We have to convert our anger and our anxiety into action,"" he said. ""We have to become strong, self-reliant and sovereign to stand up to the Americans.""
The campaign will last just five weeks - the shortest allowed. Besides the US-Canada relationship, much of the focus will be on the economy, including cost-of-living issues.
In the Canadian federal election, voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. Instead, the leader of the party with the most members of parliament traditionally becomes PM.
Four main parties will contest the election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Québécois, who only run candidates in the French-speaking province of Quebec with a focus on their regional interests.
The Green Party and the People's Party of Canada are also in the running.
NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said on Sunday that neither Carney nor Poilievre are the right choices for Canada, accusing them of protecting the wealthy, not ordinary Canadians.
""You deserve a prime minister you can trust to make decisions in your best interest,"" he said.
The Bloc is facing pressure from a surge of support for the Liberals in Quebec.
Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet pitched his party as a voice for industries in Trump's sights - from aluminium to dairy and lumber - that are all significant in the province.
The Greens for the first time are running with co-leaders: Jonathan Pedneault and Elizabeth May.
""We must vote now as though our country depends on it, because more than ever before, it does,"" said Pedneault on Sunday.
At dissolution of Parliament at the time the election was called, the Liberals held 153 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats. The Bloc had 33 seats, the NDP had 24 and the Green Party held two.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07zxy98g45o,Five things to look for in Canada's election,2025-03-24T01:44:49.284Z,"Jessica Murphy
BBC News, Toronto","Canada's general election campaign is under way, a 36-day sprint taking place in unprecedented circumstances.
Voters will consider which party should govern the country just as the US - its neighbour and largest economic partner - launches a trade war and President Donald Trump muses about making Canada the 51st US state.
Domestic issues like housing and immigration will still be important, of course, but for the first time in decades, Canadians will also be grappling with fundamental questions about the country's future when they head to the ballot box on 28 April.
Here are five things to watch as the campaign unfolds.
Canada and the US share deeply integrated economies, a long-standing security partnership and the longest ""undefended"" border in the world.
So when President Donald Trump says he wants to use ""economic force"" against America's neighbour, calls the border an ""artificially drawn line"" and imposes steep tariffs, it marks a profound shift in the relationship between the two allies.
""It is impossible to overstate the impact of the president's actions on Canadian politics, on Canadian psyche, on Canadian business,"" said Marci Surkes, chief strategy officer at public affairs firm Compass Rose and a former policy director to ex-prime minister Justin Trudeau, a Liberal.
Trump's interventions have already reshaped politics in Canada, helping transform what seemed like a certain Conservative victory into a too-close-to-call battle with the Liberals.
And on Sunday, as campaigning began, all the party leaders focused their launch messages heavily on the US threats.
What the US president says and does over the next few weeks will inevitably factor into the race. On April 2, for example, in just the second week of campaigning, the White House is expected to announce more global tariffs.
He has already started to make his views on the election known, telling Fox News host Laura Ingraham on 18 March that Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is ""stupidly, no friend of mine"" and that it may be ""easier to deal actually with a Liberal"".
Ultimately, he added, who wins ""doesn't matter to me at all"".
Canadians know their next PM will have no choice but to deal with Donald Trump.
So the question on many voters' minds is: who can most capably handle the unpredictable US president?
The contest essentially boils down to the new Liberal leader Mark Carney and Poilievre, who has led the Conservatives since 2022.
Two other major parties will be contesting seats in Parliament - the left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) and the the Bloc Québécois - but Canadians have historically elected Conservative or Liberal governments.
Carney, 60, is a former central banker who is new to politics - after taking over from Justin Trudeau earlier this month, he became the first prime minister in Canada never elected to Parliament.
He brings experience on the world stage - he governed the Bank of England from 2013-2020 - but lacks time spent in the cut and thrust of political campaigning, and will get his first real test in this general election.
If the Liberals fail to win the election, he could have the shortest tenure of any PM in the country's history.
At 45, Poilievre may be significantly younger, but he is a political veteran. First elected to the House of Commons at age 25, he has two decades of experience in federal politics, including time in cabinet, and is known for his political acumen.
As party leader, he was quick to highlight the pain that inflation was inflicting on Canadian families, and capitalise on broader anger at Trudeau and the Liberals on issues like immigration.
His tag line ""Canada is broken"" has in recent weeks become ""Canada first"". The shift in message from a country in decline to one of patriotism and strength comes as he presents himself as able to stand up to Trump.
He is ""the consummate retail politician"", Ms Surkes said, but ""suffers from having - right now - a brand and a narrative that no longer fits the moment"".
It will be the first time in decades that a Canadian election is not focused mostly on domestic issues.
Instead, this election is about the big, national questions: Canada's sovereignty and what the country must do to face an uncertain future with uncertain allies.
Ms Surkes compared the situation to the 1988 elecftion, when Canada's relationship with the US also took centre stage as the country mulled joining the North American Free Trade Agreement.
""The same types of questions were being asked in terms of whether there would be a forfeiture of Canadian sovereignty, economic sovereignty, economic independence,"" she said.
This time, both main parties are pushing a vision of growth and independence - building much-needed housing, moving forward on major energy and resource projects, retaliating against US tariffs and bolstering Canada's defence capabilities.
So where are the differences?
Carney has moved the Liberals more towards the political centre as he seeks to distance himself from Trudeau, who left office deeply unpopular.
He has promised to ""spend less and invest more"" and to boost capital investments in things like housing, and military infrastructure and computing resources.
Poilievre, a fiscal hawk, pitches cutting red tape and taxes to boost industry and spur infrastructure investment and home building.
The Conservatives have also focused more sharply on issues like crime.
The core domestic concerns that Canadians have had in recent years - affordability, housing, healthcare - haven't gone away.
But pollster David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, says they have been subsumed by the ""existential threat"" of the trade war with the US.
""Even if the cost of living is still the top issue, it may not be as powerful a motivator to drive voting behavior,"" he adds.
So the parties will be challenged to come up with convincing policies to address these concerns - but frame them in the context of the wider economic threat.
The US tariffs, the uncertainty caused by their on-again-off-again nature, and Canada's C$60bn in counter-tariffs, are already being felt by businesses and communities across the country.
This week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development more than halved its economic growth outlook for Canada this year and next.
National opinion polls have seen a stunning reversal in recent weeks, with the Conservatives losing the 20-point lead they had over the Liberals for the better part of a year.
As the race officially begins, it's a toss-up.
Mr Coletto said three factors led to the ""perfect storm"" in polling: the resignation of the deeply unpopular Trudeau, the Liberal leadership race which that sparked, and the return of Donald Trump to the White House.
Both candidates now are trying to ""bring their enemies to the battlefield"" to eke out an advantage, he added. Carney is seeking to paint Poilievre as ""Trump-light"", while Poilievre suggests Carney is ""just like Justin"".
Each campaign enjoys natural advantages, he says.
The Conservatives have ""an animated base who desperately want a change in government"", along with a well-funded political machine.
The Liberals currently ""have the advantage on narrative"" that has helped shift the polls more in their favour.
The other two official parties - the NDP and the Bloc - have both seen their popularity diminish.
The left-leaning NDP, which had 24 seats in the last Parliament, helped prop up the Liberal minority government in recent years in exchange for support for progressive policies like dental care for low-income Canadians.
But leader Jagmeet Singh has been pushing hard against Carney, seeking to frame him as someone who will ""protect billionaires and big business"".
Bloc leader Blanchet said on Sunday he would fight for Quebec companies and workers struggling under US tariffs, especially in the aluminium industry.

North America Technology correspondent•@lilyjamali
Reporting fromSan Francisco","Popular DNA testing firm 23andMe has filed for bankruptcy protection, and announced that its co-founder and CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has resigned with immediate effect.
The company will now attempt to sell itself under the supervision of a court.
23andMe said in a press release that it plans to continue operating throughout the sale process and that there ""are no changes to the way the company stores, manages, or protects customer data.""
On Friday, the Attorney General in 23andMe's home state of California issued a consumer alert advising customers to delete their data from the site given the company's ""reported financial distress.""
23andMe's saliva-based test kits were once celebrated among customers and investors, who helped to push the company's value as high as $6bn (£4.6bn).
But it has been struggling for survival.
Founded in 2006, the company went public in 2021 but has never turned a profit.
In September, the firm settled a lawsuit alleging that it failed to protect the privacy of nearly seven million customers whose personal information was exposed in a 2023 data breach.
In some cases, hackers gained access to family trees, birth years and geographic locations, by using customers' old passwords. The data stolen did not include DNA records, according to the company.
Two months after the settlement, it cut 200 employees, amounting to 40% of its workforce.
23andMe said its finance chief, Joe Selsavage, will take over as interim chief executive.
Ms Wojcicki will continue to serve as a member of the board.
She had tried to take the company private but was not open to a third-party takeover.
23andMe - which once had high-profile endorsements from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria, and Snoop Dogg - struggled to redefine its business model.
Customers did not have much to return for once they had paid for a DNA report, and an effort to launch a subscription service proved unsuccessful.
Efforts to use its massive trove of data to move into drug development also faltered.
All of the company's directors, except for Ms Wojcicki resigned last summer, saying in a letter they were quitting after not receiving a satisfactory buyout offer from her.
In its statement on Sunday, 23AndMe's board chair Mark Jensen said the company is ""committed to continuing to safeguard customer data and being transparent about the management of user data going forward"".
He said it would be ""an important consideration in any potential transaction"".
But this may not ease concerns of some users about what happens to the DNA they shared with the company.
In the UK, it is considered special category data under data protection laws.
This provides legal protections if a firm goes bust or changes hands.
When a DNA testing company called Atlas Biomed appeared to have ceased trading last year, some customers were left with more questions than answers about what it meant for them.
Prof Carissa Veliz - author of Privacy is Power - previously told the BBC it is arguably the most valuable personal data you have.
""If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,"" she said.

""Look, I'm not stepping down,"" Schumer told NBC News' Meet the Press programme on Sunday.
Some Democrats wanted Schumer to block the most recent government funding bill, which they believed enabled President Donald Trump's agenda, but Schumer decided to allow a full vote.
He and a handful of other Senate Democrats voted to advance the measure to a final vote, but voted against the funding bill's ultimate passage.
Schumer told Meet the Press he made his decisions ""out of pure conviction as to what a leader should do and what the right thing for America and my party was"".
The Senate's top Democrat argued that blocking the bill would have caused the government to shut down, a scenario that would have handed Trump increased power to slash federal jobs and social and public services.
The government funding measure was ""certainly bad,"" Schumer said. ""But a shutdown would be 15 or 20 times worse.""
Yet many powerful members of his party have openly criticised Schumer's decision, arguing he threw away their limited leverage against Trump.
Schumer's decision has publicly exposed a rift in the Democratic Party about how they should oppose the Trump administration.
""I myself don't give away anything for nothing,"" former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at an event in San Francisco last week. ""I think that's what happened the other day.""
Pelosi speculated that Schumer could have tried to get Republicans to agree to a ""third way.""
""They may not have agreed to it, but at least the public would have seen they're not agreeing to it,"" Pelosi said. She acknowledged such pushback could have resulted in a government shutdown.
Speaking to ABC News, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent, said he believed the issue was with the Democratic Party writ large.
He alleged the party was ""dominated by billionaires"" and was ""out of touch"" with its constituents.
Democratic voters have voiced their frustration with their party's leadership in recent town halls held throughout the country.
""When will you be calling for [Schumer] to be replaced as minority leader?"" a constituent asked Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, at a recent town hall.
At the end of his response, Bennet said: ""And in dodging your question, let me just say, it's important for people to know when it's time to go... We're going to have conversations, I'm sure, in the foreseeable future, about all the Democratic leadership.""",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l2evgny6o,Who's who in Canada's federal election,2025-03-23T17:08:37.702Z,"Nadine Yousif
BBC News, Toronto","Prime Minister and Liberal leader Mark Carney has called an election in Canada, kickstarting five weeks of campaigning before Canadians head to the polls.
Voting day will officially be on Monday 28 April.
It will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are neck-and-neck in the polls, making it a race to watch.
While Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.
Here is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.
Carney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few days.
His party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.
For many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.
He was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics.
Carney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.
But Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec.
Recent polls show his party is slightly trailing behind the Conservatives, but more Canadians say they think Carney would be a better prime minister than his opponent Pierre Poilievre.
Poilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.
Since then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.
He is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their ""disastrous"" and ""woke"" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to ""common sense politics"" if his party were to form government.
It is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.
But the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.
Poilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the ""51st state"".
Poilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put ""Canada first.""
Trump himself has said that Poilievre is not ""MAGA enough"", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.
The Bloc Québécois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.
Still, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.
Blanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.
""It's enough jibber-jabber,"" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. ""We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.""
He has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: ""I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.""
On domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.
Blanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will ""come roaring back"" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.
Polling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament - have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.
Singh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.
In 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.
The NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.
But in late 2024, Singh tore up that ""supply and confidence"" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.
At the time, Singh had said that the Liberals ""let people down"" and didn't ""deserve another chance from Canadians"".
But his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 9% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-March, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen.
A big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status.
In the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.

""In the midst of a celebration of her life and an avalanche of happy memories, Mia quietly slipped the bands of mortality and, as her words and vision always did, soared heavenward,"" the family statement, which was posted on X, said.
Paying tributes to Love, Utah Governor Spencer Cox wrote: ""A true trailblazer and visionary leader, Mia inspired countless Utahns through her courage, grace, and unwavering belief in the American dream.
""Her legacy leaves a lasting, positive impact on our state. We will miss her deeply.""
Mia Love's political career formally started in 2003 when she won a seat on the Saratoga Springs' city council, and she later became the mayor, aged 34.
In 2014, she was elected to the US House of Representatives. The daughter of Haitian immigrants, she made history as the first Black Republican woman to take up the role, and served two terms.
Her re-election bid four years later ended in a razor-thin defeat to her Democratic rival Ben McAdams.
Love was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a fast-moving and aggressive form of brain cancer, in 2022 and was given 10-15 months to live - which she surpassed.
Her death comes nearly two weeks after Love wrote an opinion piece for Deseret News, which she said was ""not to say goodbye but to say thank you and express my living wish for you and the America I know"".",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rk62znm3yo,The Indian scholar arrested in US over Palestinian sympathies,2025-03-24T10:40:34.355Z,"Neyaz Farooquee
BBC News, Delhi","It was an invitation from a classmate 15 years ago that changed the life of the Indian scholar, who is now facing deportation from the US over terror charges.
On that summer evening, Badar Khan Suri had been sitting outside his department at Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia university when a classmate announced that an international aid convoy was set to go to Gaza - the Palestinian territory run by the armed Islamist group Hamas and under blockade by Israel.
To students of conflict studies, the caravan - of more than 150 people from several Asian countries - offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness one of the world's most contentious disputes up close.
Mr Suri happily agreed to participate, a classmate recalled to the BBC.
It was during this trip that he met Mapheze Saleh, a Palestinian and the daughter of a former Hamas adviser, whom he married a few months later.
After living in Delhi for almost a decade, the couple moved to the US where Mr Suri joined the prestigious Georgetown University as a postdoctoral fellow.
He had been living in Virginia for nearly three years when the police knocked on his door on the evening of 17 March and arrested him.
Three days later, on 20 March, Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, tweeted that Mr Suri was being detained for his ""close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, a senior adviser to Hamas"". He has denied the allegations.
This action follows President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants and activists involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests which authorities have accused of fuelling antisemitism and supporting Hamas. The group is designated a terrorist organisation by the US. India, however, has not banned Hamas.
Although Mr Suri, who entered the US legally on a student visa, has had his deportation blocked by a US court, the terror allegations have shocked those who know him back home.
His acquaintances describe him as a soft-spoken, shy and hardworking student with a broad knowledge of the world, while his classmates and teachers said they found allegations of him having ties with Hamas ""tenuous"".
India has historically supported the Palestinian cause. But it has also developed close, strategic ties with Israel in recent years, with Delhi often refraining from criticising Israel's actions.
Even then, ""by no stretch of imagination can Suri be associated with anything unlawful"", one of his professors from Jamia told the BBC.
""Having a view on the ongoing conflict is not a crime. As a conflict studies scholar, it is well within his professional mandate to share his analysis of the war in Gaza.""
Those who accompanied him on the trip held similar views.
Feroze Mithiborwala, one of the organisers of the caravan, remembered Mr Suri as an intelligent, young man.
""He always took a secular stance in our discussions. He was not some right-wing Islamist type of character,"" he said.
The trip began in December 2010 from Delhi. As India's neighbour Pakistan refused to give a travel permit to the group, the convoy had to travel to Iran, Turkey, Syria and Egypt before finally reaching Gaza.
The route, most of which was covered by bus, offered much for a student of peace and conflict studies, one of Mr Suri's friends who also went on the tour said.
Throughout the trip, he was deeply moved by the sufferings he witnessed in Gaza and focussed on providing aid to the widowed and elderly, he added.
The caravan, in many ways, ""brought Mr Suri closer to the Palestinian cause"", but his interest was largely academic, said another classmate who was in touch with him until days before his arrest.
The second and the last time Mr Suri went to Gaza was for his own wedding with Ms Saleh.
A US citizen, Ms Saleh had been working as a translator and volunteer in Gaza at that time.
Her father, who has lived in the US, is a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement submitted by her in court.
In 2010, he left the Gaza government and ""started the House of Wisdom in 2011 to encourage peace and conflict resolution in Gaza"", it adds.
When Ms Saleh and Mr Suri first met, they did not speak much. But they connected again a few months later, a friend who accompanied him on the caravan told the BBC.
Their wedding made headlines in India, as the couple moved back to Delhi and continued to live there for about eight years.
Ms Saleh enrolled herself for a masters degree in Jamia and later worked at the Qatar embassy. In 2023, Mr Suri moved to the US and Ms Saleh followed him.
He was months away from completing his fellowship when he was arrested.
Mr Suri's father said it pained him to see his son in this situation.
""He has no connections with Hamas or Palestine [other than his marriage]. His sin is that he is married to a Palestinian woman,"" he said.
But he is hopeful that his son will not be deported. ""After all, these are merely allegations. There is no proof of any wrongdoing,"" he added.

BBC News","Columbia University has agreed to several demands from the Trump administration after $400m (£310m) in federal funding was pulled over accusations the university failed to fight antisemitism on campus.
Columbia says face masks used for the purpose of concealing identity are no longer allowed, and anyone involved in a protest must, when asked, present university identification.
Friday's memo from the university comes after the Trump administration gave Columbia a list of nine items that were required before it would reconsider the $400m in funding.
Columbia has agreed to much of the demands, but the Trump administration is yet to respond and it is unclear if the funding will be restored.
""Our response to the government agencies outlines the substantive work we've been doing over the last academic year to advance our mission, ensure uninterrupted academic activities, and make every student, faculty, and staff member safe and welcome on our campus,"" Interim President Katrina Armstrong told students in an email on Friday.
A change that will impact academics at Columbia is the shift in its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department. A new official will now lead that department.
""In this role, the Senior Vice Provost will review the educational programs to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,"" the memo read.
Columbia says the role will ""conduct a thorough review of the portfolio of programs in regional areas across the University, starting immediately with the Middle East"".
The university will also review admission procedures to ""ensure unbiased admission processes"".
Earlier this month, the Trump administration said the reason for funding being pulled at Columbia was because of alleged ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students"".
When the $400m was pulled, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said: ""Universities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding"".
The Trump administration had requested masks be banned on Columbia campuses, and to allow university police to arrest ""agitators"" - if negotiations about federal funding were to continue.
It is not only Columbia that has faced funding cuts, the Trump administration has warned 60 universities that funding may be cancelled if allegations of antisemitism on campuses are not addressed.
This all comes in the wake of a high-profile arrest of one of Columbia's students. Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate and campus activist, was detained by federal immigration authorities earlier this month.
Mr Khalil, a legal permanent US resident, faces deportation for his role in the 2024 campus protests.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly alleged that Mr Khalil, and other pro-Palestinian activists, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US.
The 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of ""open repression of student activism and political speech"".",US & Canada

BBC News","Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has told the BBC she believes Canada can win the trade war which was sparked by a series of tariffs ordered by US President Donald Trump.
""We are the biggest customer of the US,"" Joly told the BBC's World Service Weekend programme. ""We buy more from the Americans than China, Japan, the UK and France combined.""
Joly said tariffs and increased prices are a priority for Canadians as voters prepare to head to the polls to elect a new prime minister later this year.
The US president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada. Trump has also vowed to impose a sweeping range of ""reciprocal"" tariffs on 2 April.
Joly said that because the US and Canadian economies are so intertwined, ""we have the most leverage in the world when it comes to the US"".
She noted it is not just Canadians feeling the pain from tariffs, but ""hardworking Americans"" too.
But Joly said it could be Americans who are the most successful in urging an end to the trade war.
""We think that ultimately the only ones that will be able to help us win this war... are the Americans themselves because they're the ones that can send a message to their lawmakers,"" she told the BBC.
""We can win the hearts and minds of Americans, because ultimately they're the ones paying for this"" she added, noting that both American and Canadian jobs are at risk because of the tariffs.
The trade war is expected to be at the forefront of Canadians' minds when they head to the polls.
Reports suggest Prime Minister Carney could call for a snap election on Sunday. That election is expected to be held on 28 April.
And it is not just the Liberals making the case against US tariffs, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has also been on the trade war. He has argued he is best equipped to take on Trump.
""There is no good reason to do this to these good people,"" Poilievre said earlier this week. ""Stop the tariffs, stop the chaos.""
Trump has vowed to impose further tariffs Canada, and other countries around the world, on 2 April - calling these tariffs ""the big one"".
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has promised to impose reciprocal tariffs if Trump's tariff threats come to fruition.
It will bring to head a weeks-long back and forth between the North American countries.
The frustration over trade war has led some Canadians to start protesting.
In Toronto on Saturday, Canadians held an ""elbows up"" protest to push back against President Trump's stated desire of making Canada the 51st state of the US, and the ongoing trade war.
The phrase, used in hockey to describe defending oneself or fighting back, has been repurposed by protesters in Canada.
In the BBC World Service Weekend interview, Joly was also asked about the upcoming federal election.
She said the Liberal party is ""very keen"" to make sure Canadians give the party ""a clear mandate"" to deal with Trump and the threat of tariffs.
Joly said Canadians are ""preoccupied"" by what is happening in the White House and they are looking for a prime minister who has ""strong values"".
The race will likely come down to a choice between Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.
Tariffs are a central part of Trump's overall economic vision.
He says tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, raising tax revenue and growing the domestic economy.
He also wants to restore America's trade balance with its foreign partners - reducing the gap that exists between how much the US imports from and exports to individual countries.
But he has refused to rule out the prospect of a recession as a result of his trade policies, which sent US stocks sharply down in the days before the metal tariffs took effect.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later said the tariffs were ""worth it"" even if they did lead to an economic downturn.
Trump's tariffs initially targeted goods from China, Mexico and Canada.
These accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US in 2024.
But Trump has accused the three countries of not doing enough to end the flow of migrants and illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the US.

BBC News","Orlando police have recovered two sets of earrings worth a combined $769,500 (£597,000) after an alleged thief swallowed them more than two weeks ago.
Jaythan Gilder, 32, swallowed the Tiffany & Co. diamond earrings around the time he was taken into custody on 26 February, police said.
Mr Gilder was monitored by detectives at an Orlando hospital for ""more than a dozen days"" before the earrings were expelled from his system, according to the Orlando Police Department.
Mr Gilder faces charges of robbery with a mask and grand theft in the first degree.
Tiffany's has since cleaned the earrings.
Police allege Mr Gilder posed as an assistant to an NBA player so he could be shown ""very high-end jewellery"" in a VIP room at a Tiffany & Co. store in Orlando, Florida on 26 February.
Mr Gilder allegedly distracted store employees, then ran from the store with two pairs of earrings. The suspect apparently also dropped a diamond ring valued at $587,000 as he fled the store.
When officers caught up with him later that day, they saw Mr Gilder ""swallowing several objects believed to be the stolen earrings,"" police said.
Officials transporting Mr Gilder to jail allegedly heard him say, ""I should have thrown them out the window,"" CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported.
At the jail, Mr Gilder allegedly asked staff, ""Am I going to be charged with what's in my stomach?""
Police later released an x-ray that appeared to show an individual's abdomen with a foreign object inside.
Orlando police department said they took Mr Gilder to an area hospital and monitored him for about two weeks until the earrings were recovered.
Detective Aaron Goss said the case ""quickly turned into a marathon, not a sprint"".
On 12 March, police said they recovered the fourth Tiffany & Co. earring.
When the earrings were brought back to the Tiffany's, the store's master jeweller confirmed that serial numbers on the jewellery matched the stolen pieces, Mr Goss said.
Gilder is currently in custody at the Orange County Jail.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg8ez8201yo,Heavyweight boxing legend George Foreman dies aged 76,2025-03-22T08:06:34.865Z,"Christal Hayes
BBC News, Los Angeles","Boxing heavyweight legend George Foreman has died aged 76.
Known as Big George in the ring, the American built one of the most remarkable and enduring careers in the sport, winning Olympic gold in 1968 and claiming the world heavyweight title twice, 21 years apart - the second making him the oldest champion in history aged 45.
He lost his first title to Muhammad Ali in their famous Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974. But overall, he boasted an astonishing total of 76 wins including 68 knockouts, almost double that of Ali.
Foreman retired in 1997 but not before he agreed to put his name to a best-selling grill - a decision that went on to bring him fortunes that dwarfed his boxing earnings.
His family said in a post on Instagram on Friday night: ""Our hearts are broken. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.""
The statement added: ""A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family.""
Tributes poured in from others across the sport, with former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson saying Foreman's ""contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten"".
The Ring magazine, often dubbed the Bible of Boxing, described him as ""one of the greatest heavyweights of all time"".
""[He] will be remembered as an icon of the sport forever.""
Foreman was born in Marshall, Texas, on 10 January 1949, and raised along with six siblings by a single mother in the segregated American South.
He dropped out of school and turned to street robberies before eventually finding his outlet in the ring.
Foreman won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, aged 19, before turning pro and winning 37 consecutive matches. He lost only five bouts over his career.
He beat previously undefeated reigning champion Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973 knocking him down six times in the first two rounds.
His 1974 Rumble in the Jungle against Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, remains one of the most famous boxing matches ever.
Ali, the older man, was the underdog after he was stripped of his crown seven years earlier for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War.
Foreman reflected on the legendary fight 50 years later in an October interview with BBC World Service Newshour, explaining that everyone thought he was going to decimate Ali.
""Oh, he's not going to last one round,"" the boxer said experts were predicting at the time.
Foreman told the BBC he typically would get ""real nervous"" and have ""butterflies"" before any boxing match, but that night - it was the ""most comfortable"" he had felt.
But the wily Ali used a tactic that later became known as ""rope-a-dope"", which wore out Foreman, causing him to throw out hundreds of punches before Ali unloaded on him in the eighth round and scored a knockout.
After a second professional loss, Foreman retired in 1977 and became an ordained minister at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Texas, which he founded and built.
He told the BBC his defeat to Ali became the ""best thing that ever happened to me"" as it ultimately led him to ""get my message out"" through preaching.
He recalled that his preaching started small, on street corners and with friends, then grew.
""We began meeting informally at various homes in Houston, and before long, the crowds became too large for most houses to accommodate,"" Foreman said on his website.
""Eventually, we bought a piece of land and an old, dilapidated building on the north-east side of Houston.""
Foreman came out of retirement in 1987 to raise money for a youth centre he founded. He won 24 matches before losing to Evander Holyfield after 12 rounds in 1991.
In 1994, Foreman knocked out undefeated Michael Moorer to become the oldest ever heavyweight champion at age 45.
He became ad pitchman for his George Foreman Grill, which millions have purchased since it hit the market in 1994, thanks in part to his memorable catchphrase, the ""Lean Mean Grilling Machine"".
Foreman was married five times. He has a dozen children, including five sons who are all named George.
He explained on his website that he named them after himself so they ""they would always have something in common"".
""I say to them, 'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together,"" he explained. ""And if one goes down, we all go down together!'""",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewk49j7j1po,The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk,2025-03-23T01:04:10.501Z,"Lara Lewington, Liv McMahon & Tom Gerken
BBC News","Having a chip in your brain that can translate your thoughts into computer commands may sound like science fiction - but it is a reality for Noland Arbaugh.
In January 2024 - eight years after he was paralysed - the 30-year-old became the first person to get such a device from the US neurotechnology firm, Neuralink.
It was not the first such chip - a handful of other companies have also developed and implanted them - but Noland's inevitably attracts more attention because of Neuralink's founder: Elon Musk.
But Noland says the important thing is neither him nor Musk - but the science.
He told the BBC he knew the risks of what he was doing - but ""good or bad, whatever may be, I would be helping"".
""If everything worked out, then I could help being a participant of Neuralink,"" he said.
""If something terrible happened, I knew they would learn from it.""
Noland, who is from Arizona, was paralysed below the shoulders in a diving accident in 2016.
His injuries were so severe he feared he might not be able to study, work or even play games again.
""You just have no control, no privacy, and it's hard,"" he said.
""You have to learn that you have to rely on other people for everything.""
The Neuralink chip looks to restore a fraction of his previous independence, by allowing him to control a computer with his mind.
It is what is known as a brain computer interface (BCI) - which works by detecting the tiny electrical impulses generated when humans think about moving, and translating these into digital command, such as moving a cursor on a screen.
It is a complex subject that scientists have been working on for several decades.
Inevitably, Elon Musk's involvement in the field has catapulted the tech - and Noland Arbaugh - into the headlines.
It's helped Neuralink attract lots of investment - as well as scrutiny over the safety and significance of what is an extremely invasive procedure.
When Noland's implant was announced, experts hailed it as a ""significant milestone"", while also cautioning that it would take time to really assess - especially given Musk's adeptness at ""generating publicity for his company.""
Musk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: ""Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.""
In reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic.
""I think he was just as excited as I was to get started,"" he said.
Nonetheless, he stresses that Neuralink is about more than its owner, and claims he does not consider it ""an Elon Musk device"".
Whether the rest of the world sees it that way - especially given his increasingly controversial role in the US government - remains to be seen.
But there is no questioning the impact the device has had on Noland's life.
When Noland awoke from the surgery which installed the device, he said he was initially able to control a cursor on a screen by thinking about wiggling his fingers.
""Honestly I didn't know what to expect - it sounds so sci-fi,"" he said.
But after seeing his neurons spike on a screen - all the while surrounded by excited Neuralink employees - he said ""it all sort of sunk in"" that he could control his computer with just his thoughts.
And - even better - over time his ability to use the implant has grown to the point he can now play chess and video games.
""I grew up playing games,"" he said - adding it was something he ""had to let go of"" when he became disabled.
""Now I'm beating my friends at games, which really shouldn't be possible but it is.""
Noland is a powerful demonstration of the tech's potential to change lives - but there may be drawbacks too.
""One of the main problems is privacy,"" said Anil Seth, Professor of Neuroscience, University of Sussex.
""So if we are exporting our brain activity [...] then we are kind of allowing access to not just what we do but potentially what we think, what we believe and what we feel,"" he told the BBC.
""Once you've got access to stuff inside your head, there really is no other barrier to personal privacy left.""
But these aren't concerns for Noland - instead he wants to see the chips go further in terms of what they can do.
He told the BBC he hoped the device could eventually allow him to control his wheelchair, or even a futuristic humanoid robot.
Even with the tech in its current, more limited state, it hasn't all been smooth sailing though.
At one point, an issue with the device caused him to lose control of his computer altogether, when it partially disconnected from his brain.
""That was really upsetting to say the least,"" he said.
""I didn't know if I would be able to use Neuralink ever again.""
The connection was repaired - and subsequently improved - when engineers adjusted the software, but it highlighted a concern frequently voiced by experts over the technology's limitations.
Neuralink is just one of many companies exploring how to digitally tap into our brain power.
Synchron is one such firm, which says its Stentrode device aimed at helping people with motor neurone disease requires a less invasive surgery to implant.
Rather than requiring open brain surgery, it is installed into a person's jugular vein in their neck, then moved up to their brain through a blood vessel.
Like Neuralink, the device ultimately connects to the motor region of the brain.
""It picks up when someone is thinking of tapping or not tapping their finger,"" said chief technology officer Riki Bannerjee.
""By being able to pick up those differences it can create what we call a digital motor output.""
That output is then turned into computer signals, where it is currently being used by 10 people.
One such person, who did not want his last name to be used, told the BBC he was the first person in the world to use the device with Apple's Vision Pro headset.
Mark said this has allowed him to virtually holiday in far-flung locations - from standing in waterfalls in Australia to strolling across mountains in New Zealand.
""I can see down the road in the future a world where this technology could really, really make a difference for someone that has this or any paralysis,"" he said.
But for Noland there is one caveat with his Neuralink chip - he agreed to be part of a study which installed it for six years, after which point the future is less clear.
Whatever happens to him, he believes his experience may be merely scratching the surface of what might one day become a reality.
""We know so little about the brain and this is allowing us to learn so much more,"" he said.

BBC News","When Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed help for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.
Rebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol syndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised educational support. His symptoms could include aggression towards peers, faculty or objects, and he received suspensions last fall following outbursts.
Rebecca said the school district isolated her son from his peers for months, with only special education teachers and limited faculty for contact.
In October 2024, Rebecca filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights alleging the school violated federal disability law and her son had been ""discriminated against and denied a free appropriate public education"". She alleged the school only allowed him to ""attend school for two hours per school day and in a 1:1 segregated setting"". Hours were gradually added back, Rebecca said, but he remained isolated. The school district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Though Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, an OCR lawyer in the Cleveland office was facilitating mediation with the school district as soon as April.
But before that could happen, the Trump administration fired the Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son, throwing her case - and others like it - into limbo.
""I don't have any other option for this kid,"" said Rebecca, who asked the BBC to withhold her last name and her son's name to protect his privacy. ""They're playing politics with my little boy. And I don't think that's fair.""
The sudden firings, and ensuing confusion, were precursors of President Donald Trump's next big move: to try and dismantle the Department of Education entirely.
On Thursday, he signed an executive order that directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin to ""facilitate the closure"" of the department. Congress, not the president, actually holds the power to dismantle a federal agency, and the order will likely spark legal challenges.
But the move has left many Americans like Rebecca uncertain about their children's future.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told media on Thursday that while the department will not be shut down completely, what will remain will be much smaller, and will focus on ""critical functions,"" such as federal student loans.
OCR, she said, will be greatly reduced in ""scale and the size"".
Cuts have already begun: On 11 March, the Trump administration made drastic cuts to the department using a process known as a reduction in force, halving its staff.
McMahon said the downsizing showed a ""commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.""
Although the Department of Education has little oversight over the day to day operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing federal education guidelines and policies.
The Office for Civil Rights was one of the hardest hit divisions in that first round of firings. The administration shuttered 7 of the 12 regional offices, including major metropolitan areas like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco.
This month, as Rebecca and her husband tried to figure out what the changes at the department meant for their son's case, the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office received an email that their unit was ""being abolished"" – along with their positions.
The news left one Cleveland attorney who works on disability cases with a ""complete feeling of desperation.""
The attorney worried not only about the individual cases still underway, they told the BBC.
""The effect of each individual case is sometimes much bigger, in terms of educating the school and making good for the others in the district,"" said the attorney, who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the administration.
Parents and OCR attorneys had long been frustrated with the agency's growing backlog and diminishing staff. They fear new cuts will make it impossible for the already overwhelmed division to handle the tens of thousands of complaints it receives each year.
Tasked with making sure schools are following America's civil rights laws, the OCR's job is to help ensure that students are not discriminated against because of their disability, sex, race or religion. Remedies the office helps institute could be as straightforward as adding accessibility features to school buildings or seating a near-sighted child at the front of the class. But the office also tackles complex cases involving discrimination or bullying, as well as sexual harassment and assault.
Before his executive order, there were already signs that the office's mission was changing.
OCR staff had received guidance for the office to prioritise cases involving antisemitisim, the AP reported. Craig Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, has said they will take on cases involving transgender athletes at universities in order to combat ""radical transgender ideology"".
On 14 March, the Department of Education said it had launched investigations into more than 50 universities as part of the administration's move to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, which it views as exclusionary.
Staffers who remained in their jobs said the Department of Education's new leadership had provided little to no guidance about how thousands of pending cases, including Rebecca's, would be reassigned. They also worried that cases involving racial minorities, or people with disabilities, will not receive the appropriate attention.
The office received a record 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, according to OCR's annual report. Headcount had declined even as cases increased over the years. In 1981, OCR had 1,100 full time employees. By 2024, it was down to 588.
""We were already so incredibly flooded with cases,"" the Cleveland attorney said. ""I was never proud of our processing time.""
With the new cuts, they said, ""this work will not be able to be done"".
But parents and educators say they will not let the Department of Education be shut down without a fight.
Nikki Carter, a mother and disability advocate in Alabama, is one of two plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, which is suing the Department of Education, McMahon, and Trainor over the mass job cuts.
She was already familiar with the frustration of OCR's backlog. Her own case, filed in December 2022 during the Biden administration, dragged on with sporadic updates.
The lawsuit alleges that McMahon's actions have stalled Ms Carter's racial discrimination case that was being handled by the OCR and she ""has received no indication that the investigation has resumed"".
""There was a lack of communication throughout the entirety of the process,"" Ms Carter told the BBC. ""When the Trump administration came in, it made that situation even worse and even more difficult.""
Despite her frustrations with OCR, she believed the office was still necessary to help victims of racial discrimination. She hoped the lawsuit would not only restore the office, but improve it.
""Children, family, as well as advocates, they don't get due process,"" Ms Carter said. ""They are being denied just basic federal educational rights. And so when you can't get that on the local and state level, the only hope that we have is to turn to the federal government.
""We do need OCR to go back to work,"" she said. ""And we also need OCR to be accountable for their actions – or lack thereof.""
Meanwhile, Rebecca has transferred her son to a district school for students with emotional impairments. But she still wants OCR to negotiate special tutoring for her son, and to educate the district staff about how to help students like him. She recently learned her son's case would transfer to the still-operating Denver office, but has received no other updates.
""He was treated so poorly and differently because of the way his brain was structured,"" she said. ""I want to see somebody held accountable for the way he was treated.""",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg80x2rw58o,Trump's move to dismantle education department was a conservative dream for decades,2025-03-20T22:09:03.704Z,"Bernd Debusmann Jr
BBC News, Washington","As he strode into Congress for his State of the Union speech in 1982, US President Ronald Reagan was prepared to deliver a message that resonated with many Republicans: let's end the Department of Education.
""We must cut out non-essential government spending,"" Reagan told lawmakers, vowing to cull the wider federal workforce by 75,000.
For 43 years, that vision for abolishing the education department - backed by members chafing at ""big government"" control over state issues - went unrealised.
But now, Donald Trump is attempting just that, through an executive order that instructs his Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take ""all necessary steps"" to shutter the department and ""return education authority to the states"", according to a White House-provided fact sheet.
Trump has already moved to lay off half of the agency's workforce. While closing the department outright would require an act of Congress, a political longshot, the president can take steps to break up the department and narrow its remit.
If ultimately successful, he would fulfil a campaign promise and long-running policy that has united disparate groups within the Republican Party, ranging from establishment Republicans and evangelical Christians to the Make America Great Again wing of the party that is most aligned with Trump.
Trump's executive order cites a number of reasons for dismantling the department, including $3tn (£2.3tn) spent ""without improving student achievement"", plummeting test scores, excessive ""ideological initiatives"" and a return of control to the states ""where it belongs"".
Jonathan Butcher, an education policy veteran with experience in South Carolina, Arkansas and Arizona, told the BBC that these reasons, broadly, are ones shared by various factions of the Republican Party - and have been for years.
""Reagan correctly saw the philosophical and practical point that when you create an agency in Washington, it only grows in size and assumes additional responsibilities,"" said Mr Butcher, now a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has long called for the abolition of the department.
""And sure enough, that's what the US Department of Education has done,"" he added.
While the first US Department of Education was established by President Andrew Johnson in the wake of the American Civil War in 1867, it soon shrank and faded into relative obscurity, housed under various names and agencies.
Over a century later, the now-cabinet level department was revived under Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1979 - immediately drawing the ire of Republicans such as Reagan.
During his victorious campaign to become president, Reagan described the department as a ""new bureaucratic boondoggle"" that allowed Washington, rather than ""local needs and preferences"", to determine how American children were to be educated.
Similar arguments were made by Republicans during subsequent administrations, although a lack of congressional support long made efforts to dismantle or eliminate the agency impossible.
""I do not believe we need a federal department of homework checkers,"" then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich told the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in 1995.
Gingrich, who was one of only a small number of Republican lawmakers to support the department's original creation, added that it had become a ""massive disappointment"".
While many of the same arguments are being made today, some experts point to heightened ""culture wars"" - a hallmark of US politics in recent years - as having breathed new life into efforts to scuttle the department.
""What I think is so unifying for the right is that there was always a sense that it offered a kind of one-stop access for the education 'blob' to influence policy,"" said Frederick Hess, director of education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, another Washington-based think tank. ""That has been part of the critique going back to Reagan.""
""But the department had never been as forcefully involved in ferocious national culture battles,"" Mr Hess added.
""While there are a lot of reasons those on the right might want to see the department downsized or abolished... this has given it all a new energy and focus that has really changed it from a talking point and given it another level of import.""
Experts, however, warn that there remains significant misunderstanding of what the department actually does, and the federal government's power to influence educational outcomes.
Unlike the UK's Department for Education, for example, its US counterpart takes no part in laying out national curricula, which it leaves to the states. It contributes only a small fraction of funding for student spending when compared to state-level counterparts.
It does, however, administer student loan programmes and Pell grants that help low-income students attend university - which the White House says that it will continue to do even once largely dismantled.
Mr Hess, for his part, compared the department to a ""McGuffin"" - a plot device famously used by Alfred Hitchcock to develop a character's plot arc, while at the same time being largely irrelevant.
""There absolutely is an enormous amount of red-tape and regulation that gets in the way of schools, abolishing the department doesn't get rid of that red tape and regulation,"" he said. ""These are baked into law.""
As an example, Mr Hess pointed to programmes such as Pell grants or Title I, a federal initiative to provide funding to schools with large numbers of low-income students.
""Even if you downsize the department, all of those requirements are still in place. You need to actively shave down the requirements and regulations or re-write the law in order to make a significant difference,"" Mr Hess said.
Already, the Trump administration's efforts to slash the size of the department have been the subject of lawsuits, and the new executive order has already faced fierce criticism from Democratic lawmakers who say it endangers student education and jeapordises school funding and financial aid.
The truth, Mr Hess said, is likely somewhere in the middle of the opposing sides.
""Both sides are, for different reasons, overstating the importance of downsizing or abolishing the department, and neither side is paying as much attention to the stuff that would really fundamentally change federal education,"" he added.
But for those supportive of the move, Trump's efforts are the fulfilment of a campaign promise.
""On the campaign trail, he [Trump] said it was a priority for states, not the federal government,"" said Mr Butcher of the Heritage Foundation .
""While a move towards efficiency and streamlining, it would really do more for state's autonomy... it's a much deeper issue than a financial one.""",US & Canada

BBC Mundo in Venezuela
Bernd Debusmann Jr
BBC News, Washington DC","In a poor neighbourhood of the Venezuelan city of Maracay, the mother of 24-year-old Francisco José García Casique was waiting for him on Saturday.
It had been 18 months since he had migrated to the US to begin a new life but he had told her that he was now being deported back to Caracas, Venezuela's capital, for being in the US illegally. They had spoken that morning, just before he was due to depart.
""I thought it was a good sign that he was being deported [to Caracas],"" Myrelis Casique López recalled. She wanted him home.
But he never arrived. And while watching a television news report on Sunday, Ms Casique was shocked to see her son, not in the US or Venezuela but 1,430 miles (2,300km) away in El Salvador.
The footage showed 238 Venezuelans sent by US authorities to the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or Cecot, a notorious mega-jail. She saw men with shaved heads and shackles on their hands and feet, being forcefully escorted by heavily-armed security forces.
The Trump administration says all of the deportees are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which has found itself in the White House's crosshairs. The powerful multi-national crime group, which Trump recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation, has been accused of sex trafficking, drug smuggling and murders both at home and in major US cities.
Ms Casique told the BBC she was certain her son was among the detainees, even if no official list of names has been released.
""It's him. It's him,"" she said, gesturing at a picture in which a man is seated, with his head bowed, on a prison floor alongside a row of others, a tattoo visible on his arm. ""I recognize his features.""
She also maintains that he is innocent.
US immigration officials have said the detainees were ""carefully vetted"" and verified as gang members before being flown to El Salvador. They said they used evidence collected during surveillance, police encounters or testimonies from victims to vet them.
""Our job is to send the terrorists out before anyone else gets raped or murdered,"" Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Wednesday.
Many of the deportees do not have US criminal records, however, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official acknowledged in court documents. And they were deported under a law last invoked during wartime that doesn’t require them to be charged with a crime.
Those who do have criminal records include migrants with arrests on charges ranging from murder, fentanyl trafficking and kidnapping to home invasion and operating a gang-run brothel, according to the Trump administration.
In Mr García's case, his mother disputes that her son was involved in criminal activity. He left Venezuela in 2019, first to Peru, seeking new opportunities as overlapping economic, political and social crises engulfed the country, she said. He crossed illegally into the US in September 2023.
His mother has not seen him in person in six years.
""He doesn't belong to any criminal gang, either in the US or in Venezuela… he's not a criminal,"" Ms Casique said. ""What he's been is a barber.""
""Unfortunately, he has tattoos,"" she added, convinced that the roses and names of family members that adorn his body led to his detention and deportation. That is how she, and other family members, recognised him from pictures released of the deportees in El Salvador.
Several other families have said they believe that deportees were mistakenly identified as Tren de Aragua gang members because of their tattoos.
""It's him,"" Ms Casique said tearfully in Maracay, referencing the image from the prison. ""I wish it wasn't him… he didn't deserve to be transferred there.""
The mother of Mervin Yamarte, 29, also identified her son in the video.
""I threw myself on the floor, saying that God couldn't do this to my son,"" she told the BBC from her home in the Los Pescadores neighbourhood of Maracaibo, Venezuela.
Like Ms Casique, she denies her son was involved with the brutal gang. He had left his hometown and travelled to the US through the Darién Gap, crossing illegally in 2023 with three of his friends: Edwar Herrera, 23; Andy Javier Perozo, 30; and Ringo Rincón, 39.
The BBC spoke with their families and friends, who said they had spotted the four men in the footage from the El Salvador jail.
Mr Yamarte's mother said her son had worked in a tortilla factory, sometimes working 12-hour shifts. On Sundays, he played football with his friends, who all shared a home in Dallas, Texas.
""He's a good, noble young man. There's a mistake,"" she said.
President Trump invoked a centuries-old law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, to deport the men without due process in the US, saying they were Tren de Aragua gang members.
Despite the US government's assurances that the deportees were carefully vetted, the move has had a chilling effect on many Venezuelans and Venezuelan-Americans in the US, who fear that Trump's use of the law could lead to more Venezuelans being accused and swiftly deported without any charges or convictions.
""Of course we're afraid. We're terrified,"" said Adelys Ferro, the executive-director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus, an advocacy group. ""We want every single member of TdA to pay for their crimes. But we don't know what the criteria is.""
""They [Venezeulans] are living in uncertain times,"" she said. ""They don't know what decisions to make - even people with documents and have been here for years.""
Ms Ferro's concerns were echoed by Brian de la Vega, a prominent Florida-based, Venezuela-born immigration lawyer and military veteran.
Many of his clients are in the Miami area, including Doral - a suburb sometimes given the moniker ""Doralzuela"" for its large Venezuelan population.
""The majority of Venezuelans in the US are trying to do the right thing. They fear going back to their home country,"" Mr de la Vega told the BBC. ""The main concern, for me, is how they're identifying these members. The standard is very low.""
Many Venezuelan expatriates in the US - particularly South Florida - have been broadly supportive of Trump, who has taken a tough stance on the left-wing government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro which many of them fled.
But in February, the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status - TPS - for Venezuelans, which had shielded many from deportation. The programme officially ends on 7 April and could impact nearly 350,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the US.
""Trump's speeches have always been strong about the Venezuelan regime, especially during the campaign,"" Mr de la Vega said. ""I don't think people expected all this.""
Daniel Campo, a Venezuelan-born naturalised US citizen in Pennsylvania - and ardent Trump supporter - told the BBC that while he remains steadfast in his support of the president, he has some concerns about the deportations to El Salvador and the end of TPS.
""I certainly hope that when they are doing raids to deport Tren de Aragua, especially to the prison in El Salvador, they are being extra careful,"" he said.
Among those caught by surprise by the end of TPS and the recent deportations is a 25-year-old Venezuelan man who asked to be identified only as Yilber, who arrived in the US in 2022 after a long, dangerous journey through Central America and Mexico.
He's now in the US - but unsure about what comes next.
""I left Venezuela because of the repression, and the insecurity. My neighbourhood in Caracas had gangs,"" he said. ""Now I don't know what's going to happen here.""",US & Canada

BBC Verify
Mike Wendling
BBC News","Enthusiasts are poring over thousands of newly released documents related to the investigation into President John F Kennedy's assassination.
As many experts expected, this latest release by the Trump administration does not answer all lingering questions about one of the US's historic turning points - the 1963 killing of Kennedy in Dallas, Texas.
But the latest batch does include documents that are now mostly or fully unredacted. They reveal further how much the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) observed JFK's killer before the shooting.
A US government investigation in the 1960s concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a drifter and former US Marine who at one point defected to the then-Soviet Union, acted alone when he shot at Kennedy's motorcade from a nearby building.
However, the case still prompts questions, along with wild conspiracy theories, more than 60 years later - and the latest release is unlikely to change that. Here are some key takeaways.
The documents further shed light on the CIA's strong surveillance of Oswald, said Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and editor of the JFK Facts blog.
""He's a subject of deep interest to the CIA"" long before the assassination, and the extent of this has only become clear in the last few years, Mr Morley said.
Many of the new documents have been released before - but now more complete versions are available. Although specialists are still combing through, no earth-shattering stories have surfaced.
Still, Mr Morley calls it ""the most exciting news around JFK records since the 1990s"".
""Several very important documents have come into public view,"" he said.
Experts have therefore praised the release as a step forward for transparency. In the past, hundreds of thousands of documents were made available but were partially redacted. Others were held back, with officials citing national security concerns.
Philip Shenon, who wrote a 2013 book about the assassination, told the Associated Press that previously released documents described a trip Oswald took to Mexico City in September 1963, months before the assassination.
The CIA was monitoring him at that time, he said, according to the AP. ""There's reason to believe he talked openly about killing Kennedy in Mexico City and that people overheard him say that.""
In a previously released April 1975 memo, the CIA downplayed what it knew about Oswald's trip to Mexico City, the AP reported. The CIA recorded three phone calls between Oswald and a guard at the Soviet embassy, it said, but Oswald only identified himself in one.
A number of the documents shed light on Kennedy's relationship with the CIA before his death and on intelligence-gathering techniques - giving a window into Cold War operations.
A newly unredacted memo reveals a more complete version of a note written by Kennedy aide Arthur Schlesinger.
Critical of the CIA and its role in shaping foreign policy, the note shows the agency's huge presence in US embassies, even in allied countries such as France.
In it, Schlesinger warns Kennedy about the agency's influence on American foreign policy. Though not directly related to the assassination, the memo details the rocky relationship between the president and intelligence agencies.
The CIA is traditionally opposed to releasing operational or budget information, said David Barrett, a Villanova University professor and expert on the CIA and presidential power.
""It's a very good thing for the government to release these documents even if there still may be some redactions,"" he said.
One document details the use of fluoroscopic scanning - using X-rays to show images of the inside of an object.
The technique was developed to detect hidden microphones possibly used to bug CIA offices.
In another document, the CIA describes a system to secretly tag and identify public phone boxes that are tapped, using a paint only visible under ultraviolet light.
The memo is also notable for one of the names in it - James McCord, who would later gain infamy as one of the men who burgled the Watergate complex. The break-in kicked off the unravelling of the scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon.
Some well-known online accounts claimed that the recent documents reveal new details about long-alleged plots against Kennedy - even though some of the supposed revelations have been public for years.
They includes several viral posts about Gary Underhill - a World War Two military intelligence agent.
Mr Underhill reportedly claimed that a cabal of CIA agents was behind the assassination, a theory openly published in Ramparts, a left-wing magazine, in 1967. Mr Underhill's death in 1964 was ruled a suicide, but the magazine cast doubt on that as well.
Photos of a seven-page memo regarding Mr Underhill went viral on Tuesday - but the bulk of it is not new. His story has long been discussed online and the CIA memo mentioning it was first released in 2017.
Just a few sentences on one page of the memo were newly unredacted in the latest release.
And crucially the theory is based on a second-hand account published after Mr Underhill's death and includes no hard evidence.
However, the story was just one of a number of unsubstantiated theories circulating following the release of the files.
A 1992 law required all of the documents related to the assassination to be released within 25 years - but that law also included national security exceptions.
The push for greater transparency has led to more releases over time - both President Trump in his first term and President Biden, as recently as 2023, released batches of documents.
Ahead of the new release, President Trump said that he asked his staff ""not to redact anything"" from them.
That doesn't appear to be entirely the case - the new documents still have some redactions. However, experts were largely in agreement that the latest release was a step forward for transparency.
JFK Files journalist Morley said there are further documents in the National Archives yet to be released, and others held by the CIA and FBI that have not yet been accounted for.
Even though there could be more releases to come - as well as promised drops about the killings of Robert F Kennedy Sr and Martin Luther King Jr - the questions around the JFK assassination will almost certainly continue.
""Whenever there is an assassination there will be debates and to some degree there will be conspiracy theories,"" said Barrett, the Villanova historian. ""That's not going to change because of these or any other documents.""",US & Canada

Police in Alexandria, Virginia, responded to reports of an unresponsive woman at about 09:18 local time (13:00 GMT) , the department said in a statement.
Officers then located a deceased woman, who they later identified as Ms Aber, police said.
Ms Aber, 43, was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2021. She stepped down in January when Donald Trump took office.
Police said an investigation into her death was underway and Virginia's chief medical examiner will determine the cause.
A friend of the family told the BBC's US partner CBS News that Aber's death is ""believed to be the result of a longstanding medical issue"".
Ms Aber graduated from the University of Richmond in Virginia in 2003, before attending William & Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Virginia. She clerked for then-Magistrate Judge M. Hannah Lauck of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia from 2006 to 2007.
She started in the Eastern District of Virginia in 2009 as an assistant US attorney, and worked on cases involving financial fraud, public corruption, and child exploitation cases, according to the Department of Justice website.
In 2016, Ms Aber was promoted to the district's deputy chief of the criminal division.
Biden nominated her to lead the Eastern District of Virginia in August 2021, and she was unanimously confirmed by the US Senate.
As the district's top prosecutor, she oversaw about 300 prosecutors, litigators and support staff.
She stepped down from the position in early 2025 when Donald Trump took office.
US attorneys are appointed by the president. It is common for sitting US attorneys to step down when new presidential administration arrives, or for new presidents to later choose a new top prosecutor.
In statement, her successor, interim US Attorney Erik S Siebert said the office was ""heartbroken beyond words"".
""She was unmatched as a leader, mentor, and prosecutor, and she is simply irreplaceable as a human being,"" said Mr Siebert, who joined the division in 2010, the year after Ms Aber.

The shooting took place at Young Park in the city of Las Cruces, about 22:00 local time.
Four people have been charged with in relation to the three murders, Las Cruces Police Department said on Sunday, including a 15-year-old boy.
Two 19-year-old men and one 16-year-old boy died in the shooting, police said.
In a statement on X, Las Cruces police said those arrested and charged were two 17-year-old boys, a 15-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man.
Police chief Jeremy Story said there had been ""an altercation between two groups of people and that altercation escalated to gunfire between both groups"".
""Several other people were also injured in the crossfire.""
Mr Story said there had been ""ill will"" between the two groups prior to the car show.
About 50 to 60 bullet shell casings from handguns were found at the scene, police said, adding that the crime scene was huge and about 200 people had been at the park.
Police have asked any witnesses to come forward with information or video.
Those injured in the shooting ranged from ages 16 to 36. Authorities have not yet named any of the victims.
Seven patients were sent to nearby El Paso, Texas, which is just over the New Mexico border, for further medical treatment, said fire chief Michael Daniels.
Four other victims had been treated and released, Mr Daniels said.
""Today we mourn a tragic, a senseless, a horrible event that happened in our city last night,"" said Las Cruces Mayor Eric Enriquez.
""There's no place for violence like this in our community, and we will continue to work tirelessly to make our community safe,"" he said.
Police responded to reports of gunfire and potential gunshot victims near the parking lot about 22:00 local time.
Bystanders had already started administering treatment, Story said, and fire department officials began to treat victims before the scene was fully secured.
Local emergency officials, as well as individuals from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, responded to the shooting, Enriquez said.
The New York Times reported that the event was a monthly gathering for modified sports car enthusiasts.
Mr Story told the press that the car shows had become ""an issue"".
The police chief said that firearms had been present at the car gathering. He said that some were ""used in the shooting"", but that other people at the park that night were carrying firearms that were not involved in the incident.
The US has a long-running political debate over the degree to which citizens should be permitted to purchase and carry guns.
Though the US Constitution guarantees Americans the right to ""keep and bear arms"", federal law broadly governs gun access, each of the 50 states have different regulations about buying, owning, and carrying firearms.
The state of New Mexico allows people to openly carry guns in public without a permit.
It does however require a permit to carry a concealed firearm in public, and residents can apply for a permit through the state if they meet certain requirements.
Authorities did not provide details about the legal status of the guns used in Friday's shootings.
Mr Story said that the shooting was ""senseless"" and served as a reminder of the need for the ""rule of law"" in New Mexico.

BBC News","Yves-François Blanchet is leading the Bloc Québécois into a federal election for the third time, as the province - often a political wildcard - is expected to be a closely fought battleground.
The Quebec sovereigntist party only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, and it has in the past formed official opposition in the House of Commons.
The 59-year-old Blanchet became leader of the Bloc in 2019, but first got involved in politics in the 1980s as a member of the youth committee of the provincial Parti Québécois.
In 2008, he was elected to Quebec's national assembly, becoming environment minister with the provincial party.
Blanchet was born and raised in Quebec. He attended the Université de Montréal, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in history and anthropology.
After finishing school, Blanchet worked as a teacher and later led a music non-profit in Montreal.
The year Blanchet was elected leader, the Bloc increased the number of seats it had in Parliament, overtaking the New Democrats to become the party with the third-most seats in the House of Commons.
Quebec voters - and the province's 78 federal ridings - have in the past dramatically affected election outcomes in Canada.
The Bloc's mandate is to be a voice for Quebec in Ottawa.
Among the big issues in Quebec right now is the global trade war launched by US President Donald Trump. The province is home to North America's largest primary aluminium production sector.
Trump has put steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, which has already caused one Quebec aluminium plant - Alubar - to shut down its operations and layoff all 70 of its workers.
Blanchet has called the tariffs ""ill-advised,"" and said that he believes ""at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail""
He has also come out fiercely against President Donald Trump's musings about making Canada a 51st US state.
""It's enough jibber-jabber,"" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. ""We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.""
In responding to these emerging challenges from the US, Blanchet has not strayed away from putting Quebec front and centre in the conversation.
His party recently ran advertisements that asked: ""Who will speak for Quebec?""
""We must prevent Quebec from becoming Canada's bargaining chip, speaking primarily for Toronto's banks, Ontario's auto industry, and Western oil companies,"" the advertisement read. ""On the contrary, Quebec must emerge stronger.""
The province has long fiercely defended its identity, and in 2006, the House of Commons recognised that the ""Québécois form a nation within a united Canada"".
Since then, it has passed legislation defending its secularism laws and protecting use of the French language.
But threats from the US appear to have deeply worried Quebeckers, who have grown less supportive of Quebec sovereignty since Trump's ""51st state"" rhetoric.
Those numbers have not deterred Blanchet, however, who said he believes the appetite for Quebec independence will ""come roaring back"" once US-Canada relations stabilise again.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjdp25ynn7o,Who is Canada's NDP leader Jagmeet Singh?,2025-03-23T20:02:42.829Z,,"Jagmeet Singh is the first ethnic minority politician to lead a major federal party in Canada. But what role will he have in the country's next government?
Singh is running his third federal election campaign - and one where his party faces an uphill battle as recent polls show some of the lowest levels of support for Canada's left-wing New Democratic Party in years.
The NDP faces tough competition in Canada's 2025 election which is being held on 28 April. Prime Minister Mark Carney called it shortly after he was sworn in to replace former leader Justin Trudeau.
Launching his party's campaign, Singh attacked both Carney and US President Donald Trump, promising that only the New Democrats could be trusted to look out for ordinary Canadians.
A practising Sikh, Singh is a former provincial Ontario legislator and lawyer by training. The 46-year-old took the helm of the party in 2017 despite no previous experience in federal politics.
In 2022, Singh's NDP agreed to help prop up Trudeau's minority Liberal government in exchange for support on their shared political priorities, in particular in developing a national dental care programme for low-income Canadians and a national prescription drug programme.
But last September, the NDP became the last of Canada's three main opposition parties to turn on Trudeau, with Singh accusing him of ""caving"" to corporate greed.
The NDP leader has also made headlines for confronting hecklers. He once approached a man who was heckling him with insults on Parliament Hill, asking him to ""say it to my face"" in a clip that later went viral.
He has faced other confrontations in the past, including a voter who told him to ""cut your turban off"" during the 2019 election campaign - though he handled that situation cordially, replying that Canadians ""look like all sorts of people"" before walking away.
Singh was born in Scarborough, Ontario, a city in the Greater Toronto Area, to Indian immigrants from the state of Punjab.
Singh has said he was sexually abused by a taekwondo teacher as a child, revealing in a memoir later in life that he suffered the abuse while growing up in Windsor.
As a child, he also spent time in St Johns, and attended school across the border in Michigan for several years. He later got a degree in biology from the University of Western Ontario and a Bachelor of Laws from York University's Osgoode Hall Law School.
Singh worked as a criminal defence attorney for years before pursuing provincial politics, eventually running provincially for a seat in the Ontario legislature in 2011.

Reporting fromLondon, UK and Toronto, Canada","The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.
Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.
Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.
Now he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.
Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.
With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.
The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.
In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.
""Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,"" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.
""These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.""
In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.
In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.
Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.
That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.
He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.
In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.
Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of ""forward guidance"", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.
Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an ""unreliable boyfriend"", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.
Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.
In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.
Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.
In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.
He described it as his ""toughest day"" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.
The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.
His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock ""should be temporary"".
Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.
From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.
He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.
Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.
After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.
""When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,"" Carney said.
""Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.""
He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs ""until the Americans show us respect … and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade"".
The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.
""Why don't I become a circus clown?"" he told a reporter in 2012.
Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.
Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.
Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.
""I know how to manage crises,"" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. ""In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.""
Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.
The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.
They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.
Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.
In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.
He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.
One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.
Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. ""This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,"" he said.
On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.
His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.
There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dpde9dxp0o,"Who is Pierre Poilievre, the Canadian conservative aiming to end Liberal era?",2025-03-23T18:57:16.785Z,"Nadine Yousif
BBC News, Toronto","At 20 years old, Pierre Poilievre already had a roadmap for Canada.
Canada's Conservative Party leader - now 45 - laid out a low-tax, small government vision for the country in an essay contest on what he would do as prime minister.
""A dollar left in the hands of consumers and investors is more productive than a dollar spent by a politician,"" he stated.
Poilievre is now one step closer to making his vision a reality, and even gave a nod to the essay in a recent interview with conservative psychologist and commentator Jordan Peterson.
For Canadians frustrated with a sluggish economy and a housing and affordability crisis, Poilievre has promised a return to ""common sense politics"", and offered an alternative to what he labelled as former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's ""authoritarian socialism"".
He now finds himself facing a different political foe, new Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney.
While Poilievre's Conservatives have enjoyed a large lead over the struggling Trudeau Liberals in national surveys for months, support for the Liberals has shot up following Trudeau's resignation.
Now the outcome of the general election anyone's guess.
Still, Poilievre's message is being heard in large pockets of Canadian society. A win would make him part of a wave of populist leaders on the right who have toppled incumbent governments in the west.
Critics have painted him as a sort of Donald Trump ""light"" - a parallel that has become a liability amid Trump's trade war and musings about a ""51st state"".
Poilievre has sought to distance himself from the US president, positioning himself as a ""tough guy"" who can take on Trump.
Poilievre was born in Canada's western province of Alberta to a 16-year-old mother who put him up for adoption. He was taken in by two school teachers, who raised him in suburban Calgary.
""I have always believed that it is voluntary generosity among family and community that are the greatest social safety net that we can ever have,"" he told Maclean's Magazine in 2022, reflecting on his early life.
""That's kind of my starting point.""
As a teenager, Poilievre showed an early interest in politics, and canvassed for local conservatives.
Poilievre was studying international relations at the University of Calgary when he met Stockwell Day, who served as a cabinet minister under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
At the time, Day was seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance - a right-wing party with Alberta roots that became part of the modern-day Conservatives in a 2003 merger - and he tapped Poilievre to help with campus outreach.
""He impressed me from the start,"" Day told the BBC in an interview. ""He seemed to be a level-headed guy, but full of energy and able to catch people's attention.""
Day's leadership bid was successful, and he set out for Ottawa with Poilievre as his assistant. Some time after, Poilievre walked into his office on a cold winter night to ask his opinion about potentially running for office.
Poilievre went on to win a seat in Ottawa in 2004 at the age of 25, making him one of the youngest elected Conservatives at the time. He has held that seat since.
In Ottawa, Poilievre was given the nickname Skippy by peers and foes alike due to to his youthful enthusiasm and sharp tongue.
He built a reputation for being ""highly combative and partisan"", said Randy Besco, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto.
Behind the closed doors of Conservative caucus meetings, Poilievre showed his diplomatic side, Day said.
""Pierre was always good at saying, 'Okay, you know what? I hadn't thought of that,' or he would listen and say: 'Have you thought of this?'"" said Day.
Still, confrontational politics became a cornerstone of Poilievre's public persona. After becoming Conservative leader in 2022, he would target Trudeau with biting remarks as a way to connect with disaffected voters.
It has landed him in trouble at times. In April, he was expelled from the House of Commons for calling the former prime minister a ""wacko"".
Poilievre told the Montreal Gazette in June that he is a fan of ""straight talk"".
""I think when politesse is in conflict with the truth, I choose the truth,"" he said. ""I think we've been too polite for too long with our political class.""
His combative style has also been divisive, and he has been criticised for oversimplifying complex issues for political gain.
While Canadians have been open to the opposition leader's message as a change from Trudeau's brand of progressive politics, just under half of them hold an unfavourable opinion of him, according to a recent poll.
Poilievre has also had to shift his sights since Trudeau's resignation to get ahead of the inevitable match-up between him and Carney.
The Conservative leader has been described as a ""soft"" populist for his direct appeals to everyday Canadians and criticism of establishment elites, including corporate Canada.
It has been pointed out as a weakness by his critics, as the bulk of Canadians have become angry and frustrated with another well-known, nearby populist - Donald Trump.
Canadians priorities have shifted since the Trump administration launched a trade war against Canada, with the relationship between the two countries now the top of mind for voters.
It has forced Poilievre, who had not stepped much into foreign policy prior, to pivot. He has since pushed back at Trump's comments suggesting Canada become a 51st US state, vowing to ""put Canada first"".
""While Canadians are slow to anger and quick to forgive, once provoked, we fight back. And we will fight back,"" Poilievre has said in an address directed at Trump.
Trump has disparaged the Conservative leader in response, telling the UK magazine The Spectator that he is not ""MAGA enough."" In an interview with Fox News, Trump said that Poilievre is ""stupidly no friend of mine"".
On domestic issues, Poilievre has pledged to deliver ""the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history"", promising to keep repeat offenders behind bars.
He also came out in support of those who protested vaccine mandates during the 2021 ""Freedom Convoy"" demonstrations that gridlocked Ottawa for weeks.
On social matters, he has rarely weighed in - something Prof Besco said is typical of senior Conservatives, who see these topics as ""a losing issue"".
While Poilievre voted against legalising gay marriage in the early 2000s, he has recently said it will remain legal ""full stop"" if he is elected.
The Conservatives also do not support legislation to regulate abortion, though they allow MPs to vote freely on the issue.
""I would lead a small government that minds its own business,"" Poilievre said in June.
Amid a public debate in Canada in recent months on immigration, the Conservative party has said it would tie levels of newcomers to the number of new homes built, and focus on bringing in skilled workers.
Poilievre's wife, Anaida, arrived in Canada as a child refugee from Caracas, Venezuela.
The Conservative leader has pushed for the integration of newcomers, saying Canada does not need to be a ""hyphenated society"".
One of his major promises - to cut Trudeau's national carbon pricing programme, arguing it is a financial burden for families - has raised questions over how his government would tackle pressing issues like climate change.
Liberal leader Carney scrapped the unpopular consumer carbon tax this month, shortly after being sworn in.
Above all, Poilievre has said that he wants to do away with ""grandiosity"" and ""utopian wokesim"" that he believes has defined the Trudeau era, in favour of the ""the things that are grand and great about the common people"".
""I've been saying precisely the same thing this entire time,"" he told Mr Peterson.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydlr3reqpo,A simple guide to Canada's federal election,2025-03-23T17:42:01.325Z,,"Mark Carney, former two-time central banker, was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister earlier this month, after being elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.
On Sunday, he called a snap election.
Several political leaders had called for a vote after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January.
But after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war, calls have grown for Canada to go to the polls as soon as possible.
With the snap election call, Carney is sending Canadians the polls in a matter of weeks.
The election will be held on Monday 28 April.
By law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote was officially scheduled for 20 October 2025.
However, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered:
The first scenario is what Carney did on Sunday.
In the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister.
Instead, the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) becomes PM.
That means Carney will be in the running, along with Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party.
Four main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois.
The Liberal Party has been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. At dissolution, it held 153 seats.
The Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats.
The Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, had 33 seats, and the NDP had 24.
The Green Party held two seats.
During the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead.
But the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down.
Following Trump's decision to introduce steep tariffs against Canada, they tightened further, suggesting a neck-and-neck race.
When Trudeau resigned at the beginning of 2025, he did so under significant pressure from his own party. It was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the Liberals' hopes of winning the next election.
National polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), suggest how support for the Liberals weakened throughout 2023 and 2024.
At the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January 2025 - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%.
Since then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that 37.5% of Canadians back the Liberals, while 37.1% support the Conservatives.
This marks the first time in three years the Liberals are leading in the polls, according to the CBC.
How to respond to President Trump's economic threats has overtaken the cost of living as the dominant issue for voters.
There are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons.
All the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election.
Members of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election.
Like the UK, Canada has a ""first-past-the-post"" electoral system.
The candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area.
The leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs normally forms the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition.
If no party ends up with an overall majority of seats, the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government.
Practically, it means the party with the most seats will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.

BBC News","US President Donald Trump revoked security clearances from his previously defeated Democratic election rivals, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of other former officials and critics.
Trump said in February he was revoking security clearance for his predecessor Joe Biden. His order confirmed that decision, adding that he was also revoking the security clearance of ""any other member"" of the Biden family.
""I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,"" Trump's memorandum read.
Former US presidents and top security officials usually keep their security clearance as a courtesy.
Trump ordered department and agency leaders to ""revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities for these individuals.""
""This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress,"" the order stated.
For several named figures, the loss of access to classified material and spaces will have a more symbolic impact.
It may limit the materials they are able to review, or restrict access to some government buildings or secure facilities.
The lawyers and prosecutors named by Trump, however, could potentially face roadblocks in accessing or reviewing information for their cases or clients.
Trump's revocations focus on top Biden administration officials, as well as prominent political critics and attorneys who have challenged Trump or his allies in court.
Biden's secretary of state Antony Blinken, national security advisor Jake Sullivan, and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco all lost their clearances.
Trump also targeted two of his own former officials from his first term: Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who testified during his first impeachment trial that began in 2019.
Trump also revoked access for high-profile Republican critics, former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.
They were the only two Republican lawmakers who joined a US House investigation into Trump's role in the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress.
Both also voted to charge Trump in his second impeachment, which a Democratic-led US House of Representatives instigated after the riot. Trump was acquitted by the Senate on the charge of inciting the 6 January riot.
Trump has also singled out top legal opponents in his latest decision on security access. His order revoked clearance for New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought multiple lawsuits against Trump and his businesses.
In a civil fraud lawsuit that concluded in 2024, a judge found Trump liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. Trump is appealing the decision.
Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who prosecuted and won Trump's criminal hush money case last year, also lost his clearance.
Trump's legal targets went beyond elected prosecutors. He withdrew security clearance for Norm Eisen, an attorney leading multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce.
Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump during his first term and later provided media commentary about the hush money trial, also lost his clearance.
Previous media reports had indicated that the administration had pulled the security clearance for a top whistleblower attorney in Washington, Mark Zaid.
Friday's order listed him among the individuals who would lose access.
However, Mr Zaid told the BBC that ""despite being told three times that my clearance has been revoked, I still have not received anything formally.""
He claimed losing his security clearance would harm ""the federal employees, including Trump supporters, who count on me to handle cases few other lawyers could.""
Several of the individuals chosen by Trump derided his order in social media statements.
""I don't care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn't been active for five years,"" Mr Vindman wrote on X.
Mr Eisen wrote on X that being targeted by Trump's order ""just makes me file even more lawsuits!""
Trump had earlier pulled security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials whom he accused of meddling in the 2020 election in Joe Biden's favour. He provided no evidence for these claims.
In February, Trump announced he was revoking Biden's security access. In a social media post, Trump said Biden ""set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents"".
In 2021, Biden - serving as president at the time - barred his defeated rival Trump from having access to intelligence briefings citing his ""erratic behaviour"".
A 2024 Justice Department special counsel report found Biden had improperly retained classified documents from his time as vice president. The report noted that Biden had cooperated with federal investigators and returned the discovered documents.
In 2023, Justice Department special prosecutor Jack Smith indicted Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents following his first term in office and obstructing their return to the government.
Trump pleaded not guilty and a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. Smith officially dropped the case that December after Trump won re-election.",US & Canada

BBC News","A US federal judge has reprimanded government lawyers as he questioned President Donald Trump's invocation of rarely used powers to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants.
Judge James Boasberg repeatedly clashed with justice department attorney Drew Ensign during a court hearing in Washington DC, saying he was not used to such ""intemperate, disrespectful language"" in government filings.
Trump last Saturday deported 238 Venezuelan alleged gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador after invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, last used during World War Two.
Speaking in the Oval Office earlier on Friday, the Republican president insisted his administration was getting ""bad people out of our country"", and renewed his attacks on Judge Boasberg, describing him as a ""radical left lunatic"".
The Trump administration maintains the men were ""carefully vetted"" and verified as gang members before being flown to El Salvador.
Some of their family members, however, have disputed that allegation, and US officials have acknowledged ""many"" of the men have no US criminal record. Venezuela's interior ministry has also disputed that the men had links to the Tren de Aragua gang.
At Friday's hearing, Judge Boasberg said he agreed that the US president had ""wide latitude"" to enforce immigration law.
But he expressed reservations that the deported migrants had no legal remedy to contest whether they were gang members or not.
""The policy ramifications of this are incredibly troublesome and problematic and concerning,"" Judge Boasberg said.
Last Saturday, he issued a verbal order to the government to turn around the deportation flights, but the White House said it was too late as the planes were already in international airspace.
The timing of the flights was a contentious issue in court on Friday.
""Did you not understand that when I said do that immediately, I meant it?"" Judge Boasberg told Mr Ensign.
He said the Trump administration would be held accountable if they breached his court order.
""The government's not being terribly co-operative at this point, but I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my word,"" he said.
The judge could hold specific Trump officials in contempt of court for defying his ruling, although the president himself has broad immunity from any legal repercussions for official acts while in office.
Outside the White House on Friday, a journalist asked Trump about the signing of last week's presidential proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act.
""I don't know when it was signed because I didn't sign it,"" he said.
The White House later told the BBC that Trump did personally sign the executive order. Their emailed statement said the president was talking about the 1798 law when he said he did not sign it.
The deportations case has raised constitutional questions given that US government agencies are generally expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.
At another hearing on Thursday, Judge Boasberg dismissed a government court filing on the migrant deportation flights as ""woefully insufficient"".
Trump has called for the judge to be impeached, and accused him of trying to usurp the presidency.
Earlier this week Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare admonishment, without naming Trump, saying impeachment was ""not an appropriate response"".
The government has appealed against Judge Boasberg's temporary restraining order. A hearing is due at the city's court of appeals on Monday.",US & Canada

BBC News","President Donald Trump has rescinded an executive order targeting a prestigious international law firm after it promised to abandon diversity policies and provide $40m (£31m) worth of free legal work to support White House initiatives.
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is a multinational law firm headquartered in New York that has many high-profile clients.
Trump's 14 March order had terminated federal contracts with the firm and suspended security clearances for its lawyers, saying it was undermining the US judicial system.
The firm is now facing blowback from many in the legal community, including a top lawyer for Democrats, even as some lawyers said it had few other options.
Trump has issued similar executive orders against the law firms Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling.
The White House rescinded the order on Thursday after a meeting between Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton.
In a post on Truth Social, the president said the firm had agreed to a series of concessions, including the promise to provide ""the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives"".
It added that Paul Weiss would commit to ""merit-based"" hiring and promotion, and ""will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies"".
Trump's order last week had cancelled contracts with the firms citing Trump's orders to wipe out any initiatives aimed at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) within the federal government.
The Truth Social post also included a statement from Mr Karp, who said: ""We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.""
Many in the legal community have expressed outrage over the deal, which one lawyer said was a ""sad day for the legal industry"".
Marc Elias, a former Perkins Coie partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, assailed the agreement in a post on social media platform Bluesky.
""Paul Weiss, didn't just bend a knee, it set a new standard for shameful capitulation,"" he wrote. ""This is a stain on the firm, every one of its partners, and the entire legal profession.""
Soon after Trump made the announcement, Rachel Cohen, an associate at the Skadden Arps legal firm, resigned in a blistering company-wide email condemning the agreement.
""Please consider this email my two week notice, revocable if the firm comes up with a satisfactory response to the current moment,"" she wrote. Cohen had asked Skadden to sign onto a brief supporting another firm that has sued the Trump administration.
She had helped organise the open letter criticising the Trump administration for attempting to ""bully corporate law firms out of engaging in any representation that challenges the administration's aims"". More than 300 associates have signed the letter, using the name of their firm and class year, since it went live about a week ago, Politico reported.
In an internal email to its lawyers, Mr Karp defended the agreement, saying it was in line with the firm's principles, including a commitment to remaining politically independent, Reuters reported.
The firm brought in more than $2bn in annual revenues in 2023, and employed more than 1,000 attorneys, according to American Lawyer Magazine. Revoking its security clearance, which allows its lawyers to see some sensitive information, could have created hurdles to its work with its many corporate, security and Wall Street clients.
In the original executive order, Trump had accused the firm of playing ""an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles"".
It had cited ""a Paul Weiss partner"" who had filed a pro bono lawsuit against the perpetrators of the 6 January 2021 riots at the Capitol. Trump has released all and pardoned many of those known as ""J6ers"".
It also took direct aim at Mark Pomerantz - a former partner who had worked with the Manhattan District Attorney on the case involving hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted by a jury last year of having committed a felony in the case.
The order had also alleged that the firm ""discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws"".",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79zxzj90nno,What does the US education department do - and can Trump truly dismantle it?,2025-03-21T18:58:06.048Z,"Ana Faguy
BBC News, Washington DC","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aiming to begin the dismantling of the Department of Education.
It's a long-held goal of conservatives but the complete shuttering of the department is unlikely as it would take an act of Congress.
Since Trump returned to the White House, the department has already announced plans to slash about half of its workforce.
Established in 1979, the department oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.
Trump and his allies have accused the agency of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual and political material.
A common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts.
The agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university.
It also helps fund programmes to support students with disabilities and for students living in poverty.
And the department enforces civil rights law designed to prevent race or sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools.
The department's allocation was $238bn (£188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget.
The agency has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department. The Trump administration has sought to cut that and the department announced plans to slash about half of its workforce.
Most public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments.
In 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil.
On his own, no.
Not only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of the department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US Senate - 60 out of 100 senators.
Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would need at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political longshot.
Even in the House of Representatives, Trump might struggle to gain necessary support.
A vote last year to abolish the education department - which was attached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans joined all Democrats in the House to vote no.
But Trump is still moving ahead with his plan to shut the department.
His executive order directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure"" of the agency and transfer authority to state and local governments.
It also instructs her to ensure ""the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely"".
It does not include a timeline or deadline for the move, which is expected to face legal challenges.
Trump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent weeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves.
Education department employees are among those who are the focus of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce.
Trump previously promised that part of his dismantling of the education department would include rehousing certain programmes, such as student loans, in different government agencies.
On Friday, he announced the student loans portfolio would be moved from the education department to the small business administration ""immediately"".
That portfolio includes more than $1.5tn (£1.1tn) in loans taken out by more than 40 million Americans.
The text of the executive order shutting the education department down compares the debt portfolio managed by the department to the size of the Wells Fargo bank.
""The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America's students,"" the executive order states.
Regardless of which agency manages student loans, borrowers will still have to pay them back.
Court rulings and Trump's policies have reversed some changes that former President Joe Biden attempted to make to lower borrowing costs and forgive some debts.
The idea of eliminating the education department has been floated by Republicans for nearly as long as it has existed.
During Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, he pushed for it to be dismantled.
Republicans have historically pushed against centralising education policy, believing that it is best left up to individual states and localities.
More recently they have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as ""woke"" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race.
Trump's allies also want to expand school choice, which would allow students and families to use public money to select private or religious alternatives to public schools.
Conservatives argue that education department functions should be handled by other agencies, for instance that civil rights infractions are the Department of Justice's domain.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48nj42j5vo,US small business agency to oversee student loans,2025-03-21T18:39:22.238Z,"Ana Faguy
BBC News, Washington DC","The Small Business Administration (SBA) will oversee the students loans of some 40 million borrowers, US President Donald Trump said on Friday, a day after he ordered the dismantling of the education department.
The move to shutter much of the education agency - a campaign promise from Trump - raised questions about what would happen to services housed there, including student loan management.
""[SBA is] all set for it, they're waiting for it and it will be serviced much better than it has in the past, it's been a mess,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday.
Trump said the move on loans would happen ""immediately"" but offered no specifics on timeline.
In addition to the SBA's take over of student loans, Trump said the Health and Human Services Department will start handling some services for students - another function previously performed by the education department.
""[Robert F Kennedy Jr] will be handling special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else. Rather complex,"" Trump said.
Earlier in the week, Trump accused the education department of ""breath-taking failures"", and vowed to return the money it controls to individual states.
States already control most aspects of education in the US, including setting curriculum. Most US children attend public schools, which are free and run by state and local officials.
The federal agency did handle loan programs that helped US students pay for university tuition.
The shifts come as the Trump administration continues to curtail government spending, shutting down agencies and laying off staff.
The SBA separately announced Friday that it planned to slash more than 40% of its workforce.
Officials said the cuts would save the agency more than $435 million a year by next fiscal year.",US & Canada

BBC News, Washington","President Donald Trump has awarded Boeing a multi-billion dollar contract to build the US Air Force's most advanced fighter jet, the Next Generation Air Dominance aircraft.
Trump described the high-speed stealth aircraft, dubbed the F-47, as the ""most lethal aircraft ever built"" and said a version has been secretly flying for the last five years.
The jet will replace Lockheed Martin's F-22 with an aircraft that is also designed to fly alongside unmanned drones in combat, Trump announced at the White House.
The exact value of the contract remains undisclosed, but it is a boost for Boeing, which has struggled with sluggish commercial and military sales, as well as high-profile safety issues.
The design of the ""sixth-generation"" aircraft remains a closely guarded secret, but reportedly includes high advanced sensors and engines in addition to their stealth capabilities.
An artistic rendering alongside Trump in the Oval Office of the White House only showed a small part of the aircraft and front landing gear.
""There's never been anything even close to it, from speed to manoeuverability, to what it can have, to payload,"" Trump said.
The president also mentioned that the US military had selected the number 47 - which he described as a ""beautiful number"" - for the aircraft. He is the 45th and 47th President of the US.
""The generals picked that title,"" he said.
The Boeing deal also marks a defeat for competitor Lockheed Martin, which was recently eliminated from a separate competition to build a next-generation aircraft for the US Navy.
Sales of the company's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a fifth-generation aircraft, could also be threatened by mounting trade tensions between the US and its allies abroad.
Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has asked Defence Minister Bill Blair to review its purchase of the aircraft, which was developed with Canada as a partnership.
In Portugal, the country's outgoing defence minister told local media that the country is re-thinking a purchase of F-35s to replace its older aircraft as a result of ""recent positions"" taken by the US government.
Each F-35 costs about $85m (£65.8m), with the price rising up to $150m once spare parts and support infrastructure are included.
About 1,100 of the aircraft have been built, and F-35s are in service with 16 militaries around the world.
Several countries are reportedly now mulling purchasing aircraft from European manufacturers such as Dassault and Saab, even if those aircraft lack the stealth capabilities of the F-35.
Elon Musk, a key ally of Trump's, has previously expressed scepticism of manned aircraft.
He was at the Pentagon ahead of the F-47 announcement on Friday, on a visit which Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said was about cost-cutting.",US & Canada

Investigations correspondent, BBC News•@rianna_croxford","More than 40 men have now come forward accusing the former chief executive of Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) of rape, sexual assault or drugging, lawyers have told the BBC.
Mike Jeffries, who was charged with sex trafficking in October, is facing multiple civil lawsuits alleging he assaulted men under the guise of modelling opportunities with the fashion brand.
The latest claims stretch back to the 1990s, when Mr Jeffries first started working at A&F and the alleged victims now include company employees as well as former models, the lawyers said.
Mr Jeffries has denied all the allegations previously made against him.
A&F is also being sued for negligence with the lawsuits claiming that it knowingly facilitated the ""heinous sexual crimes"" of Mr Jeffries and his British life partner, Matthew Smith.
The company - which also owns the Hollister brand - did not respond to requests for comment but has previously said it was ""appalled and disgusted"" by Mr Jeffries' alleged behaviour.
In the latest allegations, some men say they were already A&F employees when they were sexually assaulted, raising questions about what steps the company took to protect staff and hold Mr Jeffries accountable while he was chief executive and chairman between 1992 and 2014.
Now 80, Mr Jeffries is under house arrest after pleading not guilty to charges of running an international sex trafficking and prostitution business along with his partner Mr Smith, 61, and their middleman, James Jacobson, 72.
Their arrests followed a BBC podcast and documentary in 2023 that revealed they were behind a highly organised operation scouting young men for sex across the US, Europe and North Africa. They face a maximum of life in prison if convicted.
Brad Edwards, a civil trial lawyer, has told the BBC he is now representing 26 alleged victims in a lawsuit seeking class action status - where one or more people sue on behalf of a wider group.
""There is strength in numbers, so more men came forward after the arrests,"" Mr Edwards said, adding that many were co-operating with the authorities, and claiming it is likely more than 100 men could be victims overall.
Attorney Jared Scotto has told the BBC he is also representing more than a dozen men planning to take legal action, including some who say they were A&F employees. He said the claims date back to the autumn of 1992, the year that Mike Jeffries joined the company.
""A lot of men are coming forward to ask questions and better understand what happened to them,"" said Mr Scotto. ""Now they know it's not just them affected; it was part of a larger nefarious scheme.""
Separate to the group civil action, two lawsuits have recently been filed in New York by men alleging they were raped by Mr Jeffries after being falsely promised modelling opportunities.
The first of these lawsuits alleges two men, Brandon Steele and Joseph Sterling, were assaulted on multiple occasions after being pressured to take illegal narcotics and forced to endure penis injections. These happened at ""Abercrombie-themed"" events where they were given A&F clothing to wear, the lawsuit says.
Both men, who were in their late teens and 20s at the time, say they were initially approached by an A&F employee or representative about possible modelling work in 2010 and 2011, according to the court papers and their attorney.
They each then met James Jacobson, who also sexually abused them, they add.
""Coercive sex is not consensual sex,"" said their attorney Robert Georges, who told the BBC that Mr Sterling had been taken to France, Italy, St Barts and onboard an ocean liner sailing from Hong Kong to Australia.
""The power imbalance was extreme, and Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith used it shamelessly while Abercrombie & Fitch ignored the obvious for the sake of corporate profits.""
In the second lawsuit, two former models say they were assaulted by Mr Jeffries during a casting call at the Setai Hotel in Miami in 2011, while auditioning to be pictured on A&F's bags.
One of the models alleges that Mr Jeffries sexually assaulted him after taking his pictures, telling him that ""Abercrombie models get special treatment"".
The other, who was represented by Wilhelmina Models, a top modelling agency, claims Mr Jeffries' assaulted him after he and his partner Matthew Smith ""relentlessly"" questioned him about his sexuality and expressed an interest in straight men.
Three weeks later, the men say they were contacted by James Jacobson with an offer to fly to New York to visit Mr Jeffries' home in the Hamptons to finalise the A&F casting.
According to their lawsuit, the men allege Mr Jeffries subsequently raped them.
One says this occurred after Mr Jeffries asked if he would have sex with a man in exchange for pay, gifts, or other favours.
""No, I'm straight and have a girlfriend,"" he said, according to his lawsuit. He says he was then dismissed but Mr Jeffries later accosted him in a bathroom.
In his lawsuit, he says he then grappled with Mr Jeffries and yelled at him to stop. He says when he finally did, Mr Jeffries asked: ""Do you want this campaign or not?""
The man says he rejected the offer of an A&F campaign deal and $6,000 (£4,600) to have sex with him and Mr Smith. He then tried to run out of the room, but Mr Jeffries grabbed him by the waist and raped him, the lawsuit claims.
A handler for Mr Jeffries then refused to arrange for him to return to New York without signing a non-disclosure agreement until he threatened to call the police, it adds.
Eric M Baum and Adriana Alcalde, attorneys for the two men, said it was often difficult for male survivors of sexual abuse, such as their clients, to come forward.
""Survivors may struggle for years to process what happened to them. Seeing others share their stories can reduce feelings of shame and embarrassment, serving as a catalyst for seeking justice,"" they said.
US prosecutors have said that there are currently 15 victims in the criminal case against Mr Jeffries, but the BBC understands that they are continuing to interview potential witnesses, so this number may grow.
Earlier this month, a court ordered that A&F must pay Mr Jeffries' legal fees - a bill likely to run into millions - in the criminal case as well as in all the civil lawsuits.
Mr Jeffries, Mr Smith and Mr Jacobson did not respond to the BBC's latest requests for comment.
Mr Jacobson - the middleman - has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and has previously said in a statement through his lawyer that he took offence at the suggestion of ""any coercive, deceptive or forceful behaviour on my part"" and had ""no knowledge of any such conduct by others"".
Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith have also pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and, in response to the civil case, have previously said they ""vehemently deny"" the allegations.
A&F also did not respond to requests for comment, though it has previously said that it had no knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct or sex trafficking and ""up until the moment that the BBC's reporting was released in October 2023, there was nothing public about the allegations against Jeffries"".
It said that new leadership had since transformed the company, and it has ""zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind"".
Following the BBC's reporting, the retailer opened an independent investigation and suspended $1m annual retirement payments to Mr Jeffries, which he was receiving on top of his pension.",US & Canada

BBC News, Washington DC","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign pledge and a long-cherished goal of some conservatives.
Accusing the agency of ""breath-taking failures"", the Republican president vowed to return the money it controls to individual states.
""We're going to shut it down as quickly as possible,"" Trump said, although the White House acknowledged that closing the agency outright would require an act of Congress.
The move is already facing legal challenges from those seeking to block the agency's closure as well as sweeping cuts to its staff announced last week.
Most US children attend public schools, which are free and run by local officials.
A common misconception is that the federal education department operates US schools and sets curriculum, but that is primarily done by states and local districts.
A relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools - about 13% - comes from federal funds. Most of the money comes from state and local taxes.
Established in 1979, the department administers student loans and runs programmes to help low-income students.
But Trump has accused it of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual, and political material.
Surrounded by children seated at school desks in the White House on Thursday, Trump said ""the US spends more money on education by far than any other country"", yet he added that students rank near the bottom of the list.
The Unesco Institute for Statistics said the US spends roughly 5.4% of its GDP on education, which is higher than many countries but not all.
The department's budget last year was $238bn (£188bn), which is less than 2% of federal spending.
The White House stated that his administration would move to cut parts of the department that remain within legal boundaries.
The executive order is likely to face legal challenges, like many of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.
At the signing ceremony, Trump praised Linda McMahon, whom he appointed to lead the department, and expressed his hope she would be the last secretary of education.
He said he would find ""something else"" for her to do within the administration.
After Trump signed the order, Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy announced plans to bring legislation aimed at closing the department.
But Republicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, and closing a federal department would require 60 votes, making such a goal a longshot.
But even if the department is not formally closed, the Trump administration could decimate its funding and staff as it has done with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which subsequently stopped many of its programmes and humanitarian work.
The text of the executive order does not include specifics on what actions the administration will take and which programmes might be axed.
It orders McMahon to ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure"" of the department and give authority of such matters to state and local governments.
It also directs her to ensure ""the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely"".
Soon after she was sworn in, McMahon sent the department's 4,400 employees a memo titled ""Our Department's Final Mission"", a possible reference to Trump's aim to close it.
""This is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students,"" she wrote.
""I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.""
Earlier reports suggested Trump would look to end some of the department's programmes and send others to different departments, such as the Treasury, something that still may happen but wasn't made clear in his executive order.
America's largest teachers' union recently decried Trump's plans, saying he ""doesn't care about opportunity for all kids"".
In its statement, the American Federation of Teachers said: ""No-one likes bureaucracy, and everyone's in favour of more efficiency, so let's find ways to accomplish that.
""But don't use a 'war on woke' to attack the children living in poverty and the children with disabilities.""
For more than 40 years, conservatives have complained about the department and floated ideas to abolish it.
Just two years after it was established by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, his Republican replacement, Ronald Reagan, led calls to undo it.
It is the smallest agency in the president's cabinet and takes up less than 2% of the total federal budget.
Some of those staff have already been affected by the Trump administration's sweeping workforce cuts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
Nearly 2,100 people at the agency are set to be placed on leave from Friday.
Efforts by Doge to slash federal spending and radically restructure - or simply abolish - many government agencies have been overseen by tech billionaire Elon Musk.",US & Canada

BBC News","A US court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this week.
Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral fellow studying and teaching at the prestigious Washington DC institution on a student visa.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of ""spreading Hamas propaganda"" and having ""close connections to a known or suspected terrorist"".
Mr Suri's lawyer and employer have denied the allegation. His lawyer said in a court filing that his client was targeted because of his wife's ""identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech"".
In an order on Thursday, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Mr Suri ""shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order"".
In a sworn statement, his wife Mapheze Saleh said the detention ""has completely upended our lives"" and appealed to the court to allow Mr Suri to return home to his family.
""Our children are in desperate need of their father and miss him dearly,"" she said. ""As a mother of three children, I desperately need his support to take care of them and me.""
His arrest follows the detention or deportation of other foreign students and academics, including Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist.
Mr Suri was arrested outside his home in northern Virginia on Monday night by masked immigration agents, according to legal filings seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner.
He was told the agents were with DHS, the filings say, and they informed him the government had revoked his visa and he was now facing expulsion from the country.
Mr Suri was taken to Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana where he is being held, according to US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, said on X that Mr Suri was ""actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media"".
She accused him of having ""close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas"" without providing any further detail.
Mr Suri's father-in-law is a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the Washington Post and New York Times reported.
In her court statement, Ms Saleh said her father lived in the US for nearly 20 years while pursuing a master's and PhD. ""Afterward, he served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as the deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza,"" she said.
Ms Saleh said he left the Gaza government in 2010 and ""started the House of Wisdom in 2011 to encourage peace and conflict resolution in Gaza"".
Mr Suri's court filings allege that he and his wife Mapheze Saleh - a US citizen of Palestinian descent - had ""long been doxxed and smeared"" online by an ""anonymously-run blacklisting site"".
The BBC has contacted Mr Suri's lawyer for more details.
A spokesman for Georgetown University told the BBC that Mr Suri had been ""granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan"".
The institution was ""not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention"".
""We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable,"" the spokesman said. ""We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.""
In her post on X, Ms McLaughlin said Secretary of State Marco Rubio ""issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable"".
The BBC has contacted DHS to request more detail on the allegations against Mr Suri, and also asked the Indian embassy in Washington DC for comment.
Several students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for ""violence and terrorism"".
Khalil, a Columbia graduate and permanent US resident, was arrested on 8 March after being involved in pro-Palestinian protests on campus. He was accused of having ties to Hamas, which he denies.
Columbia student Leqaa Kordia, who is a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested for ""overstaying her student visa"". She had previously been arrested in April 2024 for taking part in protests at Columbia University, according to DHS.
Ranjani Srinivasan, another Columbia University student, chose to ""self-deport"". Officials said her student visa was revoked on 5 March. Her lawyers say she attended a handful of protests and had shared or liked social media posts related to Palestinians in Gaza.
Brown University professor and kidney transplant specialist Rasha Alawieh, who is Lebanese, was deported after arriving at Boston airport. US officials said they found ""photos and videos"" on her cell phone that were ""sympathetic"" to the former longtime leader of Hezbollah and militants.
According to a transcript of her interview reviewed by Reuters, she told customs officials she did not support Hezbollah but had high regard for its leader because of her religion.

A federal jury in New York found Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov guilty of plotting to assassinate reporter Masih Alinejad in July 2022. They face decades in prison.
Prosecutors said Iran's government funded the plot and targeted Ms Alinejad over her campaigns against the mandatory wearing of headscarves for Iranian women.
Iran's government, which has been accused in several plots targeting Ms Alinejad, has called such allegations ""ridiculous and baseless"".
The two men, who prosecutors said were Russian mobsters, were found guilty on charges that included murder for hire, firearms possession and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
The Manhattan jury returned their verdict after deliberating for just over three hours following a two-week trial.
Prosecutors said Iran attempted several times over the years to silence and threaten Ms Alinejad, including a failed kidnap plot that led to the arrest of four Iranian intelligence officials in 2021.
When those efforts failed, they put a $500,000 (£385,793) bounty out for her killing, the US government said.

Bondi said the damage to Tesla cars, dealerships and charging stations was ""domestic terrorism"".
Arrests and charges against the three suspects were previously announced by prosecutors.
Tesla dealerships across the country have been targeted in a wave of protests, but also vandalism and arson attacks, in response to Musk's influence over the Trump administration.
There is no specific US law against domestic terrorism, but prosecutors can request longer prison sentences if convicted criminals have a terrorism-related motive.
Trump and Musk have called the attacks domestic terrorism, too. Supporters of the administration have also reportedly been ""swatted"" – subjected to armed police raids after hoax emergency calls.
A statement from the Department of Justice on Thursday did not name the suspects in the Tesla vandalism. However, the details of the three cases outlined in the news release match arrests and charges previously announced by prosecutors.
The suspects include Lucy Nelson, 42, who was charged with possession of a destructive device and malicious destruction of property after being spotted near the site of a Tesla dealership in Colorado.
The dealership had been targeted with a Molotov cocktail attack and graffiti which caused damage of between $5,000 and $20,000, according to a criminal complaint. That suspect has pleaded not guilty.
Adam Matthew Lansky, 41, was charged with possession of a destructive device after Molotov cocktails were thrown at a Tesla dealership in Salem, Oregon. He has yet to enter a plea and will face a preliminary hearing in April.
The third, 24-year-old Daniel Clarke-Pounder, was charged with arson after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla charging stations in North Charleston, South Carolina, and spray-painting the car park.

BBC News","Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney is likely to call a national election for 28 April, potentially as soon as this Sunday, multiple news outlets report.
With Canada's businesses reeling from a trade dispute with the US, Carney - a former two-time central banker - is expected to pitch himself as the candidate best equipped to take on Donald Trump.
The 60-year-old political newcomer took over as leader of the Liberal Party after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepped down from his nine-year term.
The prime minister's announcement to call an election and request the dissolution of Parliament will kick off a five-week campaign for Carney and his political opponents.
While the timing of the request to dissolve parliament is clear - the exact election date is not.
The prime minister is leaning towards setting April 28 as the voting date, the Globe and Mail and the Associated Press reported on Thursday, citing sources in the government.
Some suggest a shorter campaign could work in Carney's favour, since much of the current national discourse revolves around the ongoing trade war between the US and Canada, particularly after President Trump's threats and actions.
The election is ""almost certain to focus on US President Donald Trump's trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st state"", The Globe and Mail wrote.
Carney has promised to uphold Canada's reciprocal tariffs, if Trump maintains 25% universal tariffs on Canadian goods not covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) trade deal.
Trump has vowed to impose a sweeping range of tariffs on 2 April on top of the 25% tariffs already imposed on Canada's steel and aluminium.
The race will likely come down to a choice between Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.

BBC News","The Trump administration said it was suspending $175m (£135m) in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over the school's policy regarding transgender athletes.
The move relates to a transgender woman who won the highest US national college swimming title in 2022 while competing for the Ivy League university, which is based in Philadelphia.
A statement from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) on Wednesday said it was ""aware of media reports suggesting"" that the funds have been suspended but that it has ""not yet received any official notification or any details"".
It comes as Trump aims to crack down on transgender athletes participating in sports and to cut federal spending.
""UPenn infamously permitted a male to compete on its women's swimming team, overturning multiple records hard-earned by women, and granting the fully intact male access to the locker room,"" an unnamed Trump official said in an email sent to reporters on Wednesday.
The funding was being provided by the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services, the official said.
The university said in its statement that it has always followed the rules published by the NCAA, which governs university sports.
Last month, the NCAA changed its policy to say that only ""student-athletes assigned female at birth"" will be allowed to take part in collegiate competitions.
The policy change came a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order preventing transgender women from competing in female categories of sports.
The same order guided the federal education department to investigate schools that did not comply and that were possibly in violation of Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools.
Soon after, the department announced an investigation into schools, including UPenn ""for suspected Title IX violations"". The funding freeze is separate from this investigation, however.
The freeze, which was announced on a White House social media account, comes years after transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who competed on the UPenn men's team for three seasons before starting hormone replacement therapy in spring 2019.
Competing on the women's swim team in 2022, she shattered school swim records, posting the fastest times of any female swimmer. She has since graduated and no longer competes for the university.
Ms Thomas has not commented about the funding cut. She previously has defended transgender women in sports and said it did not ""threaten women's sports as a whole"".
She also has noted the transgender population of college athletes is ""very small"". The NCAA has said it amounted to about 10 athletes.
""The biggest misconception, I think, is the reason I transitioned,"" Thomas told ABC and ESPN in 2022. ""People will say, 'Oh, she just transitioned so she would have an advantage, so she could win.' I transitioned to be happy, to be true to myself.""
Last month, three former UPenn swimmers filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify her records.
Trump also made the decision earlier this month to block $400m in federal funding to Columbia University, over claims that it has tolerated antisemitism on campus. The school has been home to Gaza protests over the war between Israel and Hamas.
The White House has also moved to pull funding from the University of Maine after alleging that it violated federal law by permitted transgender students to compete on women's sports teams.
UPenn receives more than $1bn in federal funding each year, according to the Daily Pennsylvanian student newspaper.

BBC News","A North Dakota jury has found Greenpeace liable for defamation, ordering it to pay more than $660m (£507m) in damages to an oil company for the environmental group's role in one of the largest anti-fossil fuel protests in US history.
Texas-based Energy Transfer also accused Greenpeace of trespass, nuisance and civil conspiracy over the demonstrations nearly a decade ago against the Dakota Access Pipeline.
The lawsuit, filed in state court, argued that Greenpeace was behind an ""unlawful and violent scheme to cause financial harm to Energy Transfer"".
Greenpeace, which vowed to appeal, said last month it could be forced into bankruptcy because of the case, ending over 50 years of activism.
Protests against the pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation drew thousands, but Greenpeace argued it did not lead the demonstration and that the lawsuit threatened free speech. Instead, it said the protests were led by local indigenous leaders who were opposed to the pipeline.
The nine-person jury reached a verdict on Wednesday after about two days of deliberating.
The case was heard at a court in Mandan, about 100 miles (160km) north of where the protests took place.
Trey Cox, a lawyer for Energy Transfer, said during closing arguments that Greenpeace's actions caused between $265m to $340m in damages. He asked the jury to award the company that amount, plus additional damages.
Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline gained international attention during President Donald Trump's first term, as Native American groups set up an encampment trying to block it from passing near Standing Rock.
The protests, which saw acts of violence and vandalism, started in April 2016 and ended in February 2017, when the National Guard and police cleared away the demonstrators.
At the peak, over 10,000 protesters were on site. The group included more than 200 Native American tribes, hundreds of US military veterans, actors and political leaders - including current US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr.
The 1,172-mile pipeline has been operating since 2017. However, it still lacks a key permit to operate under Lake Oahe in South Dakota, and local tribes have pushed for an extensive environmental review of the project.
During the three-week trial, jurors heard from Energy Transfer's co-founder and board chairman Kelcy Warren, who said in a video deposition that protesters had created ""a total false narrative"" about his company.
""It was time to fight back,"" he said.
Energy Transfer's lawyer Mr Cox told the court that Greenpeace had exploited the Dakota Access Pipeline to ""promote its own selfish agenda"".
Attorneys for Greenpeace argued that the group did not lead the protests, but merely helped support ""nonviolent, direct-action training"".
In response to the verdict, Greenpeace International's general counsel Kristin Casper said ""Energy Transfer hasn't heard the last of us in this fight"".
""We will not back down, we will not be silenced,"" she said.
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said he believes ""the verdict's magnitude will have a chilling effect on environmental and other public interest litigation"".
""It may encourage litigants in other states to file similar lawsuits,"" he told the BBC.
Energy Transfer's legal action named Greenpeace USA, as well as its Washington DC-based funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc and its Amsterdam-based parent group Greenpeace International.
Greenpeace has counter-sued Energy Transfer in Dutch court, claiming the oil firm is attempting to unfairly use the legal system to silence critics.

BBC News","A Hollywood director has been arrested and accused of using studio funds intended to complete a sci-fi series to buy luxury cars, cryptocurrency and fancy bedding for himself.
Carl Erik Rinsch, 47, is charged with federal fraud and money laundering related to $11m (£8.5m) he was given by Netflix to create a series called White Horse.
Mr Rinsch, who is best known for the 2013 film 47 Ronin, declined to enter a plea when appearing in a Los Angeles court on Tuesday.
The indictment does not name Netflix, referring to a ""subscription video on-demand streaming service"", but Mr Rinsch's long-running dispute with Netflix over the failed series has been previously publicised in US media reports.
Netflix has declined to comment on his arrest.
Between 2018 to 2019, the streaming giant gave Mr Rinsch an initial budget of $44m to film the show, which depicts artificial human clones, but he allegedly never completed a single episode.
In March 2020, Netflix sent him another $11m after he argued that the initial budget was ""not sufficient"", according to prosecutors.
But instead of using the funds for the series, he allegedly transferred them to his personal bank accounts and used it to invest in several risky financial ventures, the US Justice Department said.
""Carl Erik Rinsch orchestrated a scheme to steal millions by soliciting a large investment from a video streaming service, claiming that money would be used to finance a television show that he was creating,"" prosecutor Matthew Podolsky said in a statement on Tuesday.
""But that was fiction.""
Only two months after receiving the $11m, about half of it had already been spent, the indictment says.
While he ""was in the process of losing"" the money, Mr Rinsch allegedly informed Netflix that the show was ""awesome and moving forward really well"", according to the indictment.
He allegedly used the remaining funds to speculate on cryptocurrency, and on personal expenses and luxury items for himself, including a fleet of Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari, court documents state.
The spending spree also included $1.8m for credit card bills, $3.7m on furniture and antiques and $933,000 on mattresses and luxury bedding, the Justice Department states.
The indictment also alleges that $1m of the cash was sent to lawyers to sue Netflix in hopes of receiving more funds, and for a divorce.
A profile of the dispute published by the New York Times in 2023 reported that friends and colleagues had described Mr Rinsch of growing increasingly erratic shortly after he signed the Netflix deal.
The newspaper reports that he believed he could predict lightning strikes and volcanic eruptions and knew about a ""secret transmission mechanism"" for Covid-19.
According to the Associated Press, Mr Rinsch made an initial court appearance on Tuesday. When asked by the judge whether he had read the 12-page indictment, he reportedly responded, ""Not cover to cover"".
He was released on a $100,000 bail, and he is expected to attend trial in New York at a later date. If found guilty, he faces 20 years in prison.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwygldgjkgyo,Judge orders Mahmoud Khalil's case transferred from Louisiana to New Jersey,2025-03-19T21:38:57.670Z,,"A US court has rejected the Trump administration's bid to dismiss Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil's legal challenge to his detention and has ordered the case transferred to New Jersey.
Mr Khalil, a US permanent resident and Columbia University graduate, was detained on 8 March by immigration officers and faces deportation for his role in 2024 campus protests against the war in Gaza.
His legal team had pushed to bring him back from a detention centre in Louisiana where he was sent after his arrest in New York.
In a letter from his detention facility on Tuesday, Mr Khalil described himself as a ""political prisoner"" targeted for ""exercising my right to free speech"".
Mr Khalil's arrest has been linked to President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of ""un-American activity"".
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained him at his university-owned Manhattan apartment and initially placed him in a New Jersey immigration facility before transferring him to a detention centre in Jena, Louisiana, according to ICE records.
The Trump administration had asked the New York court to dismiss Mr Khalil's challenge or move it to Louisiana, home to one of the nation's most conservative appellate courts.
Rejecting the administration's bid on Wednesday, District Judge Jesse Furman ruled that, since the district of New Jersey was ""the one and only district in which Khalil could have filed his petition"" seeking his release from detention, the case must be transferred there rather than Louisiana.
The judge also upheld his 10 March order barring Mr Khalil's deportation while the case continues, but did not rule on his lawyers' request for immediate release.
The US justice department has not commented on the ruling.
Mr Khalil's lawyer Samah Sisay said in a statement on Wednesday that the government moved him to Louisiana to avoid having the case heard in New York or New Jersey.
""Mr Khalil should be free and home with his wife awaiting the birth of their first child, and we will continue to do everything possible to make that happen,"" Ms Sisay told Reuters.
Mr Khalil's wife, who is a US citizen, is eight months pregnant.
His lawyers have argued that he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of ""open repression of student activism and political speech"".
Trump has previously stated that foreign students found to be ""terrorist sympathisers"" would face deportation.
Mr Khalil has not been charged with any crime.
On Wednesday, Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said the administration believes ""that any foreign nationals visiting our country are prohibited from supporting any designated terrorist organization"" such as Hamas.
Meanwhile, another case has roiled immigration activists after the arrest of Jeanette Vizguerra, an undocumented woman in Denver who made national headlines during President Trump's first term.
She was scheduled for deportation in 2017 but took shelter in a church basement in Denver, hoping she would be protected at a house of worship. She was later granted a one-year-stay from deportation by the Biden administration in 2021.
She moved to the US, without proper documentation, from Mexico City in 1997, and she has been considered a voice for the immigrant community for more than two decades.
Ms Vizguerra was taken into custody on Monday morning by federal agents outside a Target store where she worked, CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US, reported.
Reports of her detention stirred a criticism from Democrats and immigrant-rights supporters, who gathered to protest outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the Denver suburb of Aurora on Tuesday morning.
Mayor Mike Johnston of Denver called her arrest a ""Putin-style persecution of political dissidents"" under the guise of immigration enforcement.
""This a mom of American citizens who works at Target. This is not something that makes our community safer,"" he added.
Confirming her arrest in a statement to CBS News, ICE said Ms Vizguerra has two misdemeanour convictions.
""Vizguerra is a convicted criminal alien from Mexico who has a final order of deportation issued by a federal immigration judge,"" the statement said. ""She illegally entered the United States near El Paso, Texas, on Dec. 24, 1997, and has received legal due process in U.S. immigration court.""

BBC News","US President Donald Trump's administration is working to bring back nearly 25,000 fired federal workers after judges ruled their terminations were illegal, court documents show.
Officials at 18 departments and agencies have submitted documents to a federal court detailing their efforts to rehire the laid off probationary workers to comply with the court orders.
Last week, two federal judges said the mass layoffs of the recently hired workers was illegal and ordered them to be reinstated pending further litigation.
The firings were part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, assisted by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
The filings made in a Baltimore federal court on Monday paint a clearer picture of the scale of layoffs across the federal government.
They reveal that 7,600 people had been laid off from the Treasury Department, 5,700 from the Department of Agriculture, more than 3,200 from the Department of Health and Human Services, and hundreds from other departments and agencies.
Many of the reinstated workers will not be heading straight back to work; they will instead be placed on administrative leave.
On 13 March, Judge James Bredar of Maryland and Judge William Alsup of California ordered the agencies to rehire thousands of fired probationary workers.
Judge Bredar's ruling did not stop the agencies from firing the workers, but took issue with the manner in which it was done.
His decision came after a lawsuit was brought by 19 Democratic-led states and Washington DC, which argued that mass layoffs would trigger a rise in unemployment claims and add pressure on social services.
In a later response to the government's efforts to reinstate the workers, the judge said the agencies had made ""meaningful progress toward compliance"".
Separately, Judge Alsup criticised the decision to place the rehired workers on administrative leave, telling government lawyers that it ""would not restore the services the preliminary injunction intends to restore"".
In response, the justice department said in its filings that placing workers on administrative leave was the first step towards fully reinstating them.
The department has appealed both federal court decisions.
These are not the only rulings against the US government's effort to reduce the size of the bureaucracy.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmjpdldnpwo,"As cases climb in the US, do you need another measles shot?",2025-03-19T15:30:32.758Z,"Madeline Halpert
BBC News","Debra Eichenbaum got her two young children vaccinated against the measles virus 20 years ago, and - like millions of other parents - hadn't thought about the highly contagious disease since.
But when cases across the US began to climb this year, the 62-year-old began to worry about how best to protect her husband, David, who is immunocompromised after surviving pancreatic cancer.
So she got another measles shot, and emailed friends her age, encouraging them to check with their doctors to make sure they were still immunised.
""There's no downside to it,"" she said. ""For me, that was a no-brainer.""
Ms Eichenbaum is just one adult who debated an extra shot when cases spiked across the US. Others are thinking about their children, who may not yet have been immunised against the virus.
""There is a lot of confusion out there right now, especially in light of differences in how different age groups of the population have been vaccinated based on what the recommendations were at the time of their vaccination,"" said Donald Dumford III, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic.
The US declared it had eliminated measles from the country in 2000, after decades of access to a safe and effective vaccine. But since the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase in vaccine scepticism, the number of measles outbreaks has risen.
There have been over 300 cases in 2025 across more than a dozen states. This year, the US saw the first measles death in a decade: a 6-year-old girl in western Texas, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread to neighbouring New Mexico and Oklahoma.
Measles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly.
Vaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases that exists, spreading very easily if people are unprotected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine-sceptic, has sent mixed messages about the outbreak, at times encouraging people to talk to their doctor about vaccines, and at other moments, promoting alternative treatments not recommended by public health experts.
The federal government has not offered any guidance about whether certain adults should talk to their doctor about getting another shot - or whether parents in hotspots should consider getting their young children vaccinated sooner.
Asked for comment, the US Department of Health and Human Services referred the BBC to existing measles vaccine guidance from the CDC.
Ms Eichenbaum decided on another measles vaccine over concerns that some people vaccinated in the 1960s may have received a less effective dose.
Those vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have received what is known as an inactivated measles vaccine, and should consider getting an additional shot, said Melissa Stockwell, a professor of paediatrics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.
Those who are unsure about their vaccination status can either search for their written vaccination records or have their antibody levels checked with a blood test, doctors say.
Adults born earlier than 1957 likely had measles as a child and are considered immune, Dr Stockwell said.
""The recommendation is that anyone who does not have presumptive immunity should be vaccinated,"" she said.
For weeks before his new baby was born, Kyle Rable and his pregnant wife exchanged anxious messages throughout the day, wondering how they could best keep their future son safe from measles.
""It's basically both of our constant thoughts all the time,"" said Mr Rable, whose wife gave birth to their son, Steven, earlier this month in the same hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where a child died of measles just a week before.
The outbreak in western Texas has raised the alarm for parents across the state and in the wider region, especially those who have young babies who cannot yet be immunised.
The measles vaccine is not generally recommended for children who are under a year old because the shots do not work as well before that age, doctors say.
It is a two-dose vaccine. Typically, children are given their first shot between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and then another between ages 4 and 6.
But for young children who live near a measles outbreak, paediatricians may recommend a shot at an earlier age, between six and 11 months, said Stuart Ray, professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
Mr Rable plans to ask about vaccination plans at his son's two-week checkup, and will ""100%"" vaccinate his child early if the doctor recommends it.
Children vaccinated before they are a year old still need two additional standard doses of the measles vaccine later on, Dr Ray said.
""There's no harm in getting the additional doses,"" said Tony Moody, a paediatrics professor at Duke University School of Medicine. ""The decision about getting an early MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) should be a conversation between the family and their paediatrician.""
Children can get a second dose as soon as 28 days after their first shot.
""The vaccine starts providing some protection within weeks of the first dose,"" Dr Ray said.
Parents hoping to get their children vaccinated against measles, or adults looking for another dose, can make an appointment at a pharmacy.
However, some pharmacies - especially in Texas, the epicentre of the outbreak - have seen vaccine shortages because of higher demand.
The CDC has provided thousands of doses to the state.
Local health departments in western Texas also are holding vaccination clinics, while many across the US offer the shot free of charge.",US & Canada

BBC News","The US government has released the final batch of documents on the assassination of President John F Kennedy (JFK) - a case that still inspires conspiracy theories more than 60 years later.
It follows an executive order by President Donald Trump that required remaining unredacted files in the case to be made public.
Experts are combing over the papers, not all of which have appeared online. They say the job will take time, and that they do not expect many ground-breaking revelations.
US authorities have previously released hundreds of thousands of JFK documents, but held some back, citing national security concerns. Many Americans still believe the gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not act alone.
Kennedy was shot during a visit to Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963.
Trump said beforehand that 80,000 pages would be unsealed.
Of the 1,123 documents included in Tuesday's release from the National Archives and Records Administration, it was not immediately clear how much material was new. Many documents have previously been released in partially redacted form.
""You got a lot of reading,"" Trump told reporters on Monday, previewing the release. ""I don't believe we're going to redact anything.""
But some of the hundreds of files unsealed on Tuesday night did appear to have passages blacked out. Others were hard to read, because they were faded or were poorly scanned photocopies, or appeared to bear little relevance to the JFK case, specialists said.
Non-scholars would probably be ""baffled"", commented David Barrett of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, as he reviewed the released material on Tuesday.
Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, he said the release was ""useful"", but he was not expecting ""earth-shaking information, either with regard to the assassination or more broadly"".
Other JFK experts suggested the American public might keep wondering about the possible existence of other documents and information.
""I think there may continue to be more record releases,"" historian Alice George told Reuters. But she went on to say the passage of time made investigations hard: ""It's much harder to find the truth when most of the people involved are dead.""
A government commission in the aftermath of the killing determined that President Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, a Marine veteran and self-described Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union and later returned to the US.
Opinion polls over decades have indicated that most Americans don't believe Oswald was the sole assassin. But no clear alternative narrative is yet to emerge from the latest batch of unsealed documents.
Unanswered questions have long dogged the case, giving rise to theories about the involvement of government agents, the mafia and other nefarious characters - as well as more outlandish claims.
In 1992, Congress passed a law to release all documents related to the investigation within 25 years.
Both Trump, in his first term, and President Joe Biden released piles of JFK-related documents - but thousands remained partially or fully secret.
Trump's executive order two months ago also called on government archivists to release files related to the killings of presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, both of whom were gunned down in 1968.
His announcement on Monday that the document release was imminent came as a surprise to his national security team, which had been working since January to prepare the files by removing redactions, according to US media reports.
The Republican president vowed during last year's White House race to release JFK files, shortly after he secured the endorsement of Robert F Kennedy Jr (RFK Jr), the nephew of JFK and son of Robert F Kennedy.
RFK Jr has gone on to become Trump's health secretary. He is among those who have promoted conspiracy theories about the assassination of his uncle. He was yet to comment on Tuesday's release of documents.
Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said of the release: ""President Trump is ushering in a new era of maximum transparency.""",US & Canada

BBC News","A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from taking any further steps to shut down the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
In a ruling Tuesday, Judge Theodore Chuang said the efforts led by Trump ally Elon Musk's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) to close the agency likely violated the US constitution ""in multiple ways"".
Chuang ordered Doge to restore access to USAID's computer and payment systems for employees, including those who were placed on leave.
The judge also ruled that termination of USAID employees should stop, but did not order the reinstating of employees previously placed on leave.
The ruling came in a case brought on behalf of 26 unnamed USAID employees who allege in court filings that Musk is following ""a predictable and reckless slash-and-burn pattern"" in dismantling US government departments.
In a complaint filed on 13 February, lawyers for the employees argued that Musk's power is illegitimate - as he has not been officially nominated to a government post nor confirmed by the US Senate - and asked for Doge's activities to be halted and reversed.
USAID was one of the first agencies targeted by Doge for cuts shortly after Trump re-entered the White House in January and ordered a 90-day freeze of all US foreign aid.
Musk and Doge argued in court documents that Musk's role is advisory only.
But Judge Chuang ruled that Musk and Doge exerted control over USAID and in doing so ""likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways, and that these actions harmed not only plaintiffs, but also the public interest.""
It's unclear what effect the ruling will have on USAID operations. Administration officials have said that more than 80% of its activities have been halted.
The Trump administration criticised Tuesday's ruling.
""Rogue judges are subverting the will of the American people in their attempts to stop President Trump from carrying out his agenda,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said, calling the decision a ""miscarriage of justice"" and vowing to appeal.
Norm Eisen, executive chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund which represented the USAID employees, called the ruling ""a milestone in pushing back on Musk and Doge's illegality"".
""They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,"" Eisen said.
The ruling is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration. On Monday, another federal judge ordered a halt to the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members.
The judge in that case questioned Department of Justice lawyers about why his order, issued when several deportation flights were in the air, was not immediately implemented and followed.

BBC News","The chief justice of the US Supreme Court has released a rare statement in response to President Donald Trump's call to impeach a judge who ruled against his administration over migrant deportations.
""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement.
He added that the ""normal appellate review process exists for that purpose"".
Trump earlier referred to US District Judge James Boasberg as a ""troublemaker and agitator"" after he ordered the administration to halt deportations of accused gang members to El Salvador.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Justice Roberts, who leads the Supreme Court, rarely issues public statements on political matters.
The conservative jurist wrote the majority opinion in Trump's presidential immunity case last year.
His statement comes as Trump escalates attacks on the federal judges who have halted or ruled against many of his early actions as president.
Trump posted on Truth Social earlier on Tuesday, in which he attacked Judge Boasberg and said he should be impeached. ""HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!"" he wrote. ""I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do.""
Removing a federal judge in an impeachment process would require the US House of Representatives to formally vote on articles of impeachment, and for two thirds of the US Senate to then vote for conviction.
The US Senate has considered the impeachments of 15 judges - including one US Supreme Court Justice - since the country's founding. Of those, eight were found guilty in a US Senate trial.
Trump appeared to be responding to Judge Boasberg's order that required the Trump administration to halt the deportations to El Salvador of more than 200 Venezuelans alleged by the White House to be gang members.
After lawyers told the judge that planes with deportees already had taken off, he reportedly gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back ""immediately"", although that directive was not included in a written ruling published shortly thereafter.
Judge Boasberg called an additional hearing on Monday to question the Trump administration's lawyers about why the flights had not returned to the US.
In the meantime, government lawyers said that the deportations had been paused. The Trump administration also asked in a court motion that Boasberg be removed from the case.
Trump has attacked judges in the past, frequently targeting those who oversaw his criminal and civil cases before he returned to the White House.
Since becoming president, he has criticised many of the judges who have blocked his administration's policies and has joined some of his political allies - such as tech billionaire Elon Musk - in calling for their impeachment.
The president has also praised judges that he has viewed as favourable towards him. He has often complimented US District Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw and ultimately dismissed his criminal case over alleged mishandling of classified documents.
Since Justice Roberts backed Trump's presidential immunity challenge, the president has also acted warmly towards the Supreme Court judge.
The ruling held that presidents had immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, greatly expanding the power of the presidency. The decision also gave Trump additional leverage in the four simultaneous criminal cases he faced in 2024, only one of which went to trial and resulted in a conviction.
At Trump's January inauguration, Roberts administered the oath of office, and Trump shook his hand and pointed at him.
Trump also appeared to personally thank Roberts at his 4 March address to Congress.
Though the Supreme Court justices have ideological leanings ranging from liberal to conservative, members attempt to maintain a distance from partisan politics.
Roberts' statement was a rare rebuttal to a political statement made by a president about the role of the judicial system.

So what has life been like for the Nasa astronauts orbiting 250 miles (400km) above us, and how have they passed the time?
Of course there was a lot of serious space stuff to keep them occupied.
Suni, 59, and Butch, 62, have been helping ongoing missions at the station with maintenance and experiments, and have conducted spacewalks.
Suni ventured outside in mid-January with fellow astronaut Nick Hague to perform repairs on the craft. She and Butch went out together later in the month.
Their tasks included repairing equipment that governs station orientation, adding light filters on the NICER X-ray telescope, and replacing a reflector device on an international docking adapter.
Butch and Suni have taken the situation in their stride, saying in a news conference in September that they have been trained to ""expect the unexpected"".
They have definitely had opportunities for reflection about life back home - and for watching a lot of sunrises and sunsets.
As the space station makes 16 orbits of Earth every 24 hours, it travels through 16 sunrises and sunsets, treating those on board to a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes.
Living with such a unique view of the Earth gives plenty of room for contemplating it, something Suni has acknowledged.
""It opens up the door to making you think a bit differently. It's the one planet we have and we should be taking care of it,"" she said.
""There are so many people on Earth sending us messages it makes you feel right at home with everybody.""
Butch and Suni and the two other Americans who were on board with them, Don Pettit and Nick Hague, each had the opportunity to vote in last year's US election.
""It's a very important duty that we have as citizens,"" Suni said to reporters.
Butch said Nasa had made it ""very easy"" for them to be included in elections.
To facilitate their voting, the Mission Control Center in Houston sent ballot papers via encrypted email to the ISS.
The astronauts then filled them out and transmitted them to satellites which relayed them to a ground terminal in New Mexico.
From there, landlines transmitted the ballots to Mission Control, who then electronically sent them to the astronauts' county clerks for filing.
For Butch, the day starts at 04:30, and as for Suni, she makes a slightly kinder 06:30 start.
Both have said they enjoy the two hours or more of exercise they must do daily to combat the loss of bone density from living in space.
""Your joints don't hurt, which is quite nice,"" Butch has said.
Three different machines help to counter the effect of living in zero gravity.
The Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is used for squats, deadlifts, and rows that work all the muscle groups. For treadmills crews must strap in to stop themselves floating away, and there is also a cycle ergometer for endurance training.
At Christmas, astronauts on the International Space Station posted a festive message in which they wished their friends and family on Earth a merry Christmas.
The team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers, throwing the slowly gyrating microphone to each other to speak while candy canes floated around their heads.
It was a chance for the crew to let their hair down, though in Suni's case it was more a case of letting it 'up'. Zero gravity has given her a style that would take a lot of product to achieve on Earth.
One of Butch and Suni's final duties on board the ISS was to make their replacements feel welcome.
On 16 March a SpaceX capsule carrying a new crew arrived at the ISS. It was a deeply significant event for Butch and Suni, as it paved the way for them to come home.
Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin.
On Tuesday, they finally undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT).",US & Canada

BBC News","A midwife in Texas has been arrested for allegedly providing illegal abortions and operating a network of unlawful clinics in the Houston area.
Maria Margarita Rojas has been charged with providing an abortion and practising medicine without a licence, according to the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.
Authorities accused Ms Rojas, 48, of operating multiple clinics in Houston where she allegedly performed illegal abortions in her clinic, violating the state's restrictive abortion laws.
Ms Rojas faces second-degree felony charges, which carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $10,000 (£7,700) if convicted.
Under the Texas Human Life Protection Act - a 2021 law that bans abortion in most cases - state authorities can also fine Ms Rojas at least $100,000 ""per violation"".
In a news release on Monday announcing the arrest, Attorney General Paxton said that ""Texas law protecting life is clear, and we will hold those who violate it accountable"".
""I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individuals endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,"" Paxton said.
He added that Texas law holds abortion providers, not patients, ""criminally responsible"" for unlawful procedures.
In Texas, physicians are barred from performing an abortion once a foetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks into a pregnancy - before many realise they are pregnant. There are exceptions if the life or health of the pregnant patient is at risk, but not in cases of rape or incest.
The state's supreme court unanimously rejected a challenge last year from 20 women who said they were denied medically necessary abortions under Texas law.
Paxton's office said Ms Rojas, who they allege is known as ""Dr Maria"", operated multiple clinics in north-west Houston.
She employed ""unlicensed individuals"" and performed ""illegal abortion procedures"", according to the allegations.
Authorities said they have filed a temporary restraining order to shut down the clinics.
Holly Shearman, a midwife who runs a birth centre where Ms Rojas worked part-time, told the Texas Tribune that she was ""shocked"" by news of the arrest.
According to the Texas-based news website, Ms Shearman said Ms Rojas was a devout Catholic who provided prenatal care to a primarily Spanish-speaking, low-income community.
""I don't believe it for one second,"" she said of the allegations.
Ms Rojas' arrest is believed to be one of the first criminal prosecutions under the Texas abortion ban. The state attorney general's office said she was taken into custody in Waller County, and it is unclear if she has a lawyer yet.
Last year, Paxton's office filed a lawsuit against a New York-based abortion provider for allegedly posting abortion pills to a Texan. That same doctor was indicted earlier this year in the state on a charge of criminal abortion.
New York has shield laws, which aim to protect providers who provide abortion to patients in other states. New York Gov Kathy Hochul has said the state has no plans to allow for Dr Margaret Daley Carpenter's extradition to Texas.
She called the case ""outrageous"" and said Republicans were trying to stymie access to abortion across the US.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2g1xvzg4ko,Police release new evidence in timeline of Hackman and his wife's death,2025-03-17T22:19:26.983Z,"Samantha Granville
BBC News, Los Angeles","Authorities have discovered new information changing the timeline of when they believe Academy Award winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, died.
The couple were found dead in their New Mexico home last month with officials saying the pair had been dead for some time before they were discovered by neighbourhood security.
Officials initially said they believed Arakawa died on 11 February and Hackman died one week later.
The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office now says they have confirmed that Arakawa made multiple calls to a health clinic on 12 February for medical treatment, which the clinic told BBC she never was able to receive.
The sheriff's office said they learned of the calls when they received cell phone data from her phone.
They said there were three calls made that morning to Cloudberry Health, a personalized concierge medical practice in the area. She received a fourth call, also from the clinic.
The sheriff's office noted it never reported an official date of death for her and said that initially they'd stated that Arakawa's last known activity was on 11 February. Authorities say she'd exchanged emails with a massage therapist and visited a grocery store, pharmacy and a pet store. Garage clicker data showed she returned home around 5:15 p.m. that day.
Dr Josiah Child, who leads Cloudberry Health, told the BBC that while the clinic had never treated Hackman or Arakawa, she had reached out for medical advice.
""She called and described some congestion but didn't mention any respiratory distress, shortness of breath, or chest pain,"" he said.
Arakawa initially had scheduled an appointment for 12 February but cancelled on 10 February, explaining that she needed to care for her husband, Dr Child said.
On the morning of 12 February, she called again seeking treatment but because no doctor-patient relationship had been established, the clinic told her she needed to be seen in person.
""There were a couple calls back and forth to just schedule that appointment for the afternoon, but she never showed up,"" Dr Child explained. ""Our office called back several times and never got an answer.""
The couple were both found dead on 26 February.
Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell stated that ""based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that [Betsy] passed away first.""
The Santa Fe medical examiner determined she died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne respiratory disease.
Authorities believe Hackman died on 18 February - the date of his last recorded pacemaker activity, which showed an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation.
His cause of death was severe heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease listed as a contributing factor. Experts believe his Alzheimer's may have prevented him from realising his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.
If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.
A necropsy report also revealed that one of the couple's three dogs, which had been crated while recovering from surgery, died from starvation and dehydration.
As the investigation continues, representatives for Hackman and Arakawa's estate have taken legal action to block the release of body camera footage and other visual evidence from their home when their remains were discovered.
A New Mexico judge has issued a temporary restraining order that prevents their release, with a hearing set for March 31.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78el01zd03o,King meets Carney in symbolic support for Canada,2025-03-17T21:16:58.995Z,"Sean Coughlan
Royal correspondent","King Charles gave a warm welcome to the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney when he visited Buckingham Palace.
It was another symbolic gesture of support for Canada from a King, wearing a red tie, who has to send coded signals rather than spell things out in words, as Canada faces threats from US President Donald Trump.
But the King has sought to make clear his commitment to Canada - and if it had not been for his cancer diagnosis, the BBC understands he would have travelled there for an intended visit in 2024.
There are also suggestions that once Canada's election is out the way, a visit to Canada will be a priority, where he can further demonstrate his support.
The new Canadian prime minister told the King that his Order of Canada pin had broken this morning. The King joked: ""Do you want mine?""
The King congratulated Carney on becoming the new PM, ushering him to a seat, and perhaps hoping that the broken pin was not a symbol of a Commonwealth relationship under strain.
""These things are rather important,"" said the King, ahead of a 30-minute conversation with no one else in attendance.
Carney later went on to meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer at Downing Street.
Sir Keir hailed the relationship between the two countries and said they had ""so much in common - shared history, shared values, shared King.""
Carney said he was ""grateful for the welcomes and the constructive discussions"" with Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron - whom he had met earlier in the day.
At a news conference, he was asked if he felt let down by the lack of public support for Canada from other allies, given Trump's trade war with Canada, and his remarks about making Canada the 51st state of the US.
""We don't need another country to validate our sovereignty, we are sovereign, we don't need praise from another country, we are proud in and of ourselves,"" he said, adding that Sir Keir had made a point of referring to Canada's sovereignty and to ""our shared sovereign in King Charles III.""
The meeting with Carney is the latest scene in an intricate diplomatic balancing act for a King who is head of state of both the UK and Canada.
King Charles has to show solidarity with Canada without disrupting the UK's relationship with Trump.
The King also has to avoid getting directly involved in politics - and has to speak on advice of ministers. Whatever he might personally believe about Trump's comments about taking over Canada, the King has to keep his thoughts to himself.
Adding to this complicated choreography is that the royals are one of the strongest cards the UK can play with President Trump. He seemed delighted by his second state visit invitation from the King.
So messages from the King are sent in symbolic displays. In case anyone missed the signs over Canada, there have been multiple moments. And then some more.
When the King visited aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, he appeared wearing a set of Canadian medals.
The 60th anniversary of Canada's maple leaf flag might usually have passed without any royal intervention, but there was a fulsome message sent by the King, praising the ""proud, resilient and compassionate country"".
A ceremonial sword for Canada became an event at Buckingham Palace with a formal presentation by the King.
At a tree planting ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the tree chosen was a maple. And when the King sat down at the Commonwealth Service last week, it was on a Canadian chair.
If any of these moments were accidental, they were not being rejected by Buckingham Palace, with royal sources emphasising the King's commitment to Canada.
But there is no avoiding the tensions and contradictions in this balancing act. Emails from Canadians to the BBC's Royal Watch newsletter show that many want a much more robust defence from the King.
""What a cop out! Throw Canada to the wolves. Giving us back pats for our flag's anniversary doesn't quite cut it. Here sits a monarchist who is seriously rethinking his allegiance to the crown!"" emailed Brian, a Canadian military veteran.
Carol in Vancouver was unhappy at the invitation from the UK for a second state visit by President Trump.
""I feel ashamed for the Brits feeling they have to follow through with inviting such a boor for dinner. For the life of me I do not understand why he has this power over you,"" she wrote.
""As a Canadian, the invitation is a slap in the face to the people of Canada. If the King is our King (as we are a Commonwealth country), and Trump is basically at war with us, how dare King Charles give him any credence?"" emailed Patricia.
""As a Canadian I am saddened, appalled, disgusted and angry that King Charles appears to be joining the conga line of supplicants,"" said Jo-Ann in Ontario.
But King Charles will have to keep to the line set by ministers, and if that means maintaining good relations with Trump, he is unlikely to be saying anything more outspoken.

BBC Verify","President Trump has said ""many"" pardons issued by Joe Biden are void because the former president signed them with ""autopen"" - a device which reproduces a person's signature - rather than by hand.
Trump did not provide evidence for his claim - which was posted on Truth Social.
BBC Verify has found several instances of Biden signing pardons by hand rather than by autopen.
And a sample presidential signature is used on US government documents when they are stored in the Federal Register - a digital archive. This was the case under Trump as well as under Biden.
Legal experts also told us that there is nothing in US law which would invalidate pardons signed by autopen.
On Truth Social, Trump said that: ""The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!"".
Trump didn't specify which pardons he was referring to but he has previously referred to the house select committee investigating the 6 January riots as the ""unselect committee"", and has criticised Biden for pardoning family members.
BBC Verify looked through official photographs of Biden in the White House and ones posted on the official White House X account and found a number of examples of him signing pardons by hand.
In October 2022, Biden was pictured signing an order pardoning those in jail for marijuana possession.
In the same year, he also signed a pardon for non-violent offenders.
It is not known whether Biden has signed any pardons only using autopen.
In May last year, CNN did report that he signed a bill for a one-week extension for federal aviation funding using autopen.
BBC Verify has asked Biden's office for his record of using autopen and the White House for the evidence behind Trump's claim.
Trump appears to have taken his cue from the Oversight Project - part of the Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation - which has claimed that Biden's 19 January pardons - of some family members and political figures including Anthony Fauci - all had the same autopen signature.
We have asked the Heritage Foundation for its workings. Previously, it has highlighted other Biden documents which it says had autopen signatures, along with screenshots taken from the Federal Register.
The register is the official, daily publication of various presidential and other government documents - which all have a standard signature created from a single sample.
A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checking website Snopes that: ""At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register,""
We looked through presidential documents archived by the Federal Register under both Trump administrations and found identical signatures on documents.
That includes Trump's pardons for the 6 January rioters.
Trump had already signed these pardons by hand, as this video showed in January.
Presidential pardons are also published by the US Department of Justice. We have asked it how these documents are archived.
Legal experts who we spoke to told us that there is nothing in US law which says official documents signed by US presidents - including pardons - are not legally binding if they were signed with autopen.
Andrew Moran, a politics professor at London Metropolitan University, says that previous presidents have used autopen before.
""On lower-level importance documents, it's not unusual for an autopen to be used.
""But I would have thought that with something as serious as a pardon Biden would have actually signed it [by hand]"", he said.
A 2005 memo from the Department of Justice during the Bush administration stated that the President does not have to physically sign a bill for it to become law.
""The President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen"", the memo said.
Although George W. Bush did not use autopen himself, President Obama used it in 2011.
Autopen has also been used by earlier presidents including JFK and Harry Truman.
Professor Erin Delaney, director of the Global Centre for Democratic Constitutionalism at UCL, says that an attempt by Trump to rescind Biden's pardons would be a ""violation of unwritten constitutional norms"".
Critically, he would not be able to pursue this action without prosecuting, or re-prosecuting the individuals who were given immunity, she argues.
Legally challenging Biden's pardons because of autopen would also call into question other aspects of US governance that use automatic signatures, such as bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, she added.
Professor Moran says that a president revoking his predecessor's pardon is extremely rare.
""Historically, the only example I'm aware of is towards the end of Andrew Johnson's presidency in the 1860s, when he issued some pardons which were revoked before they were accepted. But that's a very small number.
""If he [Trump] decides that he wants to go after the people who were pardoned, that will end up in the courts and then that would become the point where the constitution is really tested"", he said.

BBC News, Toronto","The remains of two indigenous women murdered by a serial killer have been found after a search of a landfill in the Canadian province of Manitoba, police say.
The remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran were recovered at the Prairie Green Landfill, north of the city of Winnipeg, said officials. Authorities had been searching for the bodies of Ms Harris and Ms Myran, both of Long Plain First Nation.
The two victims were among four indigenous women killed in 2022 by convicted murderer Jeremy Skibicki.
The search of the Prairie Green Landfill began late last year following a lengthy pressure campaign by indigenous leaders.
Ms Myran's remains were officially identified by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Manitoba on Monday, while the remains of Ms Harris were identified earlier this month.
In a news release, the Manitoba government said Ms Myran's family has been notified of the discovery and has asked for privacy.
Cambria Harris, Morgan Harris's daughter, said in a Facebook post earlier this month that the discovery of her mother's remains was a ""very bittersweet moment"".
""Please keep our families in your hearts tonight and every day going forward as we trust this process,"" she said.
Police and province initially declined to search the landfill for the remains of the women, and a federal government study concluded that a search could take three years and cost up to C$184m (£100m; $128m), with workers exposed to hazardous chemicals.
Following pressure from the families and a change in government, Manitoba's new premier, Wab Kinew, eventually pledged C$20m for the search. The funds were matched by the federal government.
The search officially began in December. In late February, search crews recovered human remains, later identified as that of Ms Harris and Ms Myran.
The Manitoba Progressive Conservatives, who had rejected a landfill search when they formed government, issued a formal apology in the legislature to the families this month.
""Our government erred. It's as simple as that,"" said interim PC Leader Wayne Ewasko.
Premier Kinew has said that ""many Canadians always understood that this was the right thing to do to search the landfill"".
""But now, we can also say with confidence, that this was also the realistic and reasonable thing to do,"" he added.
Skibicki was convicted last July of the murders of Ms Harris,39, and Ms Myran,26, as well as of killing a third woman, Rebecca Contois, 24, of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation. A fourth victim is still unidentified, and has been given the name Buffalo Woman.
Their murders went undetected for months until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki's apartment found partial human remains, identified as belonging to Ms Contois.
Canada has long faced a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, indigenous women make up 10% of the population of missing women in Canada and 16% of female homicides. Indigenous women make up about 4% of the female population in Canada.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w13w757lgo,US officials expected to release Prince Harry immigration records,2025-03-17T18:56:44.845Z,"Ali Abbas Ahmadi
BBC News","A US court has ordered that Prince Harry's immigration files must be made public by the end of Tuesday.
District Judge Carl Nichols ordered the release of the documents based on a freedom of information (FOI) request by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative US think tank in Washington DC.
The foundation alleges that the prince concealed his past use of drugs, which should have disqualified him from obtaining a US visa.
The allegations centre around the Duke of Sussex's claims in his memoir Spare, where he referred to taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms.
In the book, published in January 2023, Prince Harry wrote that he first tried cocaine at the age of 17.
""It wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,"" he added.
He also wrote about using marijuana, saying ""cocaine didn't do anything for me"", but ""marijuana is different, that actually really did help me"".
Application forms for US visas specifically ask about current and past drug use.
Admissions of drug use can lead to non-immigrant and immigrant visa applications being rejected, although immigration officers have discretion to make a final decision based on different factors.
The Heritage Foundation alleges that Prince Harry lied about his use of drugs to US immigration authorities, which can lead to a lifetime ban from the United States.
According to court records, the Department of Homeland Security has until the end of Tuesday to comply with the order and release the immigration records.
The BBC has contacted the White House and the duke's office for comment.
The court's ruling comes after a 2024 ruling by the same judge which said that there was not enough public interest in disclosing Prince Harry's immigration records.
The Heritage Foundation contested that ruling and pushed for the judgement to be changed.
Prince Harry moved to the US with his wife Meghan in 2020 after stepping down as a working royal. It is not clear what visa he entered the country on, while the duchess is a US citizen.
President Donald Trump previously ruled out deporting Prince Harry in February, telling the New York Post ""I'll leave him alone... He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.""
Meghan has been a vocal critic of Trump in the past, labelling him a ""misogynist"".",US & Canada

BBC News, New York","Harvard University has announced that it is making tuition free for families who earn less than $200,000 (£154,000) a year.
For families earning less than $100,000, Harvard will also cover expenses like housing and health insurance.
The move is aimed at making Harvard more affordable for middle-income families, and it comes as the Trump administration targets university funding as a part of a crackdown on diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) practices.
""Putting Harvard within financial reach for more individuals widens the array of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that all of our students encounter, fostering their intellectual and personal growth,"" said Harvard President Alan Garber.
The policy - which will begin in the 2025 to 2026 academic year - will help ""make a Harvard College education possible for every admitted student"", Garber added.
The Ivy League school said the move will allow roughly 86% of US families to qualify for Harvard's financial aid.
The median household income in the US was $80,000 in 2023, according to the US Census.
A number of elite universities in the US have taken similar steps in recent years, including the University of Pennsylvania and The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which also have free tuition for families making less than $200,000.
Harvard had previously made all university costs, including housing and medical care, free for families with incomes under $85,000.
The average price of a private university in the US for those living on campus is $58,000 per academic year, according to the Education Data Initiative. The average cost of college has more than doubled since 2001, the research group found.
The financial aid expansions come as the Trump administration has threatened to pull funding from universities over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, research and coursework that they allege is a form of racial discrimination.
Under Trump, the Department of Education has said it is investigating 52 universities across the country for alleged ""racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs and activities"" as Trump attempts to get rid of DEI programmes.
The Trump administration has already pulled $400m in grants and contracts from Columbia University, alleging the Ivy League school failed to prevent antisemitism on campus as protests grew over Israel's war in Gaza.
Last year, the US Supreme Court voted to overturn affirmative action. The practice favoured individuals in disadvantaged groups to help eliminate discrimination against marginalised applicants during the enrollment process and increase diversity among students.

BBC News","At least 40 people have died after tornadoes ripped through a swathe of the US Midwest and South.
Missouri bore the brunt of the twisters, which began to spawn on Friday. At least 12 people have died in that state.
Powerful winds in Texas and Kansas whipped up dust storms that resulted in vehicle pile-ups and a dozen deaths.
The extreme weather, covering an area of the country that is home to more than 100 million people, fanned nearly 150 deadly wildfires in Oklahoma. Fatalities were also recorded in Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi.
Parts of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina were under flood advisories.
More than 320,000 people across the region were without power on Sunday evening, according to tracker PowerOutageUS.
Tens of thousands of people were still without power on Monday morning, including more than 57,000 in Pennsylvania and 25,000 in Missouri.
States of emergency have been declared in Arkansas, Georgia and Oklahoma.
In Missouri, Governor Mike Kehoe said ""the scale of devastation across our state is staggering"".
""Hundreds of homes, schools, and businesses have been either destroyed or severely damaged,"" his statement added.
A tornado killed the occupant of one residence in Butler County in the Midwestern state, leaving it ""unrecognisable as a home"", according to local coroner Jim Akers.
""Just a debris field,"" he added. ""The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.""
In Oklahoma, nearly 150 wildfires driven by winds that hit 83mph (133km/h) toppled several articulated lorries.
The state's chief medical examiner said at least four people had died there as a result of fires or high winds.
The blazes burnt 170,000 acres and destroyed nearly 300 structures, including a farmhouse owned by the state's Governor Kevin Stitt.
In Kansas, at least eight people died after more than 55 vehicles crashed due to a dust storm.
In Texas, another dust storm caused a pile-up of about 38 cars, leaving at least four people dead.
Six people died in Mississippi as tornadoes swept through that state and twisters killed another three in Alabama, including an 82-year-old woman.
In Arkansas, officials reported three deaths and 29 people injured.

Chief international correspondent","Two European politicians, dressed symbolically in red and white, sent a message last week to Canada on social media declaring ""we've got your back"".
Also signalling support was King Charles, who planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and wore his Canadian medals during a high-profile visit to a naval warship.
Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Paris before heading to London on Monday - a day after his 60th birthday - for his first foreign visit hoping to achieve more than symbolic encouragement. He wants solid support from allies.
Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.
""We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,"" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians – Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's ""51st state"".
The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security – a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant ""to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships"".
His itinerary is full of great symbolism too.
Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish - to the origins of this former colony. He hailed ""the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British"".
So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour – Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to ""reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty"".
Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.
And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.
His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.
And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top.
But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.
His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a ""Trump bump"" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.
Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.
""I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,"" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.
Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.
Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors.
Many will be watching to see how Trump addresses Mark Carney - he recently referred to Canada's former prime minister as ""Governor Trudeau"".
Canada's new top talker has been talking tough.
A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. ""Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,"" Carney declared to rousing applause.
""Make no mistake, Canada will win.""
But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as ""the greatest crisis of our lifetime"". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.
And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.
On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.
""The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,"" he remarked. ""Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.""
Carney says he ""looks forward"" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.
On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his ""deepest affection"" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister.
In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.
Sir Keir has described Canada as ""an ally, and a very important ally too"". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the ""shocking attacks"" on its sovereignty.
This may be a week of that old adage in diplomacy and politics – ""to do something and be seen to be doing it"".",US & Canada

Business reporter
Reporting fromToronto","Made in Canada.
Three words that are now a common presence on Canadian shelves, after Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a trade war with the US's northern neighbour.
In Canada the economic measures against it have been met with a wave of patriotism, with some consumers and businesses boycotting American products.
Others with operations in the US face a choice - ride out the uncertainty or bring their enterprise back home.
""Right now, I'm a little angry. I don't want to invest in American companies,"" says Joanna Goodman, owner of Au Lit Fine Linens, a Toronto-based bedding and nightwear company.
""It's about having your eggs in one basket. And right now, that basket is very reckless and very precarious,"" she continues.
On a tour around one of her firm's two stores, housed in a giant warehouse, Ms Goodman highlights elegantly made-up beds, mannequins in silk pyjamas, and shelves full of sweet-smelling candles – most of it made in Canada.
But one fifth of the stock currently comes from the US. Ms Goodman is quick to point out, ""you see how big the store is, so even 20% is a lot"".
""I have a lot of inventory here of American brands that I've had relationships with for 20 years. I'm not going to throw it away,"" she says. ""The question is, will I reorder?""
To show Au Lit Fine Linens' commitment to Canadian manufacturers, its stores now highlight everything that is Canadian made. This is mirrored on its website, which has a ""shop all made in Canada"" section, and says ""made right here at home"".
From Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, to the Ukraine war, global events in recent years have given rise to a more recent phenomenon – reshoring.
Bringing business operations back to home shores, it is the reversal of offshoring.
Business leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is ""really obvious"" to support.
Pupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade ""went right out the window"".
She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.
In that moment Pupatello thought: ""We've got to be prepared for the worst"".
Shortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada.
Pupatello tells the BBC: ""If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it.""
A Canadian government report from last year found that there had ""not been signs of either large-scale or any notable increased reshoring by businesses"", but things could now be changing.
Ray Brougham has been trying to make inroads into the Canadian car manufacturing sector since establishing his company Rainhouse Manufacturing Canada in 2001. Based in British Columbia, it manufactures parts for a number of industries.
The North American car industry's integrated supply chains can see parts crossing the borders between the US, Mexico, and Canada multiple times before a vehicle is finally assembled.
US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March.
But in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had ""good communications"" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. ""All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies.""
For Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods.
Others, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces.
His Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border.
Canada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas.
""We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,"" says Mr Markham.
From critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.
""Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.""
So, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada? Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell.
""There's a lot more smoke than there is fire when it comes to actual reorganisation of supply chains and moving them domestically,"" says Mr Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Quebec-based Desjardins.
""I think there has been some movement toward reshoring, but I think there's a lot more narrative around it than there is actual re-establishing of manufacturing capacity.""
There are major hurdles too.
The highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require ""many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen"", according to Mr Bartlett.
Then there's the reality of global trade.
""Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,"" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.
He says that Canada should focus on ""those industries where we have a comparative advantage"", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.
Back at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed.
""We're shipping orders to the US that came in pre-tariffs,"" she explains, before pausing. ""We did get an order the day of the tariffs starting, and it was a very decent-sized order.""
She says that she doesn't know whether the US buyer understands that tariffs will now apply. ""He has to ask Mr Trump [why]"".
As for what comes next? ""These tariffs could be gone any day. Let's see how it all unfolds, then we'll start making decisions,"" says Ms Goodman.
Like many Canadian businesses, she's waiting for the dust to settle before deciding where to buy, where to sell, and what Made in Canada really means for the future.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge4l109r3o,Trump moves to close down Voice of America,2025-03-16T23:28:03.445Z,"Thomas Mackintosh & Merlyn Thomas
BBC News","US President Donald Trump has signed an order to strip back federally funded news organisation Voice of America, accusing it of being ""anti-Trump"" and ""radical"".
A White House statement said the order would ""ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda"", and included quotes from politicians and right-wing media criticising the broadcaster.
VOA, still primarily a radio service, was set up during World War Two to counter Nazi propaganda. It says it currently reaches hundreds of millions of people globally each week.
Mike Abramowitz, VOA's director, said he and virtually his entire staff of 1,300 people had been put on paid leave.
Abramowitz said that the order left VOA unable to carry out its ""vital mission... especially critical today, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States"".
The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order ""undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press"".
It added: ""If an entire newsroom can be sidelined overnight, what does that say about the state of press freedom?
""An entire institution is being dismantled piece by piece. This isn't just a staffing decision - it's a fundamental shift that endangers the future of independent journalism at VOA.""
The president's order targets VOA's parent company US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also funds non-profit entities such as Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, which were originally set up to counter communism.
It tells managers to ""reduce performance… to the minimum presence and function required by law"".
CBS, the BBC's US news partner, said that VOA employees were notified in an email by Crystal Thomas, the USAGM human resources director.
A source told CBS that all freelance workers and international contractors were told there was now no money to pay them.
Emails obtained by CBS notified the bosses of Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that their federal grants had been terminated.
VOA and other stations under USAGM say they serve more than 400 million listeners. They are broadly equivalent to the BBC World Service, which is part-funded by the British government.
The Czech Republic's Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavský, said he hoped the European Union could help keep Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty running in Prague.
He said he would ask European foreign ministers at a meeting on Monday to find ways to at least partially maintain the broadcaster's operations.
Elon Musk, the billionaire and top adviser to Trump who has been overseeing sweeping cuts to the US government, has used his social media platform X to call for VOA to be shut down.
The US president also cut funding to several other federal agencies - including those responsible for preventing homelessness, and funding museums and libraries.
Trump was highly critical of VOA in his first term. He has recently appointed staunch loyalist Kari Lake to be a special adviser for the USAGM.
The president regularly states that mainstream media outlets are biased against him. He called CNN and MSNBC ""corrupt"" during a speech at the justice department.
Voice of America launched in 1942 with a mandate to combat Nazi and Japanese propaganda. Its first broadcast - made on a transmitter loaned to the US by the BBC - stated a modest purpose.
Gerald Ford, a former president, signed VOA's public charter in 1976 to safeguard its editorial independence.
By 1994, the Broadcast Board of Governors, with oversight over non-military broadcasting, was established.
In 2013, a shift in legislation allowed VOA and affiliates to begin broadcasting in the US.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e7011n03vo,They had a fairytale American childhood - but was radiation slowly killing them?,2025-03-16T16:08:42.212Z,"Sophie Williams
BBC News, Washington DC","After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital’s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.
""Doctors were shocked,"" she says. ""We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs.""
Kim’s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45.
Zack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.
Years later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.
In this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s.
A compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area.
This Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (£2bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.
Benefits were paid to such neighbours, frequently called ""downwinders"", in Arizona, Utah and Nevada, but not New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.
St Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area.
Decades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: ""The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure.""
The clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038.
A new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump.
When Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling.
""My husband didn’t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we’re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral',"" she says.
Just streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek.
""I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,"" says Karen. ""Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night.""
But years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.
""Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,"" she says. ""We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can’t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this.""
When Karen’s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen’s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.
Karen helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.
""We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,"" she says. ""These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases.""
Teresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.
Years later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up.
That does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected.
""ALS took my sister at 50,"" Teresa says. ""I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she’d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it.""
Like Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring.
Expanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer.
In a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste.
The BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment.
""My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She’d be the first to picket,"" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government.
The trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals.
Dr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a ""statistical thing"", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers.
Now, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek.
""I tell them that there’s a potential that there’s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier.""
He hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area.
Other experts take a different view of the risks. ""There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades"", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University.
""But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited.""
Prof Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts to eliminate any hazards.
For many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste.
""It’s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,” says Kim Visintine. “There’s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it’s just a matter of time.""

BBC News","At least 34 people have died in the US after violent tornadoes tore through several south-eastern states, flipping cars and flattening homes.
In Kansas, a dust storm on Friday afternoon caused a crash with more than 50 vehicles, killing at least eight people. Texas saw a similar mass pile-up.
A state of emergency has been declared in several states, including Arkansas, Georgia and Oklahoma, where more than 100 wildfires were raging.
A third day of severe weather was forecast for Sunday, with flash flooding and more tornado warnings issued across the region. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned of ""intense to violent"" tornadoes, describing the situation as ""particularly dangerous"".
""Get to the sturdiest structure you have access to and remain in place until the storms pass,"" the NWS told residents in Alabama on Saturday night, when multiple tornado warnings were issued.
At least 250,000 properties across the US were without power on Sunday morning, according to tracker PowerOutage.
In Missouri, where at least 12 people died, Governor Mike Kehoe said the state had been ""devastated by severe storms... leaving homes destroyed and lives lost"".
Initial reports showed 19 tornadoes had struck 25 counties in the state, its emergency management agency said.
A home belonging to one of those killed was torn apart.
""It was unrecognisable as a home. Just a debris field,"" Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.
""The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.""
Alicia Wilson, who was evacuated from her Missouri home, told local TV station KSDK: ""It was the scariest thing I've ever been through - it was so fast, our ears were all about to burst.""
A woman in Mississippi described how terrified her daughter was.
""All I could hear was my six year old screaming that she didn't want to die - you don't want to hear that coming out of your baby's mouth,"" Jericho McCoy said.
In Texas, a dust storm caused a pile-up of about 38 cars, which killed at least four people, local officials told AFP.
""It's the worst I've ever seen,"" Sgt Cindy Barkley, of the state's public safety department, told reporters.
""We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled.""
The destructive storms fuelled many wildfires in several central states, including Oklahoma, where more than 130 fires were reported on Friday, the state's department of emergency management said.
As of Saturday, it said there had been 112 fire-related injuries reported by hospitals in the state.
Governor Kevin Stitt, who visited his own ranch to find he had ""lost everything to the fires"", said the damage in the state was unbelievable.
""Oklahomans, we are in this together and we will build back stronger,"" he said.
Tornadoes form when moist, warm air rises, mixing with cold air above to generate thunderclouds. Winds blowing from different directions cause the air to rotate, creating a vortex of air that moves upwards.
Several states, including Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas, lie within so-called Tornado Alley - a path frequently hit by the weather phenomenon, as the geography is ideal for their formation.
Peak tornado season in the region is from May to June - but meteorologists caution that they can occur at any time of year.

BBC News, Los Angeles","The will of legendary actor Gene Hackman has been released, but uncertainty lingers over his $80m (£62m) fortune.
The two-time Academy Award winner left his entire estate to his wife of 30 years, Betsy Arakawa. But Arakawa, 65, was found dead alongside her husband in their New Mexico home last month.
Legal experts have now said that, because authorities say Arakawa died seven days before her husband, Hackman's children could now potentially inherit his fortune, despite not being named in the will.
His three children with his late ex-wife, Faye Maltese - Christopher, 65, Elizabeth, 62, and Leslie, 58 - have not commented publicly on the matter.
Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting
Legal documents obtained by the BBC show Hackman, 95, named Arakawa as his sole beneficiary in 1995, with the last update to the will in 2005.
However, California attorney Tre Lovell told the BBC that the estate could default to them under succession laws, as long as there was no other beneficiary named.
""The estate will actually be probated in accordance with intestate succession laws and the children would be lawfully next in line to inherit,"" he said.
They would also need to prove that the will is invalid because Arakawa died before Hackman, he added.
Authorities say Arakawa passed away on 11 February after contracting a rare virus, days before Hackman died of natural causes.
The couple was found dead in separate rooms of their $4m Santa Fe home on 26 February after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.
Arakawa was found in the bathroom with pills scattered nearby, while Hackman was in the back of the house, wearing sweatpants and slippers, his cane and sunglasses beside him.
Officials determined he died seven days after his wife due to severe heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's listed as a contributing factor.
Authorities initially deemed the scene ""suspicious"" but later ruled out foul play.
Arakawa's own will left her assets to Hackman, with a provision that if they died within 90 days of each other, her estate would go to a trust and later be donated to charity after covering medical expenses.
Hackman has in the past discussed his relationship with his children.
""You become very selfish as an actor,"" he told The New York Times in 1989. ""Even though I had a family, I took jobs that would separate us for three or four months at a time. The temptations in that, the money and recognition, it was too much for the poor boy in me.""
Hackman's children, though rarely in the public eye, occasionally attended red carpet events with him.
In another interview, Hackman talked about the difficulty his children had of growing up with a parent who was constantly in the spotlight.
""It's tough being the son or daughter of a celebrity,"" he told The Irish Independent in 2000. ""I couldn't always be home with them when they were growing up, and then, living in California, they've had my success always hanging over their heads.""
His daughters and granddaughter expressed deep affection for him after his passing.
""He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us, he was always just Dad and Grandpa,"" they said. ""We will miss him sorely, and are devastated by the loss.""",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03gjnxe25o,Arlington Cemetery strips content on black and female veterans from website,2025-03-15T17:22:02.918Z,"Brandon Drenon
BBC News, Washington DC","Arlington National Cemetery has scrubbed from its website information and educational materials about the history of black and female service members.
Some of the content removed from the site was on veterans who had received the nation's highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor, according to military news site Task & Purpose.
The content removal is part of a larger effort by President Donald Trump to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the military and throughout the federal government.
Approximately 400,000 veterans are buried in the Army-run cemetery, which was established after the US Civil War at the home of the South's general, Robert E. Lee.
On the cemetery's website, internal links that directed users to webpages with information about the ""Notable Graves"" of dozens of black, Hispanic and female veterans were missing on Friday.
The pages contained short biographies about veterans such as Gen Colin L Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the highest rank in the military after the president.
They also told the life stories of members of the Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military airmen.
Earlier this year, the Defense Department had to reinstate training materials on the revered airmen after a national outcry over their removal following Trump's orders on DEI.
Information on Hector Santa Anna, a World War II bomber pilot and career military leader who has been called a hero of the war, has been taken down, as well.
Visitors to the site may also have trouble finding information, as links to major sections have disappeared. It no longer lists pages for African American History, Hispanic American History and Women's History.
Content still exists on some notable women buried there, including former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 14 veterans from the unit recently featured in the Oscar-nominated movie The Six Triple Eight, but it is only found from a direct search.
Since re-entering the White House, President Donald Trump has signed multiple executive orders banning DEI within the federal government.
A spokesperson for the cemetery said in a statement it was working to restore links and content and remained ""committed to sharing the stories of military service and sacrifice to the nation"", according to the Washington Post.
It added that it wanted to ensure that the content aligned with Trump's orders and also with instructions from Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth.
Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, condemned the content removal.
""The whole thing is deeply concerning,"" Smith said in an interview with the New York Times.
""Even if you have concerns about the way DEI was handled in a number of different places, I've never seen a problem within the military.""
Trump has made dramatic changes in the military in his second term, including firing the country's top general, CQ Brown, a black man who had supported diversity in the armed forces.
Secretary Hegseth - a former Fox News host and military veteran - has pledged to root out all diversity initiatives and had accused Gen Brown of being ""woke"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70enzddxywo,'Do you have communist links?' US sends 36 questions to UN aid groups,2025-03-15T12:09:13.673Z,"Imogen Foulkes
BBC News, Geneva","United Nations aid agencies have been sent questionnaires by the US asking them to state if they have ""anti-American"" beliefs or affiliations.
Among the 36 questions on the form, sent by the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and seen by the BBC, is one asking if they have any links to communism.
Some of the world's biggest humanitarian organisations have received the questionnaire. This includes the UN's refugee agency, and - outside the UN - the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The Trump administration has launched a cost-cutting drive across the US government, led by billionaire Elon Musk, and has closed down much of its foreign aid.
The UN groups fear the move by the OMB is a sign the US is planning to abandon humanitarian work - or even the UN itself - altogether.
The US pulled out of the World Health Organization on the first day of US President Donald Trump's second term.
And this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the vast majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes had been terminated.
Surveys indicate that most Americans believe the country overspends on foreign aid.
The US spends a lower percentage of its GDP on aid than European countries but, because of its huge economy, still supplies 40% of global humanitarian funding
Many of the UN aid agencies who were sent the form receive funding, not just from USAID, but directly from the US government.
One question asks: ''Can you confirm that your organisation does not work with entities associated with communist, socialist, or totalitarian parties, or any party that espouses anti-American beliefs?""
Another asks agencies to confirm they don't receive any funding from China, Russia, Cuba or Iran - these countries may not be Washington's best friends but, like all 193 UN member states, they fund the big humanitarian agencies.
Other questions ask aid agencies to ensure no project includes any elements of DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) or anything related to climate change.
This could be awkward for agencies like Unicef, which supports equal access to education for girls, or the World Food Programme, which tries to prevent famine by supporting drought affected communities to transition to more climate resilient crops.
Professor Karl Blanchet, of Geneva University's Centre for Humanitarian Studies, believes the aid agencies are being set up to fail: ""The decision has already been made. It's highly likely the US is going to stop its involvement in any UN system.
""It's multilateralism versus America first - these are two ends of a spectrum.""
Aid agencies working on complex humanitarian operations are more blunt.
""It's like being asked 'have you stopped beating your child, yes or no?'"" said one frustrated aid worker.
The UN aid agencies believe the questionnaire misunderstands their core principles of neutrality and impartiality - that people suffering because of war or natural disaster should be helped regardless of political beliefs, and that aid should not be used as a tool to strengthen one particular nation.
UN Human Rights has already chosen not to fill out the form.
""Given they were mostly yes/no questions with very limited room for elaboration, and that some of the questions were not applicable to the UN, we were not in a position to reply directly to the online questionnaires,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.
""Instead, we provided replies by email with explanations to those questions where we could provide a response.""
Some of the questions also reflect the economic interests of President Trump's administration.
There is a query about projects which might affect ""efforts to strengthen US supply chains or secure rare earth minerals"".

BBC News","US immigration authorities have announced the arrest of a second activist who participated in pro-Palestinian protests last spring at Columbia University in New York City.
Leqaa Kordia, who is a Palestinian and from the West Bank, was arrested in New Jersey, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement on Friday.
The statement said another student, Ranjani Srinivasani, who has Indian citizenship, chose to ""self-deport"" by leaving the US earlier this week.
This follows the arrest of Columbia campus activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained on Saturday in New York before being flown to a jail in Louisiana.
The DHS statement says that Ms Kordia had overstayed her student visa, which had been terminated in 2022 ""for lack of attendance"". It did not say whether she had been attending Columbia or another institution.
She had previously been arrested in April 2024 for taking part in protests at Columbia University, according to DHS.
Ms Srinivasan, a doctoral student in Urban Planning at Columbia University, had her visa revoked on 5 March.
""It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement.
""When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.""
Ms Srinivasan's lawyer Ramzi Kassem told the Wall Street Journal that the government's statement was ""full of the falsehoods we've come to expect of DHS"".
Mr Kassem told the paper the government ""violated basic rights"" by revoking a visa ""simply for engaging in protected political speech"".
The BBC contacted a lawyer for Ms Srinivasan for comment on Friday evening.
Contact details for Mr Kodia's lawyer were not immediately available.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US.
The president argues these protesters should be deported.
Mr Khalil, 30, is a Syrian-born Columbia graduate and US green card holder.
His case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.
His lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel.
Mr Khalil's lawyers deny that he supports Hamas.
Additionally, on Thursday night DHS agents executed two search warrants in rooms on the Columbia campus.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche of the US justice department said the agents were searching for evidence that the university was ""harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus"".
""That investigation is ongoing, and we are also looking at whether Columbia's handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes,"" he said.
Columbia Interim President Katrina Armstrong said in a letter to the campus that she was ""heartbroken"" to inform them of the federal raid.
""No one was arrested or detained. No items were removed, and no further action was taken,"" she said.
The Trump administration has also pulled $400m (£310m) of federal funding from Columbia University, saying it failed to fight antisemitism on campus.",US & Canada

BBC News","The US has averted a government shutdown after the Senate passed a Republican-led measure to keep the government funded for the next six months.
The stopgap funding bill passed in the Senate 54-46, as two Democrats joined all but one Republican senator in voting yes. President Donald Trump had signed it into law, a White House spokesman said on Saturday.
The key vote came earlier when some Senate Democrats, after fierce debate, allowed the measure to pass a procedural hurdle.
The Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, and nine others broke with their colleagues to vote to advance the bill to its final Friday evening vote.
Two Democrats - Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Independent Senator Angus King of Maine - voted in favour of its final passage. Schumer voted ""no"".
On Thursday, he announced he would vote to allow the measure to move forward, saying although it wasn't a bill he liked, he believed triggering a shutdown would be a worse result.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez called Schumer's willingness to let the spending bill proceed a ""huge slap in the face"", adding that there is a ""wide sense of betrayal"" among the party, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.
She said supporting the bill ""codifies the chaos and the reckless cuts that Elon Musk has been pursuing"", and that Senate Democrats who voted yes would be empowering ""the robbing of our federal government in order to finance tax cuts for billionaires"".
The Democrats had agonised over whether to support the measure, and eventually pushed for a 30-day continuing resolution that was unlikely to earn enough support to pass.
Senator Ted Cruz accused the Democrats of conducting ""political theater"" and praised the bill's passage.
""The government is funded, let's get back to work,"" he said in a statement.
The passage is a victory for Trump and congressional Republicans.
On Friday morning, Trump offered rare bipartisan praise of Schumer's decision to let the bill advance, writing that ""a non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights"".
The legislation would keep much of the federal funding levels from the Biden Administration in place, with some key changes.
It increases military spending by $6bn (£4.6bn), for items like border security, veterans healthcare, and military spending. But would cut non-defence funding by about $13bn.
Local officials in Washington DC had feared the bill would result in a $1bn cut in federal funds for the city over the next six months. However, the Senate approved a separate bill that kept its current operating budget intact, the New York Times reported.",US & Canada

BBC News, New York","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs has pleaded not guilty to an amended indictment that includes new allegations of forced labour.
The superseding indictment alleges the rap mogul forced employees to work long hours under threat of physical and reputational harm and forced at least one worker to engage in sex acts with him.
Mr Combs's lawyers have denied that the rap mogul has ever forced anyone into sex acts and that the case revolves around consensual relationships with his girlfriends, the New York Times reports.
His lawyers have also ""vehemently"" denied all the accusations made against him in the federal case and dozens of civil lawsuits that have been filed against him in recent months.
""He looks forward to his day in court when it will become clear that he has never forced anyone to engage in sexual acts against their will,"" his lawyer Marc Agnifilo has said.
Mr Combs, one of the most successful rappers in the US, is soon expected to stand trial in a federal sex trafficking and racketeering case.
The new allegations detailed in the amended indictment come under the racketeering charge.
Separately, Mr Combs faces dozens of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault. His lawyers have dismissed the lawsuits as ""clear attempts to garner publicity.""
Mr Combs was led into a wood-panelled courtroom on Friday in New York's southern district federal court wearing a greenish-tan prison jumpsuit, with overgrown grey hair and a beard.
He chose to stand as he entered his not guilty plea. Asked by a judge if he had seen and read the indictment, he responded, ""Yes, I have sir"".
Behind him, in the public benches, his son Christian, his daughter Chance, his mother Janice Combs - wearing large sunglasses, and friend Marvet Britto (a publicist) came to support him, along with two other men who described themselves as part of the family's ""support system"".
Mr Combs was smiling in court, waving and blowing kisses to his family and hugging his lawyers.
As well as the new allegations, there was also much discussion in court between the prosecution and defence's lawyers over a video published by CNN last year appearing to show CCTV footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend, Cassandra Ventura, on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.
Mr Combs's lawyers repeated their claims that the video was ""deceptive"" and that a visual expert had found that parts of the video were taken out of order, the actions sped up, and timestamps covered up.
Prosecutors on the other hand described it as ""critical"" and ""direct evidence"" of their case that they will submit as an exhibit in the trial. The judge urged them to reach a compromise.
CNN and a lawyer for Ms Ventura have denied what Mr Combs' lawyers said about the video.
After the video was released in 2024, Mr Combs apologised for his behaviour, saying: ""I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.""
On Friday, the judge said jury selection was expected to start on 5 May, and opening statements on 12 May.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr723zn40e5o,Democratic Party infighting exposes struggle to unite against Trump,2025-03-14T22:40:58.346Z,"Anthony Zurcher
North America correspondent in Washington•@awzurcher","On Friday, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, found himself in a particularly uncomfortable position.
President Donald Trump was singing his praises. And former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other influential Democrats were expressing their dismay with him – or worse.
This was Schumer's fate the day after he decided to back a Republican-crafted measure to avert a possible US government shutdown this weekend.
Later, he followed through on his promise, voting with nine other Democrats and all but one Republican to overcome the key procedural hurdle that - if Democrats had stuck together in opposition - would have prevented the funding bill from coming to a final vote.
The Senate bill, which passed that final vote shortly after, contained a number of provisions that angered liberals. These included cuts to non-military programmes, increased spending on border security, limits on how Congress can rescind Trump's tariffs and draconian restrictions on Washington DC's budget.
Schumer acknowledged all of this, but said he was backing the bill because a shutdown, which would allow the president to determine what government services and employees to suspend, would be worse.
""I believe it is the best way to minimise the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,"" he said on Friday. ""Allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via government shutdown is a far worse option.""
It didn't take long after Schumer's announcement for Democratic second guessing – and straight-up outrage – to ensue.
""Chuck Schumer is unwilling and unable to meet the moment,"" the Democratic group Pass the Torch, which led calls for Joe Biden to end his re-election bid last summer, said in a statement.
Pelosi, who wields considerable influence among House Democrats despite having stepped down from her leadership position, decried what she said was a ""false choice"" between a shutdown and accepting the Republican measure.
""We must fight back in a better way,"" she said, suggesting a short-term funding extension and new bipartisan negotiations. She called the Republican bill a ""blank cheque that makes a devastating assault on the well-being of working families across America"".
In a Friday press conference, the current House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, dodged questions about Schumer. When asked if he still had confidence in his Senate counterpart, he tersely replied: ""Next question.""
Others in the party were less circumspect. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia told reporters that he expected ""new leadership"" in the Senate next year – or after the next presidential election in 2028.
A group of 60 House Democrats – who joined all but one in their party to vote against the Republican bill in that chamber – penned a letter to Schumer, saying that the legislation ""potentially legitimises President Trump and the Republican party's dismantling of government"".
""If Republicans in Congress want to pass this bill,"" they wrote, ""they should do so with their own votes.""
As if to add rub salt on Democratic wounds, Trump took to his Truth Social website on Friday morning to praise what he said was a ""good and smart move"" by Schumer – and to promise that more Republican legislation on taxes, spending and ""so much more"" was coming.
""This could lead to something big for USA,"" he wrote, ""a whole new direction and beginning!""
While many rank-and-file Democrats and liberal activists clamoured for Schumer and Senate Democrats to block the House measure even if it triggered a government shutdown, it is unclear whether such a move would have pressured Trump and Republicans to negotiate a less partisan government-funding bill.
In fact, there are many on the right, including Trump's designated government slasher, Elon Musk, who were relishing an opportunity to use a shutdown to further hamstring the federal bureaucracy.
After days, or weeks, of shutdown pain that would disproportionately affect their supporters, the Democratic Party could have found itself in the same place it is now – with limited power and few good options.
""Neither House Democrats nor the people voting 'no' in the Senate nor the people getting mad on Twitter have an actual strategy for getting what the base wants out of this, which is some kind of act of Congress saying that Trump and Musk need to conduct the government differently,"" writes Matthew Yglesias, a left-leaning commentator.
Democrats have the power to block Republican legislation, but they simply don't have the votes to advance their own alternative either in the House or the Senate.
That doesn't make the situation Schumer and the Democrats have found themselves in any easier to stomach, however. Republicans, by sticking together, have been able to exert their will in Congress, while Trump pushes the boundaries of presidential power.

BBC News, Washington","The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has permanently restricted non-essential helicopter operations around Reagan National Airport following a deadly mid-air collision with an American Airlines regional jet in January.
The change is an attempt to improve safety around the airport, which is just outside of the nation's capital in Washington DC.
In January, a US Army Black Hawk helicopter with a crew of three collided with an American Airlines jet carrying 64 people. Both aircraft crashed near the airport. All 67 aboard were killed.
The FAA's announcement followed the release of a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigating the crash.
The FAA also announced on Friday it will eliminate helicopter and fixed-wing mixed traffic by the airport.
It said it was evaluating other routes for helicopters, which are commonly used in Washington.
The new restrictions will allow helicopters to only fly through the airport's airspace on urgent matters - such as for life-saving medical reasons, priority law enforcement or presidential transport - but it aims to keep them a distance away from airplanes, according to the agency.
Additionally, runways 15 and 33, near where the doomed American Airlines flight was seconds away from landing, will also be blocked for aircraft when helicopters are in the area.
US air crash investigators earlier this week recommended restricting helicopter flights in certain areas near the airport.
The FAA is also assessing other cities with chartered helicopter routes, including Boston, New York, Detroit, Dallas, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles.

BBC News, Washington and Toronto","Mark Carney, an economist and political newcomer, has been sworn in as Canada's new prime minister, and delivered remarks vowing to ""never"" become a part of the United States.
He took office on Friday just days after being elected leader of the governing Liberal Party and amid an ongoing trade war with US President Donald Trump.
""We know that by building together, we can give ourselves far more than anyone else can take away,"" he said after the ceremony.
Carney replaces outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in office for nine years, after a landslide victory in last week's Liberal leadership race.
""We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the US,"" Carney told reporters in Ottawa on Friday, referring to Trump's musings that Canada join the US as its ""51st state"".
""We are very fundamentally a different country,"" he said, later adding the notion is ""crazy"".
He declined to answer questions about the timing of Canada's next federal election - currently scheduled for October - but hinted he would move quickly to seek ""as strong a mandate that is needed for the time"".
In his first order as prime minister, Carney moved to end a policy that had been frequent attacked against by political opponents.
He ended the consumer carbon pricing programme - a key environmental policy under Trudeau that had become deeply unpopular in recent years amid high inflation.
Conservatives have criticised the tax, saying it raised the price of goods and energy for Canadian families.
At an afternoon cabinet meeting, Carney said his government will still take steps to fight climate change. An industrial carbon tax on large emitters remains in place.
Canadians receive a rebate to offset the cost of carbon pricing and will get their final cheque in April.
Canadian politics in recent months have largely been overshadowed by the trade war Trump launched after taking office in January - and with a general election on the horizon, Carney is expected to pitch himself as the candidate best equipped to take on Trump.
He previously held roles as governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, and of the Bank of England, and helped both countries weather major financial disruption.
He intends to travel to the UK and France as his first foreign trip as PM next week.
Carney said he also looks forward to speaking with Trump.
""We respect the United States. We respect President Trump,"" he said.
""President Trump is has put some very important issues at the top of his agenda.""
Carney has promised to uphold Canada's reciprocal tariffs on specific American goods for as long as Trump maintains 25% universal tariffs on Canadian goods not covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) trade deal.
Canada is dependent on trade with the US. Economists say it risks a recession if Trump's tariffs are fully imposed.
Several of Carney's new cabinet members served under Trudeau, and in particular he kept on those who have been working directly with the Trump administration in recent months.
They including Mélanie Joly, who remains in foreign affairs; David McGuinty, who remains in public safety; Jonathan Wilkinson, staying on as energy minister; Dominic Leblanc, who has moved from finance to trade; and François-Philippe Champagne, moved from industry to finance.
When the federal election comes, Carney's main rival will be Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.
Before the the threat of tariffs, Conservatives enjoyed a 20-point lead in some election polls. Now polls are indicating a much closer race.
Speaking after Carney on Friday, Poilievre argued that Liberals do not deserve a fourth term in office, arguing adding they have already had nine years to improve affordability and other issues in the country.
""It will be the same Liberal results,"" he said.
Poilievre added that if he were to be elected prime minister, he would ""face off against President Trump directly, respond with counter tariffs and take back control"".
When Canadians next go to the polls, the Liberals will face not only the Conservatives - who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons - but also the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats, and the New Democrats (NDP), who have 24.
Reacting to Carney's swearing in, the leader of the NDP argued that his cabinet appointments show that there is no room for progressive Liberals under his leadership.
Jagmeet Singh said that he had failed to create separate cabinet portfolios for minister of women, youth, or people with disabilities, and described Carney as someone who has made billionaires ""very rich at the cost of workers"".",US & Canada

BBC News","""Nerve-wrecking, terrifying and horrific.""
That is how one witness described her experience getting off an American Airlines flight that caught fire after it was forced to make an emergency landing in Colorado.
Some of the 172 passengers travelling on the flight bound for Dallas were seen standing on the plane's wing after it touched down in Denver, with large plumes of smoke encircling around them.
Everyone on board, including six crew members, made it out of the plane alive, with 12 passengers treated at hospital for minor injuries, according to airport officials.
One of those passengers, Michele Woods, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, how everything about the flight seemed normal at take off.
It was not until they were cruising in the air that she noticed a loud noise reverberating from one of the plane's engines.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later confirmed the plane diverted to Denver at around 17:15 local time (23:15 GMT) after the crew reported ""engine vibrations"".
But even when the plane landed, passengers soon realised they were still far from safety.
""Everything was fine but then there was smoke filling the cabin,"" said Ms Woods, who was returning home after attending a trade show in Colorado.
Seated at the front of the plane, she explained how she was one of the few in a position where they were able to walk off the plane once it had touched down.
Other passengers, as now viral images of huddled people standing on the wing of a smoking plane show, did not have as straightforward an escape.
Ingrid Hibbit, who was travelling on flight 1006 with her husband and daughter, was one of the unfortunate few forced out onto the wing before she could reconnect with her family on the ground.
""[You could see] flames from the window and the windows [were] kind of melting,"" Ms Hibbit told CBS. Dismounting from the plane proved to be a difficult task - not helped, she pointed out, by being dressed in Birkenstock sandals.
""I was like shaking, I was not stable,"" she admitted.
Adding to her already fever-pitch anxieties was the fact neither she, nor any member of her family, were seated in the same section of the plane. They could communicate only through text messages.
""I was hoping everything was okay, but we really didn't know for sure,"" she said, adding that despite the ordeal lasting only 10 minutes, ""it was a very long 10 minutes"".
""It was a really great feeling to see that everyone was okay.""
She and her family finally touched down at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on Friday morning, along with several of the other passengers.
Relief, she said, had swept through the group, particularly after an ""exhausting"" episode that had overshadowed the start of their family holiday.
""If this would've happened in the air, I don't think we would be telling this story at all, because who knows what that would've been like,"" she said. ""I'm grateful that everyone survived.""",US & Canada

BBC News","The eighth week of Donald Trump's second term has been marked by the dizzying ping-pong of tariffs and counter-tariffs, and Ukraine peace talks with officials from both Kyiv and Moscow.
The US president and his administration continue to make headlines as they forge ahead with their policies. Here's a quick look at some of their biggest recent moves.
Trump went ahead with his plan for a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium products coming from the rest of the world.
But his team halted its plan to double US tariffs on imports of Canadian steel and aluminium to 50%, only hours after threatening America's northern neighbour in another skirmish in their trade war.
The rollback came after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his province would suspend new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends across the border.
""Cooler heads prevailed,"" Peter Navarro, a trade adviser in the White House, told broadcaster CNBC.
Tariffs and the unpredictable threats of new ones raised concerns among investors, particularly in light of a question Trump appeared to dodge over the weekend about whether the US economy was headed for a downward turn.
In an interview on Fox News, the president who presides over the world's largest economy refused to be drawn on a question about whether there was a recession on the horizon - saying instead that the US was in a ""period of transition"" because ""what we're doing is very big"".
Those words seemed to do little to reassure confidence among investors, as the US S&P 500 share index fell nearly 3% the next day.
US allies across the Atlantic also weren't spared by Trump's tariff threats, as he took to his Truth Social network on Thursday to threaten European Union countries with a 200% tariff on alcohol.
His alcohol tariffs are the latest escalation in a separate trade war with EU nations, who earlier that day unveiled their own counter-tariffs to Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs.
Trump - who has eschewed alcohol his whole life - highlighted in his social media post that the whopping 200% tariff would only cease once the EU stops a ""nasty 50% tariff on whisky"". He called the union ""hostile and abusive"".
Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ""temperature was brought down"" this week between the US and Canada thanks largely to an olive branch that was extended by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
The two nations struck a more diplomatic tone by the end of the week - which begun with a frenzy of tariffs and counter-tariffs.
Ford, who just last week threatened to turn off the power that Canada provides to the US, emerged from an hours-long sit-down in Washington DC with Lutnick, saying: ""I can honestly say that was the best meeting I've ever had coming down here.""
A proposal for a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine was unveiled this week in Saudi Arabia. It was the most recent step in the Trump administration's plans to secure peace in the region after more than three years of full-scale war.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz met a Ukrainian team for several hours on Tuesday. Afterwards, Kyiv said it was ready to support the immediate pause in fighting.
A separate team of US officials, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow on Thursday to discuss the terms with Russian officials. He was met by President Vladimir Putin, who said afterwards there was still ""a lot ahead to be done"" on a ceasefire deal.
Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia did prompt some action. The US delegation said afterwards it would resume sending military aid to Ukraine and sharing intelligence with the embattled country - with whom its relations have recently soured.
The announcement came just days after the Pentagon announced that it would suspend sharing satellite imagery with Ukraine - technology that Kyiv relies on for tracking the movements of Russian troops and missile attacks.
As part of its drive to cut government cuts, the administration scrapped funding for $20bn (£15.4bn) worth of Biden-era climate and environmental grants on Tuesday. The projects had been frozen for weeks.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also announced plans to end the funding for more than 400 diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice grants with about $1.7bn.
A federal judge pressed the government's lawyers on Wednesday to present ""some kind of evidence"" that these grants were ""unlawfully done"".
The administration tried to deport a permanent legal US resident and Columbia University graduate for his participation in 2024 protests at the campus over the war in Gaza. The attempt is now the subject of a legal battle.
Palestinian protester Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder who was considered one of the faces of the movement at Columbia, has been held at a detention centre in Louisiana where he was sent after his arrest in New York.
Khalil's arrest, Trump has said, was one of ""many to come"" and arrived not long after his administration announced that it was cutting off $400m (£309m) worth of grants to Columbia University because it had failed to fight antisemitism on campus. The university has pledged to get its funding restored.
The Department of Education announced this week that it planned to lay off 1,300 workers, a move that will effectively slash the department's workforce in half.
Tasked with managing federal loans for college and enforcing civil rights law in school, the department has long been eyed by Trump and some conservatives to be eliminated altogether - although such an action would require Congress approval.
Staff at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were told to ""shred as many documents"" and personnel files as they could this week, as the weeks-long purge on the agency has left the vast majority of its initiatives hollowed out.
After exhausting that option, staff were instructed, they should then turn to ""burn bags"".
The request, which raised alarm among employees and labour groups, comes as Secretary of State Rubio confirmed that 83% of the long-running aid programmes managed under USAID have now been terminated.
Trump engaged in a different kind of diplomacy when he penned his thoughts on a piece of paper rather than tagging a foreign leader in a social media post.
In a letter addressed to Iran's supreme leader, passed through an official from the UAE, the US president said he'd set out plans for negotiations over Tehran's nuclear programme.
His warnings of facing potential military action unless talks were agreed to seem to have fallen on uninterested ears - as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the idea of negotiations, calling it ""deception of public opinion"".
Dave Weldon, the Republican tipped to head the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), was withdrawn by the Trump administration to be its candidate for the public health agency - the decision coming only hours before he was set to testify before a Senate committee.
The 71-year-old doctor and former Florida congressman was said by the White House to ""not have the votes in the Senate"" to be confirmed, an official told CBS News, BBC's news partner.
Up until now, all of Trump's picks - including some of his more controversial ones - have been approved.
Tesla facilities across the US were faced with protesters who stood outside the electric car manufacturers doors to call out its founder - Elon Musk - for the new role he plays in Donald Trump's administration.
The ""Tesla takedown"" protests have been largely peaceful, but a few in parts of the country have ended with fires being lit in showrooms.
This prompted Musk's new boss to proclaim that these individuals should be labelled domestic terrorists, as he held an event on the White House lawn showcasing the tech billionaire's product.
While the pair sat in the front seat of one of the electric cars, Trump told the media he planned to buy it.
During his Oval Office visit this week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin presented Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks.
JD Vance, who attended the same meeting, didn't miss his own chance to pay homage to the Irish prime minister, donning a pair of cream-coloured socks that were - fittingly - adorned with green shamrocks.
The gift of the traditional shamrock bowl was given a warm reception by the president, while the vice-president's attempts at celebrating the heritage of the Emerald Isle was less so.
""What's with these socks?"" the president asked, as the room erupted in laughter. The group were discussing inflation, but the socks proved to be a central talking point, too. ""I'm trying to stay focused, but I'm very impressed with the VP's socks.""",US & Canada

BBC News","The US may avert a looming government shutdown after a top Democrat said he would support a Republican funding bill to keep it open.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced his reversal on Thursday, after vowing he and other Democrats would block the bill, which would fund the government through September.
Other Democrats might now join him in voting to approve the measure - but splits could emerge, since some of his colleagues are still opposed.
Democrats face two options: help Republicans pass the bill, or stand their ground and oppose it. If they oppose, they will likely take the brunt of the blame for the shutdown, which would start at 23:59 EDT on Friday (03:59 GMT on Saturday).
""There are no winners in a government shutdown,"" Schumer said in his announcement on the Senate floor.
""It's not really a decision, it's a Hobson's choice: Either proceed with the bill before us or risk Donald Trump throwing America into the chaos of a shutdown.
""This in my view is no choice at all.""
He called the Republican-led funding bill deeply partisan but voiced concerns about a shutdown.
He said it would give Trump and Elon Musk, who have been leading an effort to slash federal spending, a ""carte blanche to destroy vital government services at a significantly faster rate than they can right now"".
Schumer's position was attacked by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman from the party's progressive wing, who told CNN was a ""deep sense of outrage and betrayal"" within their party.
Democrats in the Senate who have opposed the funding bill include Elizabeth Warren, who warned against giving Trump and Musk ""a blank cheque to spend your taxpayer money however they want"".
Elissa Slotkin, a senator who earlier this month gave her party's response to a major address by Trump, said she would continue to vote against the bill. Slotkin said she feared cuts to infrastructure projects in Michigan, which she represents.
Votes on the measure are expected on Friday afternoon.
Although Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, they have a procedural ace in the hole. Senate rules require 60 votes out its 100-member chamber to pass most legislation.
So while the 47 Democrats and left-leaning independents don't have the numbers to approve their own funding bill, they can block the Republican measure if they mostly stick together.
That's exactly the course many liberals, desperate for Democrats to take a more forceful stand against the Trump administration, have insisted the party pursue.
The political brinksmanship has its risks.
Some conservatives would relish a government shutdown that suspends programmes and services they see as wasteful or counterproductive. Musk himself has said that such a scenario would help his team better identify ""non-essential"" government functions that they could then permanently end as part of his Department of Government Efficiency.
Republicans would also be quick to blame any shutdown, and the disruptions it causes, on the Democrats. And an extended shutdown would directly affect the very workers and programmes that Democrats are trying to protect.
On Wednesday, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the bill that keeps the lights on through September – with strings attached.
The new resolution boosts military spending by $6bn (£4.6bn) over current levels, while slashing $13bn from non-defence programmes and allowing more money for border enforcement.
It also contains a provision that makes it harder for Democrats to force a vote on rescinding Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
Many Democrats have said they would not support the House resolution and demanded the ability to modify it.",US & Canada

Tech correspondent, San Francisco","Two US judges have ordered several federal government agencies to reinstate the jobs of probationary employees fired en masse by the Trump administration last month.
In California, District Judge William Alsup called the sacking of these employees part of a ""sham"" strategy that aimed to circumvent proper procedures for reducing the federal workforce.
His order - which was followed by another from Maryland - applies to thousands of probationary workers who were fired at a range of departments, including defence, energy, treasury, and veterans affairs.
The Department of Justice says the firings were done based on guidance - rather than a directive - from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
The BBC has contacted OPM for comment.
OPM, a once-obscure agency that manages the federal government's civil service, has been thrust into the spotlight amid President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the federal workforce.
In Thursday's hearing in San Francisco, California, Judge Alsup countered the DOJ lawyer's arguments from the bench, citing evidence including termination letters that stated the firings were carried out on OPM's instructions.
""That should not have been done in our country,"" Judge Alsup said. ""It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.""
Danielle Leonard, a lawyer representing a coalition of government employee unions, said probationary employees were targeted because they lacked the right to appeal.
During the hearing, Judge Alsup also lamented the firing of a government worker in Albuquerque, New Mexico who had been given top marks for performance but was then issued a pink slip citing performance as the cause of their termination.
""I just want to say it is a sad day when our government would fire a good employee and say it's for performance when they know good and well that's a lie,"" Judge Alsup said.
Judge Alsup's order was followed by a similar ruling from Baltimore, Maryland, by District Judge James Bredar, who agreed that Trump's team had broken regulations and cast doubt on the idea that the workers had been individually sacked for unsatisfactory performances.
Responding to the first ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Judge Alsup of singlehandedly ""attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch"".
She said that power rested with the president and ""singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president's agenda"".
""The Trump administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,"" she added.
Elon Musk's name was not mentioned during the California hearing, but he has been tasked by President Trump with downsizing the federal workforce through the ad hoc Department of Government Efficiency - or Doge.
""He was on everybody's mind,"" said Luz Fuller, president of a local Sacramento branch of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 4,500 employees in Northern California.
The White House has denied that Musk is the agency's leader, although Trump labelled him as such during his Congressional address last week.",US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vdnlmgyndo,Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?,2025-03-14T11:16:58.077Z,,"In one of his first acts as the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending automatic citizenship rights for nearly anyone born on US territory - known as ""birthright citizenship"".
It's a policy change he's long promised - but implementing it won't be easy. It has faced legal challenges and has been taken by Trump to the US Supreme Court.
Trump's order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or on temporary visas.
But it already has been blocked by courts in the early stages of what promises to be a long battle.
Most legal scholars say the president doesn't have the power to unilaterally change the law in this area, which is based on an amendment in the US Constitution.
The first sentence of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution establishes the principle of birthright citizenship:
""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.""
Immigration hardliners argue that the policy is a ""great magnet for illegal immigration"" and that it encourages pregnant women to cross the border in order to give birth and remain in the US, an act that has been pejoratively called ""birth tourism"" or having an ""anchor baby"".
Supporters of birthright citizenship point out that it has been the law of the land for well over a century and that eliminating it would create a ""permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans.""
The concept of birthright citizenship, also known by the legal term ""jus soli"", is based in English common law and was generally accepted to apply to white men throughout early American history.
However, it did not become part of the Constitution until 1868, when the 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.
Previous Supreme Court cases, like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, had determined that African Americans could never be US citizens. The 14th Amendment overrode that.
In 1898, the US Supreme Court ruled that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of US v Wong Kim Ark.
Wong was a 24-year-old child of legal Chinese immigrants who was born in the US, but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US, his parents' immigration status did not affect the application of the 14th Amendment.
The court ruled in Wong's favour and outlined a few limited exceptions to birthright citizenship, such as for children of diplomats.
""Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one's parents, all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered,"" writes Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. ""The court has not re-examined this issue since then.""
Most legal scholars say President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.
""He's doing something that's going to upset a lot of people, but ultimately this will be decided by the courts,"" said Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. ""This is not something he can decide on his own.""
Mr Prakash said that while the president can order employees of federal agencies to interpret citizenship more narrowly - agents with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example - that would trigger legal challenges from anyone whose citizenship is denied.
The Trump administration's arguments rest on the clause in the 14th Amendment that reads ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"". It argues that the language excludes children of non-citizens who are in the US unlawfully.
Courts have generally disagreed. In Plyler v Doe, a 1982 Supreme Court case involving a different part of the 14th Amendment, justices rejected an argument made by the state of Texas that undocumented immigrants were not ""persons within its jurisdiction"". The court ruled that migrants are both subject to US laws and granted the protections afforded by them.
A constitutional amendment could do away with birthright citizenship, but that would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and approval by three quarters of US states - a virtual impossibility on such a controversial proposal, given the current finely balanced divide in American politics.
According to Pew Research, about 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the United States in 2016, which is a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007. By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.
But as those children also have children, the cumulative effect of ending birthright citizenship could potentially increase the number of unauthorised immigrants in the country to 4.7m in 2050, the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, found.
In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said he thought the children of unauthorised immigrants should be deported alongside their parents - even if they were born in the US.
""I don't want to be breaking up families,"" Trump said last December. ""So the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.""
Trump has now taken the case to the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, after lower courts ruled against his plans.
Judges in district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state have blocked nationwide enforcement of Trump's order.
John Coughenour, a judge in Seattle, called it ""blatantly unconstitutional"".
Trump has tried to appeal the rulings. While he waits for the Supreme Court, birthright citizenship remains the law of the land.
More than 30 countries practise automatic ""jus soli"", or ""right of the soil"" without restriction in almost all cases.
Other countries, like the UK and Australia, allow for a modified version where citizenship is automatically granted if one parent is a citizen or permanent resident.",US & Canada

BBC News","Passengers on an American Airlines flight were evacuated on to the tarmac of an airport in Colorado as a fire broke out on the plane, sending smoke billowing into the air.
Footage of the evacuation showed passengers huddled on the wing of the Boeing airliner, some holding bags, with flames burning near the bottom of the plane.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said passengers used inflatable slides to reach the ground safely at the Denver International Airport. The agency said that it would investigate the cause of the incident.
There were no reports of serious injuries, although the airport later confirmed 12 people were taken to hospital for minor injuries.
The flight took off from nearby Colorado Springs and was on the way to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, the FAA said in a statement to the BBC.
The plane diverted to Denver around 17:15 local time (23:15 GMT) after the crew reported ""engine vibrations"", the FAA said.
After the plane landed, it caught fire while taxiing on the tarmac at the airport.
American Airlines said the plane had 172 passengers on board, along with six crew members. All were evacuated safely, the company said.
It added that the plane was a Boeing 737-800 and experienced an ""engine-related issue"".
Smoke and flames were visible from various gates at the airport, according to airport spokesman Michael Konopasek. He said the fire was doused and it did not lead to delays for other flights.
Some of those inside the airport posted videos on social media showing the plane's passengers walking toward the edge of the wing as large clouds of black smoke filled the air.
Ground crew can be seen rushing to the wing while pushing ladders.
Videos show flames under the plane's right engine as an inflatable evacuation slide appears at the aircraft's rear door.
The evacuation comes after a recent string of high-profile incidents in North America that have raised concerns about aviation safety.
A fatal crash in Washington DC left 67 people dead when an American Airlines regional jet collided mid-air with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter. The crash in the US capital city led to questions about air traffic controller shortages and their workloads.
US President Donald Trump's administration has also terminated hundreds of FAA probationary workers as part of government cost-saving efforts.
The layoffs happened weeks after the fatal DC crash.
The laid-off FAA employees included maintenance mechanics, environmental compliance workers and technical assistants.
Trump has pushed to reduce government spending with tech billionaire Elon Musk spearheading efforts as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).

BBC News, Washington DC","Columbia University has taken action against students who participated in a pro-Palestinian protest last spring and took over a campus building.
The school suspended and expelled some students who participated in occupying Hamilton Hall in a move that escalated last year's campus protests.
The Trump administration has pulled $400m (£310m) of federal funding from Columbia University, saying it failed to fight antisemitism on campus.
The university's actions also follow the arrest of Columbia campus activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained by federal immigration authorities on Saturday.
The university's Judicial Board (UJB) issued sanctions to students that ranged from ""multi-year suspensions, temporary degree revocation and expulsions"", the school said in a statement on Thursday.
A campus-wide email sent indicated the university issued these sanctions against dozens of students, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported.
""The return of suspended students will be overseen by Columbia's University Life Office,"" the school said in a statement. ""Columbia is committed to enforcing the University's Rules and Policies and improving our disciplinary processes.""
A group of students took over Hamilton Hall last April in an escalation of a tent encampment on campus that formed in protest over the war in Gaza.
Students barricaded themselves in the building.
Police later arrested dozens at the request of Columbia University officials. No one faced criminal charges.
The announcement comes as Mr Khalil, a Syrian-born Columbia graduate, remains in detention in Louisiana following a court hearing on Wednesday.
Mr Khalil's case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported.

BBC News, Toronto","As leaders around the world try to figure out how best to deal with the new Trump administration, one Canadian official has come out swinging.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a regular on major US networks where he has addressed Americans directly, was among the first in Canada to pull US alcohol off the shelves as a trade war between the two neighbours ramped up.
Ford has also ripped up a multi-million dollar contract with Elon Musk's Starlink, and has been unafraid to use energy exports to the US as a bargaining chip - all in a bid to get Trump to withdraw his tariff threats against Canada.
The right-wing, plain-spoken politician admitted he was initially delighted Donald Trump won re-election and viewed him as an ally.
But then, Ford said, using an expletive, the US president pulled a knife and ""yanked it into us"".
This week, it appeared that Ford's unusual tactics had grabbed Trump's attention.
Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Tuesday, the US president described Ford as a ""very strong man"" as he addressed Ontario's threat to slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity.
Ford has since shelved that plan pending further discussions with the Trump administration. But his threat to hike the price of electricity on Americans seems to have earned him a grudging nod of respect from Trump, who later backed off from doubling tariffs on aluminium and steel to 50%.
It also helped Ford score a meeting with US officials in Washington to discuss the future of the Canada-US trade relationship.
Ford sat on Thursday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The meeting was also attended by Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc.
The meeting was ""very, very productive"" though ""bumps in the road"" remain, he said afterwards.
It is unclear whether Ford's defiant stance will earn Canada more favours from Trump. It is also an approach that is not unanimously agreed on, with Premier Danielle Smith of the oil-rich Alberta vehemently refusing to withhold any of her province's energy exports to the US.
Trump's recent willingness to turn down the heat, however, signals that Ford may be succeeding in grabbing the attention of the US, said Shakir Chambers, a Canadian Conservative strategist at the Toronto-based Oyster Group.
""That's how you deal with Trump, through a position of strength,"" Mr Chambers told the BBC. ""Ford understands the language of Trump's people and inner circle.""
It at least earned him a rare compliment from the US president, who for several months has berated Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeatedly by calling him ""governor,"" while expressing his desire to absorb Canada and make it ""the 51st state"".
Also rare is seeing the Oval Office pay attention to the premier of a Canadian province, whose day-to-day is ordinarily preoccupied with domestic matters such as infrastructure projects, healthcare funding and co-operating with the federal government.
But these are no ordinary times in Canada. The country is in the middle of a transfer of power, from outgoing Trudeau to Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney.
It is also facing what has been referred to as an ""existential threat"" from its neighbour and long-time ally to the south.
Announcing his intention to pause energy tariffs pending trade talks, Ford vowed to Canadians that he will not ""roll over"" and warned that using Ontario's energy supply as a bargaining chip remains on the table.
But he said he will not ignore the chance to resolve this dispute with Americans.
His emergence as the face of Canada's fight is, in many ways, understandable. As Ontario premier, he is at the helm of a province that is home to 16 million people and Canada's large auto manufacturing sector, which is deeply intertwined with that of the US, leaving it vulnerable to any broad tariff threats.
He is also chair of the Council of the Federation, a multilateral congress that includes all of Canada's provincial and territorial premiers.
On Wednesday, Ford kept busy ahead of his meeting with the Americans. He sat down for breakfast with incoming Prime Minister Carney, where the two discussed the need to ""stand firm and strong"" to Trump.
Americans will undoubtedly see more of Ford in the coming weeks and months. The premier just decisively secured four more years in office after campaigning on standing up against the US president.
For Ontarians, Ford is a well-known figure. He has led the province since 2018 and is only the second premier in its history to secure three consecutive majority government wins.
He is the product of a Toronto political dynasty known as ""Ford Nation"". For many years, he was overshadowed by his younger brother, the late Rob Ford, who was the mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014 before he was ousted after a crack cocaine scandal.
Locally, the Fords are infamous for their ""authentic"" and approachable style of politics, said Mr Chambers, who was coached high school football by the younger Ford.
Premier Ford is known for handing out his personal cell phone number to constituents, encouraging them to contact him directly. During a news conference on US tariffs last week, he urged people to be patient as he worked to respond to more than 4,000 text messages he has received lately.
Despite his popularity, the premier is also embroiled in several controversies. Chief among them is an ongoing police investigation into a now-scrapped deal his government made that would have allowed the development of environmentally-protected land.
On the national stage, he has run up against Alberta Premier Smith, who has called for a more measured and cautious response to Trump and his tariffs.
That caution has also been practised by other leaders, namely France's Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, both of whom struck a more diplomatic tone in their February visits to the White House.
But Ford's defiant stance against Trump is widely supported in Canada. Polls show the majority of Canadians support retaliating against the US, and a swell of nationalism has since emerged across the country.
While Ford has been forceful, he has also been careful in his direct appeals to Americans.
""Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,"" he said earlier this week when he announced his plan to hike electricity prices, before underscoring that his priority is to protect Ontario jobs.",US & Canada

Investigations correspondent, BBC News•@rianna_croxford","Abercrombie & Fitch must pay for the legal fees of former CEO Mike Jeffries as he defends criminal charges of sex trafficking, a US court has ruled.
The fashion brand, which has previously said it was ""appalled and disgusted"" by Mr Jeffries' alleged conduct, had signed an agreement in 2014 when the ex-CEO resigned, covering him for the costs of any criminal proceedings which arose from his position.
The company had argued in court that the charges, which allege Mr Jeffries ran an international prostitution and sex trafficking business, related to his personal life and not his work.
But a judge found that the ""horrific"" charges, filed last year, were tied to his corporate role.
The court's ruling could have significant financial and legal ramifications for Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) - a billion-dollar public company with more than 750 stores worldwide, including the Hollister brand. Legal experts told the BBC the bill for the company is likely to run into millions of dollars.
The decision also raises questions about why the company made the far-reaching indemnity agreement when Mr Jeffries stepped down more than a decade ago. The BBC has previously asked A&F about the circumstances surrounding this agreement, and if it had been aware of any allegations against Mr Jeffries at the time, but it declined to comment.
Mr Jeffries, who ran the retailer for 22 years, is currently on bail after pleading not guilty to the charges along with his British life partner, Matthew Smith, and their middleman in the alleged trafficking operation, James Jacobson.
The arrests followed a BBC investigation in 2023 that revealed Mr Jeffries and his partner were at the centre of a sophisticated operation scouting young men for sex in the US and abroad.
Ruling that Mr Jeffries' indemnification agreement does cover the criminal charges against him, Judge Paul Fioravanti said: ""In my view, Jeffries's conduct, as alleged in the indictment, as horrific as it is, has a causal connection to his official capacity and status as CEO of Abercrombie.""
The criminal legal costs come in addition to fees in Mr Jeffries' civil cases, which A&F was ordered to pay last year on similar grounds.
Along with Mr Jeffries, A&F is defending multiple civil lawsuits from alleged victims, accusing the brand of having facilitated and funded his ""criminal enterprise"".
""Jeffries' legal fees will be millions of dollars when it's all said and done,"" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.
A former federal prosecutor and partner at Shihata & Geddes, Elizabeth Geddes, added: ""You'll have high-paid lawyers charging by the hour, especially if this leads to both a civil and criminal trial which can be expensive and time-consuming.""
Companies can indemnify executives, even for criminal charges, she said, though this would typically be in cases of white-collar crime such as fraud and not sex trafficking.
Mr Rahmani said the Abercrombie & Fitch agreement was ""unique"" in its coverage of criminal conduct. ""Generally, criminal conduct is not something that you can insure for because it falls outside the scope of any company's business,"" he said.
The criminal charges against Mr Jeffries date from 2008 to 2015. He stepped down as chief executive of A&F in December 2014 after two decades in charge.
US prosecutors allege he had used his wealth, power and status as CEO ""to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure"" and for the pleasure of his partner, Mr Smith.
A&F is not a defendant in the criminal case, but the latest ruling means it will now have to reimburse Mr Jeffries for legal fees dating back to 2023, as well as advance him funds for his ongoing defence.
On top of the legal fees of its former CEO, the company may also face further costs in civil cases it is defending if a court orders compensation to be paid out or both parties agree a settlement.
Despite the severity of the allegations, the company has been reporting record sales, amounting to $4.95bn (£3.84bn) in the past year.
""It doesn't appear as though A&F are at a detriment financially [in sales or share price] due to the lawsuits surrounding Mike Jeffries,"" said Heather Cucolo, a New York Law School professor.
She said it was interesting that the company appeared to have been able to ""spin"" or ""stifle some of the information that's out there"".
Following the BBC's investigation, A&F opened an independent investigation and suspended $1m (£770,000) annual retirement payments to Mr Jeffries.
It added that new leadership has transformed the company, and it has ""zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind"".",US & Canada

Political reporter, BBC News•@_JennyMcKiernan","Sir Keir Starmer has said that the government can make efficiencies by using AI and technology, ahead of the Spring Statement.
The PM told BBC Radio 5 Live that money could come out of government, after Rachel Reeves confirmed civil service departments will be asked to cut 15% from their budgets.
There is political unease among Labour MPs about the scale of cuts to government departments, which the chancellor will outline in her statement on Wednesday. It comes after the government unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving £5bn a year by 2030.
On Monday, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander denied the government was signalling a return towards an austerity model.
Asked by the BBC if cuts would be announced for departments whose spending is not protected, such as the Ministry of Justice, Sir Keir said they were ""looking across the board"" at spending.
""At the budget last year we made some record investments, and we're not going to undo that,"" he added.
He said: ""One of the areas we will be looking at is can we run the government more efficiently, can we take some money out of government, and I think we can.
""We're essentially asking businesses across the country to be more efficient, to look at AI and tech in the way that they do their business.
""I want the same challenge in government, which is why shouldn't we be more efficient, so we will be looking there and in one or two other places.""
Reeves' plan for major money-saving from the welfare budget comes on top of her decision to axe the universal provision of winter fuel payments and only give them to the poorest pensioners.
She told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that government running costs would be cut, with savings made from back office and administrative roles rather than front-line services.
Last month, the government cut the aid budget to boost defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, as leaders across Europe looked to overhaul defence policies over fears the US could make a deal with Russia to end the Ukraine war which leaves the continent vulnerable.
The Treasury has signalled there would be no more tax rises and no more increases in government spending, with the message accompanying the government's approach that the world has changed, and nobody knows what is around the corner.
Challenged on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Alexander highlighted that Labour had increased public spending in its first budget in October.
""We have to take some really very difficult decisions and in terms of welfare we will always make sure that there is a system that provides a safety net for the most vulnerable,"" she said.
""We're investing over £20bn more in the NHS and we've seen waiting lists coming down in hospitals now for the fifth month in a row.
""The Office for Budget Responsibility last year at the time of the budget said it was one of the most expansionist budgets ever, of all time, so we are not returning to austerity.""
Civil Service unions have warned that services could deteriorate with the loss of jobs, with Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Fran Heathcote saying that former prime minister Gordon Brown had attempted to cut backroom staff, and the ""consequences of that was chaos"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjy4m0n1exo,National Grid boss says Heathrow had 'enough power',2025-03-24T09:56:50.137Z,"Tom Symonds
BBC News correspondent
Ruth Comerford
BBC News","National Grid's chief executive has said Heathrow had ""enough power"" from other substations following Friday's fire that caused the airport to shut down.
John Pettigrew told the Financial Times the fire that knocked out a substation was a ""unique event"", but that two other substations remained operational and capable of powering the airport in west London.
Heathrow's chief executive had already said the shutdown it caused was not due to a lack of power, but was due to the time it took to switch from the damaged substation to the other two.
Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander was asked whether she had full confidence in Heathrow's management. She said it was a matter for the airport's board.
The airport halted operations for 18 hours on Friday, causing thousands of flights to be cancelled and leaving passengers stranded across the globe. The incident also disrupted the supply of millions of pounds of goods that go through the airport.
The fire started in a transformer within the electrical substation in Hayes, north of Heathrow, around midnight.
The airport has emergency back-up power supplies, which use diesel generators and batteries, but these only keep crucial safety systems running, such as landing equipment and runway lights.
A separate biomass power generator also provides heat and electricity to Terminal Two.
However, the National Grid is the main source of power for Heathrow.
Mr Pettigrew told the Financial Times he couldn't remember a transformer failing to such an extent in his 30-year career in the industry.
""Losing a substation is a unique event but there were two others available. That is a level of resilience.""
He added: ""There was no lack of capacity from the substations. Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow.""
A Heathrow spokeswoman said that Mr Pettigrew's comments ""confirms that this was an unprecedented incident and that it would not have been possible for Heathrow to operate uninterrupted.
""Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted,"" she said.
""Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.""
Heathrow managers decided to close the airport on safety grounds while they switched to the alternative National Grid supplies.
The airport's chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, told the BBC the delay in reopening was due to the need to ""reallocate"" the power supply - ""closing down and restarting systems which takes a long time"".
He said there were a ""number of systems we have to shut down and then bring them back up and ensure they are safe"".
""It's fuelling systems, it's bridges, it's escalators, all of these systems have to be brought back up [and] tested to ensure they are safe.""
He added that there were risks ""of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them"".
However the duration of the shutdown has infuriated airlines.
Willie Walsh, the former British Airways boss and head of the airline organisation IATA said it was a ""clear planning failure by the airport"" and the systems and procedures for handling power failures are now under the spotlight.
Mr Woldbye, who attracted criticism for claiming the airport had ""come back quite fast"", said he was ""happy"" to answer to the prime minister.
Questioned on whether she remained confident in the decision making of Heathrow's management on BBC Breakfast, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander noted that the airport ""is a private company"".
She added: ""The individuals who need to ask themselves whether they have full confidence in Heathrow management are the Heathrow board.""
More than 63,000 homes also lost power in the outage caused by the fire, according to energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. About 150 people were evacuated from properties surrounding the substation.
Substations, operated by National Grid, are designed to produce, convert, and distribute electricity at suitable voltage levels. Heathrow uses three electricity substations, each with a back-up.
However, the fire put both the substation and its back-up out of action. Heathrow's emergency back-up generation functioned normally.
The government has ordered a six-week investigation into the shutdown that resulted from the fire, led by the National Energy System Operator (Neso).
Alexander said she was not going to ""prejudge"" the Neso report, the initial findings of which are expected in May, nor Heathrow's internal investigation.
She said that she had asked to take a ""very close look"" at Heathrow's report, which will be undertaken by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly.
""Any steps that need to be taken to protect our critical national infrastructure will be taken if those reports recommend particular courses of action,"" she added.
Simon Gallagher, managing director of UK Network Services, a consultancy specialising in power grids, said every airport in the UK had the same ""vulnerability"" to National Grid faults.
He said that a data centre near Heathrow entirely backs up its power sourcing, and that it was a ""fair question to ask"" why the airport had not been protected in the same way.
""It's a hard argument to make to say that data centres are more important than Heathrow,"" Mr Gallagher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",UK
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y08v0n2jyo,Teachers in divorce 'limbo' take pension legal action,2025-03-24T06:30:15.363Z,"Martin Jones & Kaushal Menon Muralidharan
BBC West Investigations","Teachers unable to get divorced because of delays getting their pensions valued are taking legal action against the government.
Hundreds of teachers have been frustrated by long delays that left them ""in limbo"", unable to move on with their lives or plan for their future.
Construction skills lecturer David Quinton, from Gloucestershire, said the legal action was not just about financial compensation but making the government ""realise that they have affected people's mental well being"".
The government, which issued an apology in December, has told the BBC there are now 620 people - including recent applicants - waiting for valuations, down from 3,062 in October 2024.
""I know a statement has been issued with an apology, but I don't think that apology is worth anything truthfully. It's a bit too little, too late,"" Mr Quinton said.
In December, Teachers' Pensions - which runs the scheme on behalf of the Department for Education - said it aimed to clear most of the backlog by the end of February, with the government describing the calculations as ""extremely complex"".
The value of a pension is needed by the courts to decide whether it should be shared with an ex-partner, and without which it is almost impossible to reach a financial settlement.
A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is usually provided within three months of a request being submitted but some teachers have been waiting much longer.
Mr Quinton applied for a CETV in October 2023 as part of divorce proceedings and got it on 29 January this year, 15 months after applying.
Although he has now received his valuation, he said there is ""still a long way to go"" to finalise his divorce.
He now wants to join a group action being brought by the teaching union NASUWT and legal firm Leigh Day against the pension provider and the Department for Education.
""I think it's important that the government need to realise that they have affected people's mental well being. They have affected them financially. And there has to be an impact on them for not doing that,"" he said.
""It's important that those thousands of people [affected] have a voice and the way that we have a voice is by joining this action.""
Mr Quinton estimates that the ""elongated"" process of getting the CETV has now cost him upward of £8,000 in solicitors' bills.
Wendy Dopheide, 60, is an English and drama teacher from Warminster, Wiltshire, and said she would also consider legal action.
""I can't overstate just how stressful this is for people like me in this situation,"" she said.
""By the age of 60, which I am now, many people are starting to look forward to retirement. I can't do that because I have no idea about what my financial situation will be when I do retire and whether I'll be able to afford to live.""
She originally applied for her CETV in August 2023 but is still waiting. She said the December update claiming that the backlog would be cleared by the end of February made her ""hopeful"", but that since then she has been met with a ""stony silence"".
""When I heard about it, I thought 'wow, I can start to move on and get the information that I need',"" she said.
""And I heard nothing back, nothing at all.""
A similar feeling of being left in the dark is shared by Philip Hawkins, a 57-year-old retired art teacher, from Exeter.
He first contacted Teachers' Pensions about a CETV in October last year.
He was told he would have to pay for the valuation and that he would be sent an invoice. It took five months for that invoice to arrive.
""Each time I was calling up, I was told I would get a response within a certain number of days, 10 days, and never would get that response,"" he said.
""When I'd phone up again, I would say 'what's happened to my previous request?' I would get the same answer, that this is being escalated and we'll get back to you and each time no one ever gets back to me.
""I've felt like throwing my phone out the window and knocking my head against the wooden table because I felt there's nothing I can do here.""
He received and paid an invoice for the CETV earlier this month, but said that he is ""very anxious"" that he could be waiting another year or two for the valuation.
""It's very tiring and it's something that wears away at you.""
Ryan Bradshaw, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, is leading the lawsuit.
""There's a clear statutory obligation within the legislation that states that Teachers' Pensions must provide CETV calculations within three months of any request,"" Mr Bradshaw said.
""We've got people who've been waiting in excess of 12 months for a calculation.
""They've been let down by the pension scheme administrators. They've been let down by the Department for Education... and then they're let down by the regulators and the (Pensions) Ombudsman, who've allowed this situation to persist for so long.""
In an update to its members last week, Teachers' Pensions again apologised for the ongoing delays.
It had previously explained that a judgement, known as the McCloud pension remedy, resulted in the government making changes to public service pension schemes, and calculating valuations in a new way.
Teachers' Pensions said that it had been waiting on guidance to be produced and that preparing that took ""a long time to agree for consistency [across all public service pension schemes] and to ensure calculations don't need to be revisited"".
In December, the Department for Education said the delays were not a result of having too few staff.
Teachers' Pensions has now confirmed that 80% of that backlog has been cleared, and that it is looking at other options to provide the remaining applicants with their valuations in lieu of a CETV.
Capita, who is the current administrator of the Teachers' Pensions scheme, said the delays have been outside of its control and it is ""continuing to work closely with the Department for Education to complete the remaining cases"".
Meanwhile Mr Bradshaw recommends that any teachers affected by the delays pay attention to the outcome of the case.
""The main thing is that this is being brought as a collective action and.... the changes that arise as a result of any legal action can have a wider impact than just the group of those people that we're representing.""
He urged people to speak to their own union representatives and keep up pressure on Teachers' Pensions and the Secretary of State for Education.
""It's just a case of creating pressure from every single angle. It's not just about bringing legal action, it's also about bringing to bear some form of political pressure as well to try and get a resolution to the wider issues.""

Business reporters, BBC News","Councils in England must show how they are improving roads and tackling what the government describes as a ""pothole plague"" or lose out on millions of pounds in funding.
The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by £500m from mid-April.
However, it said English councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on pothole fixing or lose a quarter of that extra funding.
The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than ""reactively"" fixing potholes.
Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost £17bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.
According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.
All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.
The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.
The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said broken roads were ""not only risking lives but also cost working families, drivers and businesses hundreds - if not thousands of pounds - in avoidable vehicle repairs"".
He added that councils have the cash to get on with the job.
However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, told the BBC the amount of money was ""nowhere near the amount that is needed"".
""The implication that we are not spending it well, is not helpful,"" she said, adding that the government was announcing ""stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics"".
""It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,"" she said.
She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall £410m while the money the government was ""re-announcing"" for the whole of England was £500m.
""Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.""
Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was ""not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole"".
Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to ""comply with these requirements"".
""We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,"" she said.
Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.
By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.
The DfT added that councils who ""fail to meet these strict conditions"" will see 25% of the funding withheld.
During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.
The LGA said it was in ""everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent"".
""This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,"" it added.
Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a ""pothole sticking plaster"".
He said: ""Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines.""
The Liberal Democrats transport spokesman Paul Kohler called for a ""more sustainable approach"" to repairs, saying fixing individual potholes was welcome but did little to address a ""crumbling road infrastructure"".

BBC News","Wales is the most difficult part of Great Britain for first-time buyers to get onto the property ladder in their local area, according to new data.
A home affordability index report published by Skipton Group building society found six out of the 10 least affordable areas of Britain were in Wales.
The index, based on data from the building society, Office for National Statistics (ONS), Bank of England and Land Registry, considers a range of factors including house prices in local areas as well as the average income of potential first-time buyers in those areas.
The Welsh government said it understood the difficulties facing first-time buyers and had extended the Help to Buy Wales scheme.
Ceredigion and Powys were found to be the least affordable areas of Wales for first-time buyers to get a home where they grew up.
According to the ONS, the average house prices in Ceredigion is £236,000, higher than the Wales average.
That is despite the county having ""the seventh lowest median income in Great Britain"" and means less than 3% of potential first-time buyers living in the area can afford to buy, according to the report.
Owen Shiers, 40, a freelance musician who lives in a social housing co-operative near Eglwys-fach, Ceredigion, said he had ""given up"" on owning his own home.
Mr Shiers pays rent and, with the other tenants, is responsible for managing and maintaining the house.
He said he was not surprised Ceredigion came bottom of the affordability league.
""I think people forget that Ceredigion is one of the poorest areas of northern Europe,"" said Mr Shiers.
""There's gross inequality between the people who maybe have grown up here and who are part of the economic system in Ceredigion, and the people who often come from the big cities who have a lot of money.""
Mr Shiers said he had thought about buying a house but ""it seems so insurmountable to me, given my own economic situation.
""I have worried about it, but I've kind of given up. It just seems impossible.""
He said he was worried about the impact on Ceredigion.
""I see it having a far wider effect on the Welsh language and Welsh culture and the ability of young people to stay in the places where they've grown up.
""My sister couldn't afford to buy a house in the village where we grew up. She's got a young family and had to move quite far away.
""We often only find out how bad that has been when it's too late. It's a bit like watching a car crash in slow motion. You feel powerless to stop it.""
Source: Skipton Group Home Affordability Index Report
Stuart Haire, Skipton Group's chief executive, said people ""might expect London and the south-east to dominate the least affordable areas for first-time buyers, so it's shocking to see Wales feature so heavily"".
""The first step onto the property ladder remains by far the hardest, but for Welsh first-time buyers, it must feel impossible.
""Our new data shows just how stark their affordability challenge is.""
Tania Dutnell, an estate agent in Ceredigion, said another issue affecting first-time buyers in the county was the type of properties for sale.
She said while there were a ""lot of large properties"" there were not many smaller or terraced homes available.
""There's lots of different properties on the higher end of the stock market"", said Ms Dutnell.
She also said interest rate rises in recent years had made things more difficult.
""For the first time buyers, you've got options of staying with parents, and the bank of mum and dad to help to get deposits together.
""Or you are in rented accommodation [which] is very expensive, and all the money that you earn tends to go onto that, so it's very hard to save.""
Ceredigion council said its planning department had a target of 20% of all houses to be affordable across the county.
It said that target has been exceeded, with 37% of permitted houses and 33% of all houses built since the adoption of the Local Development Plan being affordable.
A council spokesperson added: ""The council has also introduced a Community Housing Scheme, an equity sharing product, to support people to get on the housing ladder.""
The Welsh government said it understood the difficulties facing first-time buyers.
A spokesperson said: ""In December, we launched the extension of our Help to Buy Wales scheme which has helped more than 14,500 people who could not afford to buy a home.
""Our Self Build Wales scheme also creates opportunities for people to build homes through loan funding for land and development costs.""",UK

BBC News, Yorkshire","The first case of bird flu in sheep has been found in the UK, the nation's chief veterinary officer has confirmed.
The exact location of the farm has not been revealed, but a government spokesperson said the case was identified on a site in Yorkshire where bird flu had been confirmed in captive birds.
The spokesperson said the single infected sheep had been ""humanely culled"" and no further cases among the flock were found after ""extensive testing"".
""There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk to the nation's livestock population,"" they added.
Christine Middlemiss, the UK's chief veterinary officer, said ""strict"" measures had been put in place to prevent the further spread of the disease.
She added: ""While the risk to livestock remains low, I urge all animal owners to ensure scrupulous cleanliness is in place and to report any signs of infection to the Animal Plant Health Agency immediately.""
Bird flu, also known as avian influenza or H5N1, is a disease caused by a virus that infects birds and sometimes other animals.
Dr Meera Chand, emerging infection lead at the UK Health Security Agency, said current evidence ""suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating around the world do not spread easily to people"".
Dr Chand added: ""The risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low.""
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 1.78 million farmed and captive birds had been culled between November and February due to the spread of the disease across the UK.
A government spokesperson said the infected sheep was a female who had been showing signs of mastitis, an inflammation of the breast tissue.
The lambs of the affected ewe tested negative for bird flu, the spokesperson added.
While this is the first time this virus has been reported in a sheep, bird flu has previously been detected in livestock in other countries, according to Defra.
The National Sheep Association (NSA), which represents the views and interests of sheep producers in the UK, said mixing different animals was ""questionable at the best of times, but should be avoided when England is undergoing a period of mandatory housing measures for poultry due to bird flu outbreaks"".
The Yorkshire farm where the case was found was a smallholding where sheep and poultry were being kept together, a spokesperson added.
NSA Chief Executive Phil Stocker said the positive case was ""not a threat to food safety of consumers"".
Defra has placed England in an ""avian influenza protection zone"" to prevent bird flu and stop it spreading.
Thirteen regions have also seen mandatory housing measures introduced, which state that birds must be kept inside.
They are Cheshire, Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, Herefordshire, Lancashire, Merseyside, Norfolk, North Yorkshire, Shropshire, Suffolk, Worcestershire, and York.
The Food Standards Agency said properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, remained safe to eat.

BBC News NI crime and justice correspondent","Human remains exhumed from a grave in County Monaghan four months ago are not those of Joe Lynskey, the organisation set up to find the Disappeared has said.
Mr Lynskey, from west Belfast, is one of the Disappeared - a group of 17 people who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried during The Troubles in Northern Ireland.
DNA test results do not match those of the family to whom the grave belongs to either, or any of the remaining Disappeared, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) said.
The Irish police service, An Garda Síochána, has notified the local coroner and said attempts had begun to find out who the remains belonged to.
Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said he was ""saddened to hear"" the exhumation in the search for Mr Lynskey's remains has not been successful.
""My thoughts are with his family, who have faced decades of uncertainty and heartache,"" Benn added in a statement.
He has urged anyone who may have information that could locate Mr Lynskey's remains, or those of the remaining Disappeared, ""to come forward in confidence to the ICLVR"".
The ICLVR carried out the exhumation at Annyalla cemetery in November, after receiving information about suspicious activity at a grave during the 1970s.
The timeframe and the location coincided with Mr Lynskey's disappearance.
The ICLVR confirmed the outcome of tests on the remains in a statement.
It described the news as ""deeply disappointing"" for Mr Lynskey's family.
""The results of the DNA examination have now eliminated them as being those of the family to whom the grave belongs and now also eliminated them as being those of Joe Lynskey or any of the Disappeared,"" the ICLVR said.
""All the interested parties including the Lynskey family have been informed.
""We know that this news is deeply disappointing for the Lynskey family and the thoughts of everyone in the commission are with them at this most difficult time.
""We are also conscious that this was a distressing experience for the family whose grave was opened to facilitate the exhumation.
""We are grateful for their co-operation and support at all stages of the process.""
Jon Hill, the lead investigator of the ICLVR, said it was ""cruel"" for the Lynskey family, but that it would now progress with a number of other strands of information.
""The Commission is completely committed to this cause,"" he told BBC News NI.
""There was never definitive information saying this is where Joe Lynskey was buried.
""They [the Lynskey family] have been disappointed before, it is just so cruel that it is the same family that this event has happened to now on two occasions.
""It is especially cruel, but I don't know what more we can do about that, we can only undertake what we believe to be right.
""We have tried to manage their expectations throughout, but of course they will have expectations and hopes.""
The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin, said he was ""sorry"" for the Lynskey family and the family to whom the grave belongs.
""I can only imagine how distressing it has been for them, as well,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.
""I think this really reminds us, it really does, about the difficulties and the awful legacy of our past and how we are very conscious now of finding ways of really helping all families to be able to cope with the awful legacy and hurts of what happened in our conflict.
""I think the families of the Disappeared have been amazing witnesses for us and very courageously showing us about how they can comfort one another even through awful and terrible times like it has been for the Lynskey family this last number of months.""
The Disappeared are a group of 17 people whose bodies were buried at secret locations between 1972 and 1985.
The remains of 13 have been found so far.
The ICLVR has said it will do ""everything in its power"" to recover the remains of the four others.
""We would again appeal to anyone with information relating to Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh, Robert Nairac or Seamus Maguire to bring it to the ICLVR where it will be treated in the strictest confidence.""
A former Cistercian monk from the Beechmount area of west Belfast, Mr Lynskey later joined the IRA.
Mr Lynskey went missing in 1972, and republicans have claimed he was ""executed and buried"" by the IRA.
The latest search for his remains was in 2018. It ended without success.
Last November, his niece said that his body ""needs to be brought home"".
The plight of the Disappeared has been further highlighted in recent months due to the release of the Disney+ series, Say Nothing.
The drama focuses on events during the Troubles, including the disappearance of mother of 10 Jean McConville as well as Kevin McKee, Seamus Wright and Joe Lynskey.",UK

Culture reporter","Former Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis has said the show will lose some of its live ""magic"", after the BBC confirmed it will move to a fully pre-recorded format having filmed its last live episodes after 67 years.
The longest-running children's show in the world, which first aired in 1958, has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades, the corporation said.
But it has decided to put an end to its live episodes ""as viewing habits change"".
Ellis, who once had to handle a tarantula live on the show, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: ""I feel sorry for this generation of presenters who aren't going to feel that thrill.""
""There is something of an adrenaline rush to doing things live, because things can go wrong, but I think it's also the magic when they go right,"" she added.
""It's the best example of teamwork I can think of because you are just as important as everyone else in the studio. And I'm sure there were nervous cameramen, but we all had to do it together and no one could go again because it wasn't quite right the first time.""
Ellis worked on the show from 1983 to 1987, in the days before autocues and producers talking in presenters' ears.
She suggested the ""jeopardy"" and ""magic"" created in live moments is probably ""the reason why up until now, it has continued to be live in the face of everything else changing around it.""
Despite the changes to the filming format, she said Blue Peter remains a ""timeless"" show, however.
Fellow former presenters Simon Thomas and Richard Bacon expressed their disappointment at the news over the weekend, with Bacon saying ""being live is what made it alive"".
Thomas, now a Sky Sports presenter, posted on Instagram: ""We probably didn't realise it at the time, but we were working in the last years of the golden age of children's TV, a time when children's programmes filled the afternoons and Saturday mornings on BBC One and ITV.
""An era when audiences were measured in the millions rather than the thousands.
""I don't say golden in arrogant way; but everything has fragmented now and the way children consume entertainment has changed forever. There will never be another era like it again.""
Bacon said he ""loved"" the long-running series and described it as ""a big, well-made, lovingly made, really well resourced live kids' TV show. That had been live in that building for decades"".
""It was a magical experience (for, you know, all of 20 months).""
The presenter was sacked from the show in the 1990s after admitting drug taking but returned for its 60th anniversary, receiving a famous Blue Peter badge.
Blue Peter, which features viewer and presenter challenges, interviews and animal action, will continue to be filmed in Salford and broadcast on CBBC and BBC Two as well as on iPlayer.
""The programme has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades and has transitioned to a pre-record model as viewing habits change,"" said a BBC spokesperson.
""Blue Peter continues to be loved by generations across the UK.
""As we continue to navigate a challenging market and young audience viewing habits evolve, it is necessary to make some changes to ensure that BBC Studios Kids and Family Productions delivers a dynamic, digital-first brand that will future-proof the show and sustain its legacy for years to come.""
The current presenting line-up includes Shini Muthukrishnan, Joel Mawhinney and Abby Cook, who are joined by Henry the dog.",UK

BBC News","The mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey said she does not believe social media companies would put ""lives before profit"".
Esther Ghey was speaking at the screening of a new ITV documentary, Brianna: A Mother's Story, which explores the death of her 16-year-old daughter, who was murdered by two teenagers.
Scarlet Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, who were both 15 at the time, lured Brianna to a park in Cheshire on 11 February 2023, where she was stabbed 28 times with a hunting knife.
The 75-minute film celebrates Brianna's life and features interviews with three of her friends, while also examining issues around online safety.
Brianna - who was transgender - struggled with her mental health which was worsened by accessing eating disorder and self-harm content on X.
She had thousands of followers on TikTok, with some of the videos she posted going viral.
From the age of 14, Jenkinson was drawn to videos on the dark web of real killing and torture, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers.
Speaking at the documentary screening, Ms Ghey said one of the reasons she had chosen to take part was to ""get answers"" from social media companies about safety.
""At this point, I really do not believe that any social media company will put lives before profit.""
She added that she wanted to ensure ""my family's story was told truthfully, and people could get to know Brianna the way we did"".
In the film, Ms Ghey spoke in depth for the first time about her ""beautiful daughter"" and how the devastating loss had driven her campaign for change.
On her campaigning work on online safety and trolling, she said she supported a ban for under-16s on the ""absolute cesspit"" of social media.
""Even if, say, if I do an interview I'll try not to look at comments, but I can never help myself,"" she said.
""I'll look at the comments and you'll see people saying about my child, trying to tell me what gender my child was, and also really, really horrific comments too.""
She added that this was mentioned in the documentary and that when things were reported there was no support.
""I've reported so many comments, and I always get the response that they haven't done anything wrong, that it's not something that they can take down, and our children have access to those comments.""
""No matter how much love and compassion you pump into your child when you're bringing them up, how much empathy you can teach them, they will then go online and they'll see the way that people are speaking about others and they might think that's right.
""And that's without even going into the amount of harm that's online, like the dangerous challenges where young people are losing their lives due to these sick challenges.
""People uploading misogyny, hate, misinformation, and that is just the tip of the iceberg,"" she said.
In deeply personal conversations, she discussed her ongoing campaign to make the UK safer for children and called for a public inquiry into peer-on-peer violence, why it is on the rise, and what can be done to stop it happening.
She also looks at whether social media is making children harm themselves or others.
Ms Ghey had previously met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, as well as his predecessor Rishi Sunak, to discuss the issue, and had criticised the Online Safety Act for not going far enough.
She has campaigned for an age limit on smartphone use, stricter controls on access to social media apps, tougher action on knife crime and for mindfulness to be taught in schools.
""We need to make people realise that we, as consumers, have the power.
""If we all decide to keep our children off social media or to give them a 'brick' phone, we can vote with our money.
""Brianna was genuinely addicted and I understand the signs of addiction because I have been an addict. Teenagers are often glued to their tablets eight hours a day. That's not healthy.""
The film explores Brianna's upbringing in Warrington through interviews with her her sister Alisha, as well as her close friends, who describe her as kind, chatty and funny. They speak about the ""wonderful"" and ""amazing"" person Brianna was, and speak about her trans journey.
The documentary includes detectives from Cheshire Police who speak about the investigation into her murder and reveal for the first time how they quickly built up their case to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Ms Ghey said she hoped that documentary ""contributed to the push for our children's welfare, online and offline"".
The social media companies all refused to be part of the documentary and have declined a meeting with Ms Ghey.
Meta, X and TikTok have been contacted for comment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87zjn97epo,Experts to investigate student loan fraud claims,2025-03-23T18:13:27.566Z,"André Rhoden-Paul
BBC News","The education secretary has asked counter-fraud experts to lead an investigation into reports millions of pounds in student loans are being claimed by people with no intent to study.
It follows a report in the Sunday Times which says it found evidence of some individuals enrolling on degree courses at small colleges just to access loans, with no intention of paying them back.
Bridget Phillipson has called in the Public Sector Fraud Authority (PSFA) to coordinate the government's response to the allegations and to support investigations already under way.
Writing in the Sunday Times, she said it pointed to ""one of the biggest financial scandals in the history of our universities sector"".
The newspaper said most of the students under scrutiny are believed to be at franchised universities - small colleges paid to provide courses for established universities.
It claimed there is a concern about the potential ""organised recruitment"" of Romanian nationals in particular to enrol on courses.
Student Loans Company (SLC) also identified suspicious applications involving fake documents and address duplication, along with franchised colleges enrolling students who can not speak adequate English, the paper said.
Phillipson said SLC had been working with law-enforcement agencies to investigate the prevalence of some Romanian students at certain colleges, but not enough was being done to stop wider abuse.
""But today's revelations demand that we must go further and faster to protect the public purse.
""I will not tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money being misused,"" she wrote.
She added franchising in some universities had been ""less about expanding access and more about meeting expanding overheads"", and the Office for Students (OfS) - the independent regulator of higher education in England - should have provided ""guardrails"" in this area.
Ms Phillipson said she plans to bring forward legislation to ensure the OfS has new powers to protect public money.
The UK's student loan debt currently stands at £236.2bn.
Students, including overseas students with settled status, can take out government-subsidised loans to help towards their maintenance costs and to cover the cost of tuition fees.
The tuition fees are paid directly to a university or education provider, while the maintenance loan is paid directly to a student's bank account in instalments.
Students need to repay their loan but not until they earn a certain amount after graduation - with the amounts currently ranging from £24,990 to £31,395 depending on which part of the UK they are based.
In England, the loans are eventually written off after 40 years.
The Public Sector Fraud Authority is part of the Cabinet Office and Treasury and works with the government and public bodies on reducing fraud.
The Department for Education said in a statement it had already taken action to crack down on rogue franchise operators to tackle fraud and it would ""overhaul regulation"" so the OfS better protected taxpayer money.
A spokesperson said: ""Where misuse or fraud is found we have powers to claw back payments – and we won't hesitate to use them.
""We will bring in tough new laws to ensure the OfS can quickly stop bad actors gaming the system once and for all.""
OfS chief executive Susan Lapworth said the ""sharp practices"" alleged in the Sunday Times investigation were ""entirely unacceptable"" and ""represent shocking misuse of public funding"".
She added OfS would work with the education department and SLC to address the issues.
Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - said it supported the government's proposal to require franchise partners to register with OfS.
""If there is evidence of criminal behaviour, we completely agree that it must be rooted out,"" said a spokesman, adding that universities had taken ""extensive actions to tighten controls"" over the last two years.
He added: ""We should also remember the legitimate and important role of some franchise provision in meeting the needs of students for whom the traditional model of higher education may be difficult to fit around work commitments, or where study closer to home is essential.""",UK
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgd74zl2xpo,"My baby's premature birth was humbling, says Beatrice",2025-03-23T19:07:20.608Z,"Zahra Fatima
BBC News","Princess Beatrice has described the premature birth of her daughter as ""humbling"".
Her daughter Athena Elizabeth Rose was born several weeks premature at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 22 January. She weighed 4lb 5oz (2kg).
""Nothing quite prepares you for the moment when you realise your baby is going to arrive early,"" the granddaughter of the late Queen Elizabeth II wrote in British Vogue on Sunday, adding, ""there's so little control.""
The 36-year-old, who earlier this month was appointed as the new patron of prematurity charity Borne, said she was now trying to put a spotlight on female health.
News of the princess's second pregnancy was announced by Buckingham Palace in October last year.
However, routine scans soon revealed their ""precious cargo"" needed close monitoring, and Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi were told to prepare for an early arrival.
""What I learnt in this process has been humbling,"" wrote the princess.
Despite acknowledging how fortunate she was to have access to a ""remarkable"" medical team, Beatrice revealed the uncertainty she experienced left her with ""an overwhelming fear of the unknown"".
She wrote: ""Like countless other expectant mums, I lay awake in the weeks leading up to birth, trying to monitor each movement of the baby in my tummy and asking myself a thousand times 'What if this happens, or what if that happens?'""
Describing how Athena looked when she was born, Beatrice wrote the newborn had been ""so tiny it took more than a few weeks for the tears of relief to dry"".
She said: ""I'm extremely pleased to let you know Athena is now doing really well, I have a few more answers as to what happened, but still no precise explanation.""
Beatrice expressed her hopes sharing her story would support other mothers going through the same uncertainty and that women's health ""has been left off the agenda"".
""My joys and fears in pregnancy and motherhood are the same as those experienced by millions of other women around the world,"" she added.
The princess married her millionaire property tycoon husband in a private ceremony in 2020. The pair also share a three-year-old daughter named Sienna.
Mr Mapelli Mozzi has an eight-year-old son named Wolfie, from a previous relationship.
Princess Beatrice, who is ninth in line to the throne, is the eldest daughter of the Duke of York and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York.
She has worked with a number of charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and co-founding the Big Change, which helps young people to develop life skills, beyond academic subjects.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn8n3nyrlo,"NHS maternity care failures: A lack of 'skills, finances or drive to change,' says expert",2025-03-24T02:46:42.129Z,"Michael Buchanan
Social Affairs Correspondent","By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.
Inscribed underneath is a short verse: ""Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.""
When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: ""We will never forget what happened. We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.""
Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.
Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.
What her parents were put through on that day – and in the years since – goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.
The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.
The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.
That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.
Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.
""We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,"" says Ms Robinson.
Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.
What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife – shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.
""The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.""
Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that ""they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby"".
As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.
By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.
Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as ""not worth the paper it was written on"".
They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) – a body that examined questionable maternity care – clearly stating their shortcomings.
""Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,"" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. ""Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.""
Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.
Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.
""We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.""
Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.
In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.
And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.
Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.
In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.
About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.
""While we identified pockets of excellent practice,"" wrote the CQC, ""we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.""
Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units ""didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.""
Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.
""It's deeply distressing,"" says Dr Kirkup. ""It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.""
Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.
Many of the failures he'd found there – poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them – were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.
He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.
Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.
The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.
The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.
As the report had said, ""there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture"" in the trust's maternity units, including ""disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester"".
In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.
It said: ""We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.""
Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. ""It's been a devil of a job,"" he claims, ""to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.""
The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.
It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.
The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would ""go after the people responsible.
""I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,"" he added.
Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.
The Department of Health says it is ""unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place"".
Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.
NHS Resolution said that inquiries ""do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law"".
In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out £1.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.
""NHS resolution is this anonymous body,"" says Derek Richford, ""that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.""
There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.
Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.
""Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,"" said Prof Walker, ""we know what the problems are.""
What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.
Streeting has said he will ""fix our maternity services"", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. ""I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,"" says Dr Kirkup.
Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.
""The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,"" he says, ""it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.
""One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.""
Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.
Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. ""We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing – they're certainly saying the right thing,"" he says.
""[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.""
As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.
Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.
""Those families went through what we're going through now,"" says Sarah. ""But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.
""I hope something does change.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpyjng041o,John Cooper Clarke: 'A national treasure? I hate that',2025-03-24T01:57:54.363Z,"Ian Youngs
Culture reporter","John Cooper Clarke is about to become the first poet to headline a UK arena, and is responsible for the lyrics to one of the world's most streamed songs of recent years. But he has lost none of the sharp-tongued vitriol of his punk origins.
To a sizeable portion of the nation, Clarke's 50-year stream of biting beat poetry and kitchen sink stand-up comedy should qualify him for national treasure status.
He's horrified at the suggestion.
""I hate that,"" he shoots back. ""I think it sounds like you're knocking on heaven's door.
""National treasure? Shnational shmeasure. Nah, I hate that. National treasure? Not while I'm alive. Not unless it comes with a generous stipend. Then I'll think about it.""
This invective is delivered with a sneer, a wink, and finally a cackle of laughter.
The only stipend in his line of work is the antiquated allowance that's given to the poet laureate.
""What do you get for that, poet laureate? £70 a year and a barrel of sherry? Not interested."" He cackles loudly again.
Clarke has been too rebellious a figure to be considered for poet laureate and its sherry-based salary, and at the age of 76 he argues he still has time to disqualify himself from being a fully paid-up national treasure.
""I could yet blot my copy book. I'm that foul-mouthed [person] that you've come to dredge up some grudging affection for, but I may yet do the wrong thing.""
For someone who has always gone against the grain, and occasionally off the rails, it is hard to imagine what he could do now to diminish his status, however.
One honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.
Although not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM.
It was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40.
Many of Clarke's poems were originally released with musical backings masterminded by producer Martin Hannett, who was known for his work with Joy Division.
Clarke has mixed feelings about the results.
""It was never my idea to put my poetry to music but I couldn't think of an argument against it,"" he says.
""So it was a new adventure for me, but I think the results were patchy. When it was good, it was great. But I'm hyper-critical of my own stuff.
""It wasn't my idea, that's all I'm saying, but I'm glad I did it now. It's put me in line for this award, for a start.""
Two days after that ceremony, Clarke will achieve another landmark moment when he headlines Manchester's Co-op Live arena, albeit with a scaled-back set-up compared with its full 23,500 capacity.
Has he ever performed in an arena? ""I've done outdoor shows that I suppose qualify as an arena,"" he says. ""But I've never done an arena with a lid on it like this one before.""
It will be a far cry from the cabaret clubs where he started out in the city in the 60s, and the punk nights where he made his name in the 70s, after winning over hostile fans who initially aimed spit and bottles in his direction.
So what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?
""The more the merrier,"" he replies. ""If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.""
He performed live with Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, The Fall and Elvis Costello, achieving cult status with social-realist poems like Beasley Street and Evidently Chickentown, the antisocial I Don't Wanna Be Nice, and the more surrealist (I Married A) Monster From Outer Space and Valley of the Lost Women.
However, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.
""Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.""
Clarke eventually got clean after meeting his wife Evie, and his professional revival really began when Evidently Chickentown was used over the end credits of an episode in the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.
Fellow poets, comedians and musicians lined up to hail his influence in a 2012 BBC documentary, with Steve Coogan speaking about his ""spirit of dissent"", and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, calling him ""my hero"".
Turner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.
The original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. ""I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,"" it begins.
Clarke originally released the poem on record with a kitsch musical backing in 1982.
""It should have been done like Alex does it from the start,"" he says. ""I mean, that is the definitive version. I love it.""
The Arctics' version continues to strike a chord with a new generation and last year it had more streams around the world than any other track over a decade old.
Meanwhile, the poem has also become a popular choice as a wedding reading.
""I'd be a billionaire if I had a quid for every person that recited that poem at their wedding,"" Clarke remarks.
He may not have that income stream, but he will have got a fraction of a penny for each of the song's three billion streams.

Culture reporter•@NoorNanji","This week, Million Dollar Secret hits our screens - it's being dubbed Netflix's answer to The Traitors.
But that's not all the week has in store.
InZoi, a new game seen as a direct competitor to The Sims, is coming out, Mumford & Sons are back with a new album, and Holland - starring Nicole Kidman - drops on Amazon Prime.
Read on for this week's biggest releases...
I've just about recovered from the drama of The Traitors, but Netflix is here with its own version to fill that void.
Million Dollar Secret, a competition reality show, drops on Wednesday
So here’s the premise. Twelve strangers enter a fancy lakeside estate. In each of their rooms is a mysterious welcome gift - a box. Eleven are empty, and one contains (you guessed it) a million dollars.
The cash is for that guest to keep, as long as they keep their identity hidden. But a series of games will reveal clues about who they are.
When the trailer dropped on YouTube, people were quick to spot the similarities with The Traitors.
I’ve had a sneak preview, and can confirm there are a lot of parallels - from the awkward group meals, to the tearful revelations of why they really, really need the money.
One thing it doesn’t have, though, is Claudia and her enviable wardrobe. Instead, it’s hosted by British actor Peter Serafinowicz, who told me the game would be “high stakes” with “endless twists”.

Has there ever really been a game to rival The Sims, the virtual dollhouse game that lets you design your own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs?
It has been a hit for 25 years now - but perhaps a challenger has emerged, or so the online hype would have you believe.
InZoi is in effect The Sims, with many similar features but one massive difference - far more realistic and even, at times, lifelike graphics.
The developers want the game to simulate life like never before - with open worlds you can walk (and drive) around, as well as jobs you'll actively play yourself.
Will it be a hit? We'll have to wait to find that out - but after two years of teases and trailers, PC gamers will finally get their hands on the game when it launches in early access form on Friday.
By Mark Savage, music correspondent
Mumford & Sons have timed their comeback perfectly.
Their fifth album, Rushmere, arrives on Friday - just as the Americana sound they championed enjoys a revival, and newcomers like Myles Smith are citing the band as an influence.
Recorded over two years in Nashville and Devon, it finds the group returning to their rustic roots. Guitars are plucked, fiddles are fiddled, and brows are furrowed as Marcus Mumford navigates his mid-30s, and the reorganisation of friendships and priorities that mid-life brings.
Highlights include the understated campfire ballad Monochrome, and the spiky Truth (""I refuse to offer myself up to men who lie""), which is underpinned by a surprisingly nimble bassline.
Named after the pond on Wimbledon Common where they formed, it's a fairly cautious return, presumably designed to remind people of why they fell for the band in the first place. There's certainly nothing as experimental as last year's one-off single, Good People, recorded with Pharrell Williams.
But Marcus Mumford says they recorded more than 60 songs during the sessions, which he called ""the most prolific two years of our life"", and there are plans to release the extra material in one form or another. Watch this space.
Nicole Kidman is the queen of creepy thrillers.
She’s back in Holland, which drops on Amazon Prime on Thursday, and also stars Succession’s Matthew Macfadyen.
The film’s trailer shows Kidman living a Stepford Wives-style life in a small town, with a forced smile as she declares “it’s just perfect”.
But things quickly unravel and secrets, paranoia and suspicion start to mount.
Reviews have been mixed. The Guardian gave it just two stars, calling it a “disappointing mess”, while the Hollywood Reporter called it “stylish but plodding”.
But the Evening Standard was more optimistic. “Forget Babygirl, this is the Nicole Kidman movie to watch,” it writes.",UK

Culture and Media Editor•@katierazz
Tom Brooks-Pollock
Newsnight","The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.
Peter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became ""conversations in rooms"" instead.
He argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.
The Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.
Kosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still ""too great"" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.
""That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.""
Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell, executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.
He said the original script ""had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist – and we had to cut everything"".
He said he was still ""incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all"".
But the original concept was a programme with ""more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms"".
Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.
Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.
One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are ""gone"".
Kosminsky also believes there is ""no way"" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.
Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.
""It would have been a slightly different version of it,"" Thorne told the BBC.
""In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.
""I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.""
The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.
And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.
Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was ""a serious issue"".
""Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,"" he said.
Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be ""a real shame"" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.
Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant ""a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country"", he said.
Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.
Spence said there was ""no way"" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.
Figures out last month from the BFI showed £5.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for £598m, down 22% on the previous year.
Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.
But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?
In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them ""one-sided, anti-competitive policies"" that ""violate American sovereignty"".
On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was ""at risk of losing the very stories that define us"".
""We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,"" she said.
She recently told a House of Commons committee she would like to see an uplift in tax relief for high end television, similar to the one already given to the film sector.",UK

BBC Scotland News","As musical role models go, chart-topping DJ Calvin Harris sets a pretty high bar with countless hits to his credit.
In his hometown of Dumfries, however, he is involved in a smaller venture as an owner of a little pub which is helping the local music scene to thrive.
He is part of a group called To The Nines which bought the Coach and Horses on the Whitesands a couple of years ago.
It has been praised by bands, music organisations and people working to revive the town centre for the boost it is giving to the south of Scotland town where the global superstar grew up.
Harris - whose real name is Adam Wiles - has previously shown a commitment to the area where he was raised when he offered to help out workers affected by the closure of a fish factory in Annan.
He is listed under his real name as a director of To The Nines Ltd, along with his friend Mark Irving.
A report in The Sun recently highlighted how he had gone back to his home town to make his investment.
Title deeds show the group bought the Coach and Horses in August 2023 for £190,000 and it has continued to build on its reputation as a local music venue.
The pub is one of a growing number of venues in Dumfries helping give a platform to local bands.
Hagen Patterson, director of the Dumfries Music Collective (DMC) which aims to provide musical opportunities to young people in the region, said they had always recognised the Coach and Horses as an ""iconic grassroots music venue"".
""We have witnessed some great artistry to come out of the pub over many years,"" he said.
He said it could offer a ""leg up"" to local artists and it was great that such a worldwide star had helped allow it to do so.
""Performing live for the first time, even if just for a handful of listeners, provides invaluable experience,"" he said.
""It's a chance to try out brand new material, gauge reactions, and build a local fan base.
""We are delighted that Calvin and Mark have ensured the longevity of the Coach and Horses, this helps foster our scene.""
Kissing The Flint recently played at the pub having started gigging in Dumfries a few years ago having moved from Australia.
The band's Leah Chynoweth-Tidy said the site had quickly won their hearts.
""All the staff are so supportive and welcoming, really love their live music and are super proud of their historic, vibrant wee venue, which well they should be,"" she said.
""It's always a fantastic experience playing there as the audience are open to any kind of genre and are incredibly responsive and enthusiastic about our original music, which is becoming a rarer thing these days in many venues.
""The Coach feels like coming home for us every time we play there, and all who sail in her have become part of our music family.""
Andy McMillan, frontman with Dumfries three-piece the Dogz, has similar praise.
""The Coach is an awesome grassroots venue,"" he said.
""All the staff are passionate about live music and supporting local bands, whether established acts or those just cutting their teeth in front of an audience.
""It's always a top gig for us and although it's a small venue its contribution to the local music scene is huge.""
Just along the road from the pub, Rab Smith runs the record shop Domino Entertainment and is a former chairman of the town's retailers' association.
He said he believed the area could be at the heart of boosting nightlife in Dumfries.
""The whole Whitesands could be a great entertainment centre,"" he said.
""The old tourist board building could be spectacular.""
He also said it was good to see a local boy made good like Harris putting something back into the community.
""It is a great wee pub - it is too small to be a King Tut's - but it is great that somebody is putting money into it and keeping it alive,"" he added.
Richie Nicoll chairs the Dumfries Town Board which aims to boost regeneration of the town centre.
He said the pub was a ""true gem"" for the town.
""It's always buzzing when live bands perform, and on sunny days, the crowds spilling onto the pavements add to the lively atmosphere,"" he said.
""The fact that the pub is independently owned - and as I've heard with a rather well-known DJ involved - rather than tied to a brewery, gives it fantastic flexibility and a unique charm for its visitors.
""It's definitely one of my go-to spots when I'm out in town for a pint.""",UK

Amen, who is originally from Eritrea, lived with his father in Glasgow and had recently been granted 'right to remain' status in the UK.
He attended St Thomas Aquinas secondary school in Jordanhill.
His headteacher there described him as friendly and much-loved young man who was interested in music and the media.

It comes after the company's vessel Manxman became grounded on a mud bank in the harbour earlier this month on its return to Douglas from Heysham.
Since then a number of dredging operations have taken place in the harbour to flatten the bottom of the main basin.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said rescheduling would continue ""operational water depths"" were achieved by the removal of ""accumulated material"".

BBC News, South East","Local authorities in the South East will have to publish annual reports on pothole repairs, or risk seeing their funding reduced.
The new policy is being introduced prior to councils receiving £79m funding from the Department for Transport (DfT).
The government has warned that if a council fails to publish its figures, it will lose 25% of the funding.
Figures from the RAC reveal drivers encounter an average of six potholes per mile in England and Wales, and pothole damage to cars costs an average £600 to fix.
Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: ""The public deserves to know how their councils are improving their local roads, which is why they will have to show progress or risk losing funding.""
The government has announced funding of £1.6bn nationally for road repairs, and an extra £4.8bn for National Highways to deliver critical road schemes and maintain motorways and major A-roads.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynlnn9w78o,Parents share thoughts on 'sobering' Netflix show,2025-03-23T12:01:23.419Z,,"Parents in the Channel Islands have expressed a need to ""come together"" after watching the four-part Netflix series Adolescence.
Vicky O'Neil, from Jersey, has a 10-year-old son and said she found the show ""sobering"".
Adolescence follows the family of a 13-year-old boy arrested for killing a female classmate and tackles themes of bullying, incel (involuntary celibacy) culture, and navigating social media as a young person.
Ms O'Neil said the show ""reiterates this safeguarding crisis that we're having"".
She said: ""It's quite easy I think sometimes to say 'oh just don't give your child the phone', but I know from experience that our very restrictive approach to technology resulted in social exclusion for one of our children.""
She added she wanted to start talking about it and to try and do something as a community.
Ms O'Neil said: ""We're seeing how deeply entrenched misogyny...is becoming with our boys and I think we should be really, really alarmed by this.
""I'd just love us to start talking about it, accept there's no easy answer and try and do something"".
She said schools should support parents who did not want their kids to have smart phones at an early age.
Adolescence – which stars Graham as dad Eddie and Owen Cooper as Jamie – was the most-watched show on Netflix around the world in the days after its release last week.
Sally Rochester, from Guernsey, who has children aged 14 and 16 said she found the final episode of the show ""harrowing"".
She said: ""As parents we find ourselves wanting to protect our children but letting these devices into their lives for various understandable reasons puts them at some extraordinary risk.""
Constable Richard Vibert, minister for children and families in Jersey, was questioned about online safety in a States Assembly meeting in February.
He directed people to the Government of Jersey website, which he said featured practical advice and guidance for parents, including how to talk to children about online risks; parental controls, and screen time.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrdnkyvpjgo,Why are there no native squirrels in Guernsey?,2025-03-23T11:48:48.411Z,"Jack Silver
BBC News, Guernsey","A grey squirrel made headlines when it arrived as a stowaway on a ferry to Guernsey - an island which has neither grey or red squirrels.
But why does the Channel Island have no native red squirrels - and why does it lack other small species like moles, badgers and foxes, as well as snakes and toads?
Dr Ellie Scopes, a population modeller for Forest Research, says Guernsey became an island towards the end of the last ice age before many small animals reached it.
""That's definitely what happened with Ireland,"" Dr Scopes said. ""It got cut off much earlier than Britain did so has a completely different assemblage of animals.""
She said some small species such as moles ""could have made it over"" in the past, but become extinct later.
Because Guernsey is a small island, once they went extinct locally they would not be able to re-establish themselves, she said.
Dr Scopes was part of a team that discovered the largest example of a subspecies of giant vole on Guernsey in 2018.
She said another possible reason Guernsey did not establish a population of red squirrels, which are native to Britain and France, is because they ""like tree cover"" and Guernsey does not have larger areas of woodland.
However other species such as field voles and common shrews could thrive on Guernsey if they became established.
Dr Scopes said a single animal, even a pregnant female, was ""highly unlikely"" to be able to establish a viable population because of inbreeding.
""You need quite a few to start a population,"" she said, potentially as many as 20 to 40 individuals.
""Very interestingly, Ireland has had a population of greater white-tooth shrews introduced recently,"" Dr Scopes said, adding that they are suspected to have come into the country hidden in some hay.
Guernsey and the other Channel Islands were originally joined to mainland France but broke away towards the end of the ice age, according to Guernsey Museums.
Guernsey and Alderney were separated from the French mainland about 11,200 years ago, a spokesperson said.
Herm and Sark became separate from Guernsey 2,500 to 3,000 years later.
Jersey separated from the mainland much later, around 6,000 years ago according to the island's government.
Unlike Guernsey, Jersey has a native species of toad as well as red squirrels, which were introduced to the island in the late 1800s, Jersey's government said.
Grey squirrels are native to North America and classed as an invasive species in the UK because of the threat they pose to native red squirrels.
They were first brought to the UK by the Victorians as an ""ornamental species"" in gardens of stately homes.
They can out-compete smaller reds for food and habitat, and some also carry a virus fatal to the native species.
Releasing greys in the UK was banned in 1930, but they have spread across England, Wales and large parts of Scotland.

BBC News","Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered an urgent investigation into the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday.
The investigation, led by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), would build a ""clear picture"" of the incident and UK's energy resilience more broadly to prevent it ""from ever happening again"", the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said.
""We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned,"" Miliband said.
The fire at the North Hyde substation in west London that supplies power to the airport led to thousands of cancelled flights on Friday and stranded passengers across the world.
On Sunday Heathrow said it would be operating ""another full schedule"" with more than 1,300 flights after more than 250,000 passengers passed through the airport on Saturday.
""We have welcomed the Government's announcement of an investigation into the cause and response to the off-airport power outage and have launched a review, to be chaired by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly, of Heathrow's response,"" a statement from the airport added.
More than 63,000 homes lost power in the outage caused by the fire, according to energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. About 150 people were evacuated from surrounding properties.
The Met Police has said that counter-terrorism officers were ""leading inquiries"" but are not treating the incident as suspicious.
Miliband said he has commissioned the investigation to ""understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future"".
NESO, which operates Britain's electricity grid, is expected to report to the power regulator Ofgem and the government in six weeks with its initial findings.
Nearly 1,400 flights were disrupted by the airport's closure, according to air traffic website flightradar24.com. Around 120 flights were diverted elsewhere.
Separately, Heathrow has announced a review of the airport's response to the power outage and its crisis management plans will be undertaken by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly.
The airport said it was ""open and fully operational"" on Saturday morning, but the chaos has raised questions about the resilience of the major transport hub.
Fifty slots were added to Saturday's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through it, the airport said.
On Saturday, more than 30 flights due to depart from the airport were cancelled and more than 15 were delayed, according to Heathrow's live departure board.
It also showed that more than 70 flights expected to arrive at the airport had been cancelled, including from Doha, Riyadh, Dubai, Manchester, and Newcastle Upon Tyne.
Farah Rafeeq was due to travel with a friend from Heathrow to Cambodia on Friday to attend a friend's wedding but the mass cancellation of flights has meant she will miss part of the ceremony.
The 24-year-old found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon in time for the wedding reception but said they had to pay ""double the amount"" for a the new flight.
In Miami, Charlotte and her family were heading to Heathrow on Thursday night when their American Airlines plane was ""turned around mid-flight"", she said.
""I have been stranded in Miami with my infant one year-old and three year-old son since then,"" she told the BBC.
She said the family had been ""passed around from hotel to hotel"", but now hopes to be booked on a flight on Sunday.
An American Airlines spokesperson said it has been ""working around the clock to get customers on their way"" to Heathrow ""as quickly and efficiently as possible"", adding that it was providing overnight accommodation to passengers affected by the airport's closure.
Substations, operated by National Grid, are designed to produce, convert, and distribute electricity at suitable voltage levels. Heathrow uses three electricity substations, each with a backup.
There are also backup diesel generators, and uninterruptible battery-powered supplies which provide enough power to keep safety critical systems such as aircraft landing systems running.
However, when the fire broke out the substation, it was out of action, along with its backup.
Heathrow's main fall-back was the two remaining substations, but the airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, told the BBC that it ""takes time"" to ""switch them"".
He said the incident was ""not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences"".
In a statement released on Saturday evening, Mr Woldbye welcomed the investigation, saying that ""we will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident"".
Heathrow's chairman Lord Paul Deighton said the airport regrets the disruption caused and hopes people affected ""understand that the decision was made in order to prioritise the safety of our passengers and colleagues"".
He added that the airport is ""committed to finding any potential learnings from this unprecedented incident"" when its review is conducted.

Heathrow said that it will ""restart"" some flights later on Friday, and said it hoped ""to run a full operation"" on Saturday. The airport warned passengers not to travel to the airport unless their airline has advised them to.
Passengers who were on flights already in the air have told the BBC of the disruption that ensued after they were diverted or turned back to where they had departed from.

Steve, a businessman, had been on the final stretch of a 14-hour flight from Singapore to London when the speaker system crackled to life.
""The captain came on saying 'While you've been sleeping there have been some developments'"", he said.
Their destination - Heathrow Airport - was closed, the captain told passengers, saying that they were diverting to France.
Steve found himself in Paris on Friday morning searching the Eurostar site to get a train back across the Channel.
Meanwhile, 3,000 miles (5,000km) away, Danielle from Shropshire said she and her parents were left to fend for themselves at JFK Airport after their British Airways (BA) flight was cancelled.
Passengers had boarded the plane on Thursday, she said, but were left waiting on the tarmac for several hours before being told the flight was cancelled.
She was calling from the cold, hard floor of the terminal on Friday morning, where they had been camped for several hours.
""No new flights have been found, no accommodation has been offered or is even available to book.""
""We have been issued a $9 (£6.95) food voucher, which will be interesting when a bottle of Evian water here costs $6 (£4.64),"" she said.
A BA spokesperson said it had to cancel all short-haul flights in and out of the airport on Friday and was reviewing its long-haul schedule ""as well as the implications for our schedule for tomorrow and beyond"".
""We will update our customers as soon as possible and we continue to ask them not to travel to Heathrow Airport, but to check on ba.com for the latest flight information.""
Affected passengers will be contacted with options including rebooking their flight or receiving a full refund, the airline said.
Some stranded passengers worried that it could take far longer than just the weekend to get home.
British serviceman William Hastings, 31, was camping out in New York's JFK's terminal four after his flight with Delta was cancelled.
He and two of his colleagues were on their way home after a six-month military attachment in the US.
William said that after he saw the tweet from Heathrow Airport saying it was closed, more than an hour went by before any confirmation came from Delta.
""Suddenly you've got 500 people rushing [to the bookings desk] to get to these three Delta agents to try and rebook flights,"" he said.
""Tired. Frustrated. Angry,"" is how he summed it up.
He said he had queued for four hours to secure a replacement flight and a hotel organised by the airline - 30 miles from the airport.
The return flight is not until Sunday afternoon and will go via Germany.
""And that depends on whether Heathrow is even operational or not,"" William added.
A Delta spokesperson said it had suspended operations to Heathrow ""and provided customers additional flexibility in rebooking their travel"".
Others still do not know when they will return to the UK.
Just reaching Miami International Airport after a two-week holiday had been an ordeal for Holly Lloyd's family, as their route took them past raging bush fires.
""The road opened with flames at the side of the road as we drove through and was closing behind us,"" said Ms Lloyd from Cambridgeshire, who was travelling with her four-year-old daughter, elderly parents and husband.
After making the flight with seconds the spare, they boarded the plane and sat on the tarmac for nearly three hours before being told the flight had been cancelled, Ms Lloyd said.
Virgin Atlantic offered ""no help,"" she added, ""just a letter basically telling us to sort ourselves out and they should refund"".
The family found a hotel room at 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT).
But they still have no idea when they will get a flight home.
A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said Heathrow's closure had a ""significant impact"" on its flights on Friday, but that it expected to operate ""a near full schedule"" on Saturday.

BBC News","There are no plans for a Royal visit during Jersey's Liberation Day events, the Bailiff has said.
Princess Anne will join the celebrations on Guernsey.
The German ambassador to the UK, His Excellency Mr Miguel Berger, and other members of the diplomatic community are joining the commemoration in Jersey, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the occupation.
The Bailiff of Jersey, Sir Timothy Le Cocq, said it was ""very important"" to share Jersey's culture and heritage with others.
Mr Le Cocq said it was important ""in these times of global uncertainty"" that the German Ambassador took part in the commemoration.
He added welcoming diplomats to join the celebrations was ""a way of Jersey celebrating its place in the international community, a way of looking outward as well as inward"".
Mr Le Cocq said he wanted to ensure the island's senior citizens who experienced wartime Britain, and young people ""who will carry on the memories and maintain the importance of our freedom"", enjoyed the Liberation Day and the events surrounding 9 May.
The Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied during World War Two, with about 15,000 troops stationed on Jersey at one time.
The Germans brought in thousands of slave labourers and deported 1,200 people to internment camps, according to the Government of Jersey website.

BBC News Investigations","South American drug gangs are dropping cocaine in the sea around the UK to be picked up by smaller boats and brought to shore, Border Force has warned.
Tens of millions of pounds worth of drugs are being wrapped in flotation devices equipped with trackers, allowing gang members in Britain to see where they are, officials say.
This sophisticated method of smuggling large quantities of the drug into the UK has become a ""significant and persistent threat"", they say.
Last week, a court heard that four British men were arrested after picking up a tonne of cocaine, with a street value of £100m, left near the Isles of Scilly in September. They face lengthy prison sentences.
In an effort to intercept the parcels, Border Force has deployed its cutter units, alongside highly trained sniffer dogs.
BBC News got rare access to this unit, including a dog called Flash who sniffed out a cocaine haul hidden among bananas on a ship inbound from South America in January.
The drugs - packed in waterproof parcels and equipped with trackers - were found behind the locked doors of a container on the vessel, which was stopped off the coast of Dover, Kent, and had a street value of more than £50m.
""They were bundled into around 30kg blocks, with life jackets which would then be inflated… and that would be thrown overboard,"" Charlie Eastaugh, maritime director at Border Force, told the BBC.
This tactic known as an ASDO, or at-sea-drop-off, has led to seizures of multiple tonnes of cocaine over recent years, he says.
Drugs are transported on so-called ""mother"" ships by gangs in South America who are in touch with criminals in the UK using satellite phones. When the vessels are in British waters the packages are thrown overboard to be collected by smaller ""daughter"" boats, which locate the contraband.
Mr Eastaugh says the problem is ""significant"" but ""we are able to identify, track, locate, seize and ultimately prosecute and imprison those that are involved"".
Last week, Truro Crown Court heard that last September four men on a boat called the Lily Lola sailed to an area near the Scilly Isles on instructions from a gang in South America.
There, they retrieved a tonne of cocaine dumped by a larger vessel floating in the sea - but before they could bring it back to shore they were intercepted by officers from the NCA.
Jon Williams, 46, the captain of the boat, and Patrick Godfrey, 31, both from Swansea, were hired by Michael Kelly, 45, and Jake Marchant, 27, because of their boat handling skills, the court heard.
They will return to court to be sentenced on 8 May.
There have been a number of other high-profile incidents over the last two years, including:
Prof Adam Winstock, a consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist who spends much of his time working in prisons, says the purity and price of cocaine has ""remained immune to inflation over the last five years"".
As a result, he says ""it doesn't matter to [smugglers] if they lose 20% of shipments"" through seizures by authorities because the mark-up on the drug is so high.
Despite record seizures in 2024, the number of cocaine-linked deaths in the UK is at a 30-year high. There were 1,118 deaths in 2023 - ten times higher than in 2011, according to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics.
Derek Evans from the NCA, who led the investigation into the Lily Lola, warned people working in the fishing community: ""If someone from a crime group approaches you, please let the police know. If you are tempted to go into this line of industry in the criminal framework, think twice"".",UK

BBC News, Isle of Man","People will no longer be able to buy a Manx ferry ticket with cash in a bid to ""deter illicit activity"".
Cash payments have been ""exploited by criminal gangs"" trying to traffic drugs and cash between the Isle of Man and the UK, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) said.
The new rules effect ticket sales in Douglas, Heysham, Liverpool, Belfast, and Dublin.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (IOMSPC) said the move to cashless at ports from 27 March was ""to enhance safety and security"".
The DHA said the police force had been aware of gangs exploiting cash payments for tickets ""for some time"".
However, change will still be accepted on board Manx vessels.
IOMSPC Managing Director Brian Thomson said the move reflected ""the way our customers now prefer to pay and aligns with wider industry trends"".
Going cashless would ""speed up transaction times, enhance security, and provide a more seamless booking experience"", he added.
The company said 1% of its ticket sales were made using cash each year, and the move was a ""practical and progressive step"".
It added that any passengers that did not have access to banking would not be ""penalised"" and it urged people in that position to contact the Steam Packet at least seven days before the travel time to organise ""alternative payment methods"".

Investigations correspondent","One of Stephen Lawrence's murderers now accepts being involved in attacking the black teenager, reports to the Parole Board suggest.
David Norris was jailed for life in 2012 after he had denied being part of the racist attack on 18-year-old Stephen, who was stabbed to death by a gang of young white men in Eltham, south London.
The Parole Board issued a decision on Thursday that Norris's parole hearing should be heard in public.
He became eligible for parole in December after his minimum term expired.
The Parole Board report said: ""Recent reports now suggest he has accepted he was present at the scene and punched the victim but claims that he did not wield the knife. He does not accept he holds racist views.""
The Parole Board confirmed to the BBC that the evidence considered by the public hearing decision-maker was a dossier mostly formed of reports from professionals such as prison and community offender managers.
Norris and Gary Dobson, two of the original five prime suspects in the murder, were convicted under the law of joint enterprise, which allows people to be convicted of murder even if they did not inflict the fatal blow. Stephen was stabbed twice during the attack. It has never been proven who stabbed him, or whether more than one knife was used.
The Met Police has consistently said that six people took part in the attack on Stephen.
Three other prime suspects – Luke Knight, and brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt – have never been convicted of the murder and have always denied it.
A sixth suspect, Matthew White, died in 2021. He was first publicly named as a suspect by the BBC two years ago.
The Met's murder investigation was closed in 2020. Negotiations are currently taking place for an independent review of the case, which was triggered by a series of Met failings exposed by the BBC.
Norris, who was convicted following an Old Bailey trial, has not previously admitted his role in the murder to any official authority or investigation.
Norris gave a ""no comment"" interview when arrested aged 16 in 1993 following the murder. He refused to answer questions at Stephen's inquest in 1997.
In 1998 he appeared at the public inquiry into the murder but could not be asked directly about the attack. The following year he gave a television interview to ITV in which he denied being part of the murder.
Norris opposed his parole hearing being held in public, but the Parole Board ruled against him. Stephen's family wanted the hearing to be heard in public.
Peter Rook KC, Vice Chair of the Parole Board, said he had ""concluded that it is in the interests of justice for there to be a public hearing in this case"". ""The compelling factors in favour of a public hearing outweigh the points raised on Mr Norris' behalf,"" he added.
A hearing date is expected to be fixed later this year.
Were Norris to be released on licence, he could be returned to prison at any time for the rest of life should he breach his licence conditions.",UK

Senior UK Correspondent•@sima_kotecha","When Jane was told by someone she knew that there were nude photos of her on an image-sharing website, she was in complete shock.
Users had left crude and misogynistic comments under the photos. Some were urging the posters to upload more images of her.
""I couldn't believe it,"" Jane told the BBC. ""Men were getting sexual gratification from pictures of me that I hadn't consented to being shared.""
Jane, whose name has been changed for this article, is one of more than a dozen women in the same area of England who had their social media accounts hacked two years ago.
The BBC understands all of them have had intimate images - which were originally sent in private direct messages on social media - posted on the same website.
Some of the women's names have been posted alongside their photos. Two of the women were under 18 when the images were taken, meaning legally, they would also be classed as indecent images of children.
Jane later discovered some of the photos of the other women had also been posted on different sites too.
""It makes me feel very angry that somebody's taking ownership over content that I thought was mine and was sent privately,"" Jane said. ""I feel really exposed... It's disgusting.""
It is a criminal offence to post intimate pictures of someone online without their consent, punishable with up to two years in prison.
Some people colloquially refer to crimes of this nature as ""revenge porn"", even when the perpetrator is not a former partner and there's no revenge motive - but those affected prefer the term ""non-consensual image abuse"".
Jane is now calling on media regulator Ofcom to investigate using its powers under the Online Safety Act.
The law lists 130 ""priority offences"" that companies should focus on preventing, including the non-consensual posting of intimate images.
Earlier this week, Ofcom was given new powers to crack down on illegal content. Tech companies will now have to ensure staff are prioritising taking down the material when alerted to it, and have systems in place that help them do that.
Companies that break the new rules could be fined up to £18m.
Tessa Gregory, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, is representing Jane in her appeal to Ofcom.
She told the BBC that the Revenge Porn Helpline, which supports adults who experience intimate image abuse, helped Jane track down the images by carrying out reverse image searches online and contacting pornographic sites on her behalf.
Ms Gregory said she now wants Ofcom to ""take swift and decisive action"" against the sites.
Ofcom, she said, is supposed to make an announcement online when they begin an investigation.
""We're asking if they're already investigating this issue, because it seems so prevalent we would expect them to be, but we have found no evidence that they are,"" Ms Gregory said.
She added that she and Jane want Ofcom to take action not just against the sites hosting the images, but also against the search engines directing people to those sites.
Ofcom told the BBC it was aware of Jane's case and that it was ""considering any appropriate next steps"".
It added that it had ""a broad range of enforcement powers to hold tech firms accountable"" for carrying out their legal responsibilities under the Online Safety Act, and that it ""won't hesitate to use them where necessary"".
Insiders at Ofcom told the BBC the regulator will prioritise sites based on various things, including reach and the risk they pose to people.
The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which aims to eliminate child sexual abuse images online, launched a campaign last year called Think Before You Share. It educates young people about the potential pitfalls of sharing nude pictures, and how they can be posted elsewhere without their consent.
Emma Hardy, from the IWF, told the BBC that often, by the time they found an image or video, it was ""already out of control"".
""It's already spread further than that trusted partnership, and it's being potentially sold online,"" she said. ""It's being harvested and collated in places where it's being made available for people with a sexual interest in that age or sex of person.""
Jane worries that if action isn't taken quickly, her photos will continue to spread.
""I know somebody has those pictures saved on their computer, so I don't have any control of those images,"" she said. ""I think revenge porn and non-consensual image abuse grows arms and legs. You think they're gone, and then they can be posted in the future.""
But she believes it's unrealistic to expect people not to privately share intimate photos of themselves - and that the onus should be on websites not to host them if they get stolen or leaked.
""I think it's a mistake to think people will never send nudes. Certain websites have a duty to protect your privacy.
""There needs to be a shift in mindset, and not blame the victim for sending the image in the first place. We thought it was private.""
If you, or someone you know, has been affected by intimate image abuse, these organisations may be able to help.

BBC News","A migrant has died after trying to cross the English Channel in an overloaded boat, a day after another person died attempting the journey.
The French coastguard said the person was in a group of 15 they had picked up from a boat carrying about 80, which left Dunkirk on Wednesday night.
French authorities intervened about 03:00 on Thursday after the vessel ran into trouble near Gravelines where it had picked up more migrants.
Three people were pulled from the water and 12 others on board asked to be evacuated, the coastguard said. One person was unconscious and died despite resuscitation efforts.
The others rescued were taken to the port of Gravelines where they were received treatment by onshore emergency services.
The French coastguard said that after the rescue, they had continued to monitor the boat's journey towards the UK.
French authorities say numerous departures of migrant boats were reported to its surveillance and rescue centre on Wednesday night.
An investigation has been opened by the Dunkirk public prosecutor's office.
The latest death comes after another migrant died after being pulled from the water on Wednesday.
A rescue operation was launched following reports a group of people had boarded a dinghy and ran into difficulty in the Equihen-Plage area, northern France, shortly after 09:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
Two people were rescued from the water, with one suffering from hypothermia while the other was in cardiac arrest and did not survive.

BBC News","Cancer screenings have been missed and criminal convictions overlooked because of how data is collected about people's biological sex and gender identity, an independent review found.
The review, led by Prof Alice Sullivan, outlined the risks of conflating biological sex and gender when it comes to clinical care, sex-specific cancer screening and safeguarding.
Prof Sullivan, a professor of sociology at University College London, urged public bodies to collect data on both sex and gender identity by default ""across the board"" to ensure it is accurate.
The Department of Health said the findings would be considered with ""the gravity they deserve, as it reforms gender identity services across the board"".
Prof Sullivan said ""a confusion between sex and transgender and gender diverse identities"" had developed in recent years and there had been attempts to ""merge these two things into one variable"".
While people can legally change gender, they can't change biological sex. This means a woman who transitions to become a man may still need cervical smears and transgender women may need prostate checks.
Prof Sullivan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there is no reason for a ""trade off"" between recording data on sex and gender.
""What I've argued in this report is that sex is really important, we should be recording it by default - transgender and gender diverse identities can also be recorded where that's appropriate,"" she said.
""There's no reason to see this as a trade-off between the two. They're two distinct variables.""
The report, commissioned by the previous Conservative government in February of last year, also raised concerns about policing as suspects do not have to tell officers that they have changed their name or gender.
It is possible someone could be released from custody before their offending history is known about, the review said.
The report recommends that police forces record data on sex in their systems and stop allowing changes to be made to individual sex markers on the police national computer.
It also said new NHS numbers and changed gender markers should no longer be issued.
She urged the government to implement the recommendations ""across the board"".
""I've recommended that data on sex should be collected by default in all research and data collection commissioned by government and quasi-governmental organisations, and I think implementing that would make a huge difference,"" she said.
""I think we need leadership, because people are confused and they're anxious.""
A government spokesperson said: ""This government is clear that the collection of accurate and relevant data is vital in research and the operation of effective public services, particularly when it comes to sex.""
The review has been shared with the Office for National Statistics and other departments, the spokesperson added.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson said civil servants were taking action to make sure the right guidance is in place.
""There's obviously circumstances for recognising people's gender, but the importance of biological sex, when it comes to, for example, healthcare, is common sense,"" he added.",UK

BBC News, Yorkshire","A plaque honouring the world's first black international footballer has been unveiled at his former school in Halifax.
Andrew Watson captained Scotland to a 6-1 win over England on his debut in 1881.
He had attended Crossley Heath School, on Skircoat Moor, before moving to Glasgow aged 18.
Unveiling the plaque on Wednesday, England's first black international Viv Anderson said he had nothing but ""admiration"" for Watson.
Watson was a ""pioneer"" and the first black footballer to play internationally for Scotland, but for more than a century the significance of his achievements went ""unrecognised"", according to BBC Sport.
He was born in Guyana in 1856 to a black woman who had been born into slavery and a white Scottish solicitor.
Watson's family, though, were wealthy and among his ancestors was John Gladstone, one of the largest slave owners in the West Indies and the father of British Prime Minister William Gladstone.
Mr Anderson said: ""He must have been very strong-willed, back in the 1800s it must have been quite difficult for him.
""And he got through it and did very well. I've got nothing but admiration for him.""
Watson moved to Britain aged about two and was educated at some of the ""finest schools in England"", according to BBC Sport.
Llew Walker, who wrote a book about Watson, said he had played rugby at school in Halifax before moving to Scotland to go to university.
""At that time Scotland were constantly beating England at football,"" the author said.
""They had developed a whole new style of football.
""Watson learned that, came to England and merged what made Scotland great - and from that the modern game was born.""
It was in Scotland that he would become a leading player and respected talent.
Watson three times won the Scottish FA Cup and played three times internationally for Scotland winning on each occasion.
After a second victory, winning 5-1 at the original Hampden Park, the English Football Association was convinced of a need to change its approach to the game.
Watson moved back to England and was recruited to play for leading amateur team Corinthians, based in London.
He later played for FC Bootle before retiring from the sport.
Watson died in 1921, aged 64.
At the plaque unveiling in Halifax, Dean Jones, head teacher at the school, said pupils had been able to connect to Watson's story.
""We are a really diverse school, so being able to champion your own heritage, to have a positive influence, to be excellent, students can relate to that.
""And to have a sporting icon associated with the school makes us all really proud.""

BBC News","The UK is hosting a closed meeting on Thursday of senior military leaders from the ""coalition of the willing"", as they draw up plans for a proposed peacekeeping force for Ukraine.
More than 20 countries are thought to be involved.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to attend on Thursday afternoon after first visiting Barrow, where he is due to lay the keel of one of Britain's next generation of nuclear-armed submarines.
Plans for a Western-led peacekeeping force for Ukraine are said to be moving to an operational phase.
Senior military officers from nations that make up the ""coalition of the willing"", led by Britain and France, are due to discuss how this would work in practice when they gather at the UK's Permanent Joint Headquarters in Northwood.
Armed Forces minister Luke Pollard said they want the coalition to be a ""credible force"" that would allow Ukraine to ""enjoy a lasting peace"" and ""reconstitute and rearm"".
""[Vladimir] Putin won't stop if he wins in Ukraine. If he subjugates the entirety of Ukraine – which is his plan and has been for many years – he will simply rearm and look where else he can extend his influence and his domination,"" he told BBC Breakfast.
""That is not in our interest as a country, certainly not in the interest of our European friends.""
Pollard said securing peace in Ukraine may mean ""some boots on the ground"", but the force will also ""have a strong feature of air and maritime forces"".
But there remain some major obstacles.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will not tolerate the presence of any Nato member troops in Ukraine, regardless of their role.
The US is also proving reluctant to provide the necessary air cover that prospective members say they need.
Sir Keir is expected to attend part of the meeting after first visiting Barrow where he will lay the keel of HMS Dreadnought, one of the next generation of nuclear-armed submarines.
On his visit to the town, Sir Keir will say Barrow is a ""blueprint"" for how defence spending can benefit a community.
He is due to announce that the King has agreed to grant Barrow the title of ""Royal"" in recognition of its contribution to national security.
Earlier he visited the crew of one of Britain's nuclear submarines, HMS Vanguard, as it returned to Scotland after patrolling the waters of the north Atlantic.
The prime minister told reporters the Kremlin respected the UK's nuclear arsenal because ""we've got our own independent deterrent and we're committed to Nato"".
""What is obviously important is they appreciate that it is what it is which is a credible capability,"" he said. ""And that it most certainly is.""
Defence Secretary John Healey, who joined the prime minister on the visit, stressed the government's ""unshakeable"" commitment to the UK's nuclear deterrent, which he called ""the ultimate guarantor of our national security and the security of our Nato allies"".

BBC News","Royal Mail has unveiled a set of stamps featuring mythical creatures and fabled figures from UK folklore.
Designed by London-based artist Adam Simpson, the illustrations include the Loch Ness Monster, Cornish piskies, and Beowulf and Grendel.
The set of eight stamps and the stories each represents from different regions across the UK ""demonstrate our rich mythological heritage"", Simpson said.
They are available to pre-order from Thursday and go on sale on 27 March.
Other stamps in the Myths and Legends collection depict Blodeuwedd of Welsh mythology, Irish heroic figure Fionn mac Cumhaill, the spectral hound of East Anglia, Black Shuck, selkies and a grindylow.
Grindylows are sprites with long arms that lurk in rivers and ponds ready to snatch curious children in folklore from Lancashire and Yorkshire, while selkies are fabled creatures from Orkney and Shetland which shed their seal skins to take human form.
Simpson, whose previous work has been shortlisted for a British Design Award, said creating the stamps was a ""privilege"" and he was ""really happy"" to receive the commission.
""I think it's important to celebrate where these stories come from,"" he said. ""Each one is associated with a region, and each one has its own identity, and together they demonstrate our rich mythological heritage.""
Simpson previously designed a Royal Mail stamp to celebrate the Triathlon at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Illustrating stamps is challenging, he said, because ""the composition needs to work at such a small scale"".
To portray the fight between Beowulf and the monster Grendel, from the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, he had to ""figure out how to have two figures in a space that works on a small scale"" and ""wanted to suggest that Beowulf defeats Grendel by tearing off his arm without the image becoming disturbing"".
Simpson said the project became a ""real labour of love"" and took more than a year to complete, with the illustrations evolving over time.
""It gave me the chance to be fully immersed in the world of these myths and legends. I hope that the stamps either start conversations or invite people to investigate the stories if they're not familiar with them.""
David Gold, director of external affairs and policy at Royal Mail, said: ""For some parts of the UK, local myths and legends are as much a part of their identity as the local landmarks and architecture.
""These beautifully illustrated stamps celebrate a fascinating aspect of British culture and custom.""
The Royal Mail's Special Stamp programme commemorates anniversaries and aspects of UK history and culture, with the first commemorative stamp issued in 1924 to mark the opening of the British Empire Exhibition.

BBC News","Sir Gareth Southgate says he fears young men are spending too much time gaming, gambling and watching pornography - and they need better role models beyond online influencers.
In a wide-ranging talk for the BBC's annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture, the ex-England men's football manager spoke about his own experience of missing a crucial penalty at Euro 96, saying he didn't let it define him.
""That pain still haunts me today,"" he said, ""and I guess it always will.""
Referencing his own experiences, he said the UK needed to do more to encourage young people - especially young men - to make the right choices in life and to not fear failure.
Rather than turning to teachers, sports coaches or youth group leaders, Sir Gareth said he feared many young men were searching for direction online. There, he said they were finding a new kind of role model, one that too often did not have their best interests at heart.
""These are callous, manipulative and toxic influencers, whose sole drive is for their own gain,"" he said.
""They willingly trick young men into believing that success is measured by money or dominance, that strength means never showing emotion, and that the world, including women, is against them.""
Sir Gareth spoke about missing the crucial penalty in the 1996 Euros semi-final, when England lost to Germany.
""Missing that penalty was undoubtedly a watershed moment that made me stronger, a better man,"" Sir Gareth said at the lecture. ""It forced me to dig deep, and revealed an inner belief and resilience I never knew existed.""
He contrasted his own miss with Eric Dier's successful penalty kick against Colombia in 2018, when - with Sir Gareth as manager - England won a World Cup penalty shootout for the first time.
During the intervening 22 years, he said there had been a change in mindset among England players.
""In 1996, I had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing I would miss,"" he said. ""In 2018, Eric had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing he would score.""
During Sir Gareth's career as a defender and midfielder, he played for Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough and was in the England squad between 1995 and 2004. He took over as manager in 2016 and led the team to the 2018 World Cup semi-final, 2022 World Cup quarter-final and Euro finals in 2020 and 2024.
He stepped down as manager in July, two days after England lost to Spain in the Euros.
Sir Gareth has been credited with revitalising the England team and was knighted in the King's New Year Honours in December.
He is the latest in a line of academics, business leaders and other notable figures to deliver the Richard Dimbleby Lecture, which has been held most years since 1972 in memory of the broadcaster.
Previous speakers have included King Charles III, when he was the Prince of Wales, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates, and Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Sir Gareth's talk focused on the importance of belief and resilience for young men, and he cited three things needed to build these: identity, connection and culture.
He referred to a report, released earlier this month by the Centre for Social Justice, which said boys and young men were ""in crisis"", with a ""staggering"" increase in those not in education, employment or training.
""Too many young men are isolated,"" Sir Gareth said in his talk. ""Too many feel uncomfortable opening up to friends or family. Many don't have mentors - teachers, coaches, bosses - who understand how best to push them to grow. And so, when they struggle, young men inevitably try to handle whatever situation they find themselves in, alone.""
""Young men end up withdrawing, reluctant to talk or express their emotions,"" he added. ""They spend more time online searching for direction and are falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming, gambling and pornography.""
Ukie - the UK's trade body for video games - said it was ""disappointed"" by the way the former England manager characterised gaming.
In a letter to Sir Gareth it said: ""Video games should be celebrated for their positive impact, as a medium that connects people, teaches new skills, drives creativity, and boosts the economy.""
Sir Gareth also said young men don't get enough opportunities to fail and learn from their mistakes.
""In my opinion, if we make life too easy for young boys now, we will inevitably make life harder when they grow up to be young men,"" he said. ""Too many young men are at risk of fearing failure, precisely because they've had so few opportunities to experience and overcome it. They fail to try, rather than try and fail.""
The ex-footballer also reflected on what his career has taught him about belief and resilience.
""If I've learned anything from my life in football, it's that success is much more than the final score,"" he said. ""True success is how you respond in the hardest moments.""
The Richard Dimbleby Lecture with Sir Gareth Southgate is broadcast at 10.40pm on BBC One and available on iPlayer now
The Beautiful Game: Building Belief and Resilience in a Younger Generation
Good evening.
Tonight, I want to talk about two very different penalty kicks, separated by more than two decades, but connected by two characteristics far more powerful than football.
These characteristics have picked me up when I've been down, grounded me in success, and given me purpose amidst the noise of public life.
They are qualities that everyone, young and old, needs every day of their lives.
They are belief and resilience.
Now, I'd like you to picture the old Wembley Stadium, it's England versus Germany, semi-final of Euro 96 a tournament that has captivated the nation, up to this point, extra- time has finished and we're locked at 1-1.
And my childhood hero Bryan Robson has asked me would I take penalty number 6 if it goes to sudden death. Now I've been captain of every team that I played for and this is my hero asking the question…
So, you just don't say no at those moments.
But… I am thinking as I'm walking away… Mmm, let's hope it doesn't go to that…
1-0, 1-1
I'm not a regular penalty taker, with a process to fall back on...
2-1, 2-2
But never mind because Dave Seaman saved one last weekend so we'll be ok...
3-2 and actually Dave this would be a really good moment to save one...
3-3
What happens if I miss? My brain has now entered the arena of what might go wrong and now I'm in trouble...
4-4, 5-5
In front of 90,000 people and millions watching at home.
Let me tell you that 30-yard walk from the centre circle to the penalty spot feels like you've walked from Land's End to John o' Groats, and that's basically how my legs felt when I got there as well. It was as much as I could do to hit the target, forget placement or power… the keeper duly saves. And we're out...
I feel I've let myself down, my teammates down, my country down.
That pain still haunts me today and I guess it always will.
Now, that single shot could have defined my life, let alone my football career. It didn't. But how I chose to respond to it did.
And that's what I want to talk about tonight.
How do you build resilience when the going gets tough?
How do you cultivate belief, in individuals, AND in a collective?
And how do you build a positive culture not just for a national football team, but for a nation?
Before I delve into this topic, I want to personally thank the Dimbleby family, and the BBC, for this enormous honour and wonderful opportunity to deliver the 2025 Richard Dimbleby Lecture.
Since 1972, the Lecture has been delivered by 45 speakers, including princes, scientists, influential business and religious leaders, as well as other prominent figures.
So adding the former England football manager to the illustrious list is certainly a bold selection… Now… there's a slight question mark hanging over my head about bold selections... so I really hope this one works for you!
Richard Dimbleby was not just a broadcaster, but an extraordinary man of belief and resilience. The exact themes I want to explore. So, it really is an honour to be standing here today.
Every generation faces its own challenges, and today's young generation is no different. Life is never easy, setbacks are almost always part of the journey.
I discovered this myself fairly early on. I'd always dreamed of being a professional footballer.
At 13 years old I'd been asked to train with Southampton at their Centre of Excellence in Crawley. And I loved it. But, much to my dismay, after two enjoyable years, I received a letter to say I was being released.
Now, I'm not saying I was bitter, but I've still got the letter. So let me read some of it to you, whether you want to hear it or not.
Dear, I should add ""Dear"" is typed, Gareth Southgate, which is handwritten, you get the feel of the personal nature of this. On behalf of Southampton Football Club, I'm writing to inform you that we will not be offering your son… a place on our centre of excellence. Let's leave that there.
It was the first time in my football career that my belief and resilience was tested. Fortunately I'm driven and I don't give up… and eventually I got a second chance when Crystal Palace offered me an apprenticeship at 16. I have to say I really struggled adapting to football being a job, rather than something I did with my mates at the weekend; struggled with the physical demands of playing against men for the first time.
In fact after two months my youth coach, Alan Smith, hauled me into his office and said: Look, you're a lovely fella, good manners… If you were my son I'd be really proud, but actually you're weak... and as a footballer you've got absolutely no chance. Now there was no written evidence this time, so I've made Alan sit in the front row of the audience and he can answer of himself at the end of the evening.
It actually took me five years to break into Palace's first team, most of my mates got released in that time. Let me tell you, its unbelievably hard to make it as a professional footballer.
While I faced tough times during the early part of my career, I believe the world for young men and women they are growing up in today is increasingly difficult.
Not because they are born weaker, or without the resilience of past generations, but because the pressures they face today are unique.
And at the heart of this is the unrelenting impact of social media.
Today, young people are bombarded by information at all times of the day, from a device that fits neatly into the palm of their hand, and updates by the second.
They are targeted with images of the perfect body, the perfect career and the perfect life. A beautifully crafted highlights reel where success appears to be instant and effortless.
How can this make them feel good about themselves?
When I was growing up, the only people I had to compare myself to were the other kids on my street, in my school or my football team. I was a bit of an idiot, there were some idiots over there, I knew roughly where I stood in the pecking order really, realised nobody was perfect.
But now you can find yourself mocked, bullied or ridiculed if it appears that you don't conform to whatever is deemed to be the latest trend of the day and believe me I should know.
As hardened as I am to opinions and criticisms, there's no way I was going to trawl through social media last summer and read a load of abuse. It wouldn't have helped me in any way to do my job and so I had to shut myself off from it as far as I could.
And it seems that young people themselves actually recognise this problem.
A recent poll of 16 to 24 year olds from the National Education Union found that the majority believe social media has become more toxic and addictive in the past five years, negatively impacting their mental health, sleep, attention span, and ability to work or study.
I'm actually sure this comes as no surprise to any parent who asks their child on a daily basis to put their phones away.
The solutions are complex because bad habits have been formed. But ignoring the negative impact of social media on our young people is not an option.
In recent months, my curiosity about the landscape for our young people has led me to visit community centres, schools and even a prison, and I've had a lot of fascinating meetings with academics, teachers, youth workers, and coaches.
And in all those interactions, there's one topic that keeps being brought to my attention. And it's parents who keep raising it.
Young men are suffering. They are feeling isolated. They're grappling with their masculinity and with their broader place in society.
This issue was highlighted recently when the Centre for Social Justice published a report entitled Lost Boys, focused on the ""crisis"" - to use their word - facing boys and young men.
It found that across most metrics of importance within society - education, employment, health, and others - young men are falling behind.
And how sad is this, suicide remains the leading cause of death for men aged under 50 in the UK. That is heartbreaking.
Now, I would at this moment just like to say that I care deeply and equally about the plight of young women. By focusing my remarks on young men, I don't, for a second, intend to underplay their challenges, not least around self-esteem and mental health, especially today. I've worked with some amazing women, I have a beautiful daughter and wife, I care deeply about them all.
But given my background, and having developed young men throughout my career, I feel more qualified to talk about the challenges they face.
And as one mother told me recently: ""One of the most impactful things we can do for women is to focus on improving young men.""
So why is this happening? Why do so many young men feel lost, isolated, or without hope?
From an early age young boys need to fail often and learn fast. Falling off a bike, splitting up with friends, messing up exams and maybe even… missing a penalty. These are the moments that test belief and build resilience.
It's a paradox that all parents face. And as a parent myself, I get it. Do we protect them from failure - out of love and support, or expose them to risks that may challenge their resolve?
In my opinion, if we make life too easy for young boys now… we will… inevitably... make life harder when they grow up to be young men
Ironically, parents know exactly what their children are doing in the physical world, but they are losing control in the virtual world …. where young people are exposed to far more danger
...and failure is something that is shared with the world.
The result is that too many young men are at risk of fearing failure, precisely because they've had so few opportunities to experience and overcome it.
They fail to try… rather than try and fail.
What seems to have changed is a sense of traditional family and community role models.
The Centre for Social Justice report highlights how 2.5 million children in the UK have no father figure at home.
This is, as they describe it, ""an epidemic of fatherlessness,"" noting that boys are more likely now to own a smartphone than to live with their dad.
Now all the experts I've listened to over the last 20 years speak about the importance of male role models in a boys life.
That actually doesn't have to be just at home. There's a point at which boys look naturally for mentors outside their immediate family, and is often where they find the role models who inspire them the most.
I've always believed ""You don't need to be a Dad to be a father figure.""
However boys are spending less time at youth centres, sports facilities and community events. They aren't meeting the traditional role models I used to meet such as coaches, youth workers and teachers.
Which leads neatly to my third observation
As real-world communities and mentorship declines, young men end up withdrawing, reluctant to talk or express their emotions
They spend more time online searching for direction and are falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming, gambling and pornography.
And this void is filled by a new kind of role model who do not have their best interest at heart.
These are callous, manipulative and toxic influencers, whose sole drive is for their own gain.
They willingly trick young men into believing that success is measured by money or dominance, never showing emotion, and that the world... including women... is against them.
They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives.
So if young men are falling behind, if they don't believe in themselves, and if they are becoming less resilient, what can WE do? What can WE change? How can WE reverse this decline?
Because qualities like belief and resilience aren't something you're simply born with.
They don't appear overnight. They are built - step by step, experience by experience, through grit and determination.
From my professional experiences, I've learnt that belief and resilience sit on three key foundations: Identity, Connection, and Culture - and that these elements are as important to wider society as they were to the England football team.
Let's start with identity…
One of the first questions every young man should ask themselves is: Who am I?
For some this question is shaped by their family history.
A big part of who I am is down to my Grandad's military service and the values of duty and respect that he and my parents instilled in me.
Race, obviously plays a major role.
Many young men in Britain today have dual heritage. They are balancing British Nationality with family roots in Africa, the Caribbean, Asia or Europe.
It's such an important part of our country.
Regional location, opportunity and class all contribute significantly as well.
The England squads I managed were made up of players from all these backgrounds. Everyone had their own story, their own values and their own identity.
But when I became England Manager, no one had the answer to the question ""who are we?""
What was our shared identity, the DNA of the team, that everyone understood, and were proud to be a part of?
In response we deliberately set out to define it.
We shared personal stories... we talked about our country... the football legends who came before us... and our place in history.
By the end we knew who we were.
A proud, diverse, resilient team that stood up for each other... and was ready to write our own chapter in English football history.
It meant that when we anticipated racist abuse ahead of games, the players had the power… and support… to decide their response if it happened.
They chose not to be intimidated… but to stand up… play on… and win regardless.
Similarly… moral decisions… about whether to take the knee before games as a way of protesting against racism or discrimination, became unanimous and obvious ones to take.
Players had a positive impact on society and inspired youngsters up and down the country.
And that is the power of identity.
Young men in our society face the same questions of ""who am I?"" and ""who are we?"".
And just like our players, owning your story... and understanding that you are part of a bigger narrative that existed before you... and will continue long after you're gone.
That's the first step to building belief and resilience.
But being secure in your own identity isn't enough. You need to authentically connect with those around you. You need to feel the sum is greater than the part.
That is because human beings are social creatures; we form relationships because they are essential to our wellbeing and survival.
No matter how talented you are as an individual, success is impossible without the right people around you
When I arrived as England Manager, there was a disconnect between the team, the media, AND the fans.
It was clear to me that strengthening those connections between these three core audiences was critical if we wanted to improve the fortunes of the team.
It's well documented that we decided to be more open and honest with the media, using social media in a positive way to offer an insight into the genuine camaraderie that existed.
This gave a more emotive, trusted connection between the players and the fans - and it also gave us some memorable images of inflatable unicorns.
But the most important and strongest connections were within the team.
I wanted to really get to know my players, and I spent a lot of time talking to each of them about their lives, their hopes, and their fears.
They were happy to talk to me and they were happy to talk to each other.
Players looked forward to meeting up. We had fun. We laughed together and at times even these strong powerful men, opened up to me about their feelings…and cried on my shoulder.
And that's fine by the way… and I think it's an important message for young men today.
It was these connections and relationships that created the belief and resilience that carried us beyond where we might have gone when times got really tough. We weren't just playing for the badge, we were playing for each other.
Now, growing up in a digital age, it can be easy to think that young men are more connected than ever before.
But I actually believe the opposite is true.
Real connection - the kind that gives you belief and resilience - is becoming harder, not easier, to find. You can have millions of followers online, and not one person to turn to when you really need help. The result is that too many young men are isolated. Too many feel uncomfortable opening up to family or friends.
Many don't have mentors - teachers, coaches, bosses - who understand how to push them to grow.
And so, when they struggle, young men inevitably try to handle whatever situation they find themselves in, alone.
When I think about my own career, I know I wouldn't be here without the strong relationships I have built and the people who supported me.
My family, who provided a loving, supportive environment from the start of my life, that continues today through my wife and my children.
Or Alan Smith, my youth coach, at Crystal Palace, who wasn't afraid to challenge me - not because he wanted me to fail, but because he wanted me to succeed.
And the exceptional staff I have been privileged to work with; people like Steve Holland, my assistant with England, who was skilled in the areas I wasn't, and who stood firmly alongside me when the pressure was at its most intense.
It meant that whenever I've had setbacks in my career, I've never faced them alone.
And that's made all the difference.
We need to make sure young men today aren't facing their struggles alone either.
That we are there for them, ready to build genuine connections at home, in schools, workplaces and communities.
And it means reminding them that asking for help isn't a weakness - it's a strength.
If identity is about knowing who you are, and connection is about building relationships, then culture is about the environment you exist in.
To my mind, a culture can be defined fairly simply by ""how we do things around here"".
It's made up of hundreds of small behaviours and actions that shape the overall environment.
It started with me.
Because the leader sets the tone for how they want people to behave... and I believe respect is crucial.
Off the pitch, that meant players showing up on time, training hard, being open to learning, and reacting the right way if they weren't selected to start.
On the pitch, I expected them to treat the opposition, and the referee, with respect.
And always give everything for the team
Culture drove some of my key decisions.
I chose Harry Kane and Jordan Henderson as captain and vice-captain not just because of their talent, but because of their professionalism on the training pitch, in the gym, and in how they lived their lives away from football.
They were role models I wanted others to emulate.
And over time, we created a culture where players were encouraged to take ownership... where young players were welcomed, not treated as outsiders... and where mistakes weren't ridiculed, but were seen as part of a process.
And some of the strongest decisions I took were made to protect our culture, whenever it was challenged, intentionally or not, by a lack of discipline or poor behaviours.
And so it is in society.
We need leaders to set the right tone... To be the role models we want for our young men. We have to show young men that character is more important than status. That how you treat others is more important than how much money you make.
That values matter... courage, humility, and integrity over selfishness, greed, arrogance.
The culture we create today will shape the kind of men that we inherit tomorrow.
We all have the power to create that culture. Small actions at an individual level ladder up to something far bigger at a societal level.
That is how we can make changes in our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities. And, yes, in our nation as well.
With England, we gave ourselves the best chance to succeed.
And we must give our young men the best chance to succeed as well.
Having covered identity, connection and culture, it feels like a good moment to address the definition of success for young men in society today
Of course, in football, some people see success as a zero sum game. Only one team wins the league. Only one team can win the World Cup.
And I agree that in sport, winning a trophy is a hugely important marker.
Do I wish we had won the Euros? More than you will ever know.
But even in professional sport, is winning a trophy the only marker of success?
Are we, for example, dismissing the Olympic athlete who wins a silver medal after a lifetime of endeavour, but loses out because on the day someone ran a few hundredths of a second faster?
If I've learned anything from my life in football, it's that success is about much more than the final score. It isn't a straight line. And it's not a single moment.
Take Harry Kane who was released by Arsenal, I wonder if he's still got the letter, had several unconvincing loan spells, but has gone on to be England's record goal scorer.
Everyone will remember Ollie Watkins scoring the winning goal in the semi-final of our Euros against Holland, but not so many will remember that he started his career playing non-league football.
An overnight success after 20 years.
And of course Bukayo Saka, I smile as soon as I see his name, who after his experience in Euro 2020, displayed quite remarkable resilience, courage, and belief in stepping up to successfully score his penalty against Switzerland last summer.
None of them had a perfect, uninterrupted journey to success. Because true success is how you respond in the hardest moments. It's about having the belief and resilience to persevere.
And that's the message we need to offer young men today.
Not everyone will win trophies. Not everyone will be at the top of their field.
But everyone can live a life where they can constantly strive to improve.
Where they can look back and say: I gave my best, I stayed true to myself, and I made a difference.
That is real success.
And the sooner we teach young men that, the sooner we help them find belief in themselves.
When I think back to that challenging, life-defining night at Wembley in Euro 96, I remember not just the miss, but what followed - and what gave me hope.
I was in a daze. Terry Venables comforted me while Tony Adams dragged me around the stadium to face and thank the fans.
But it was Stuart Pearce who truly understood what I was going through. He had missed a crucial penalty in the 1990 World Cup semi-final, ironically, though somewhat inevitably, also against Germany!
Back at the hotel, Stuart sat with me over dinner and explained what I'd face in the coming weeks.
He told me about the sleepless nights that would follow; what the front pages of every newspaper would be the next morning; and how, for years to come, people would hurl abuse in my direction, reminding me of my penalty miss.
He was right about all of that.
But he also had a wonderful way of putting it all into perspective. I remember him saying: ""Gareth, tomorrow I'm going home to feed the horses. I'll look at them and say, 'We lost to Germany again on penalties.' And they'll answer: 'Well what do we care? Give us some carrots!'""
He made me smile, and he was there for me when I needed him the most, and I was delighted to hear him in typically great spirits when I spoke to him a couple of days ago.
One of the most important things Stuart did for me in those dark days back in 1996, was to explain how this experience would make me stronger.
Now frankly, I didn't believe him at the time. But slowly, Stuart's words proved to be true.
He forced me to ask the hard questions: What do I stand for? How do I move forward? How do I make sure this is just one chapter and not the whole book?
I will let others judge whether it made me a better player. But missing that penalty was undoubtedly a watershed moment that made me a stronger, better man.
It forced me to dig deep, and revealed an inner belief and resilience that I never knew existed.
At the beginning of the lecture, I said I was going to talk about two penalties.
Up to now, I've only spoken about one.
Twenty-two years after missing that penalty, I found myself watching another penalty shoot-out - only this time I was the England manager, we were playing against Colombia, for a place in the quarter-final of the 2018 World Cup.
The game has been one of those typical England nights, absolute rollercoaster. We somehow managed to concede in the last minute of normal time, for context England haven't won a knockout game for 10 years and have lost all five of its previous penalty shoot-outs – so, I can imagine most of the country were hiding behind the sofa, Meanwhile I was actually pretty confident... mainly because I wasn't taking the penalty this time.
But by failing in 1996, it helped me to understand what was required now.
The decisive penalty fell to Eric Dier, not one of our superstars or a regular penalty taker. But a brilliant team man.
And this was his moment.
And as my eyes followed him on that long, lonely walk to the penalty spot, I hoped - maybe prayed a little – that he would help us to write a new chapter in English football history.
Because this time, it felt different. And this time, it was different.
If you look at the photos of my reaction, you can probably see the decades of pain. For me personally, that moment wasn't just relief, but it was a small step of redemption.
More importantly something in the English football mindset had changed. By instilling a belief and resilience in our players, we had broken down one more barrier to winning.
In 1996, I had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing I would miss.
In 2018, Eric had walked those same 30 yards believing he would score.
And so, in conclusion, I'd like to say this to young people, and to young men in particular:
Each of you will face your own version of that penalty moment. For most, it won't be on a football pitch in front of 90,000 people.
Maybe it's the moment you didn't do as well as you hoped to in an exam.
The moment you get rejected from a job.
Or the moment you just feel like someone has let you down.
BUT in that moment, you have a choice: do you let disappointment define you? Do you give up?
Or do you get back up, learn from it, and keep going?
That choice - the ability to build belief, to find resilience - is what makes the difference.
Not just in football.
Not just in sport.
But in life.
And I believe, as a society, we must do more to help young people, and especially young men, make the right choices in life.
We must create a world where they find comfort in their own identity and a sense of belonging to those around them; where they feel they live in a culture that doesn't judge them only by how well they succeed, but by how much they grow... by the effort they put in... and the character they develop;
and where they know there is always someone there to provide the love and support they need, especially in difficult times.
That is how we will create a young generation, a society, and a nation of which we can all be very proud.
And I'm looking forward to playing whatever role I can to help make it happen.
Thank you.

BBC News, Wiltshire","A driver has admitted killing a mother and daughter in a crash on the M4.
Cheryl Woods, 61, and her daughter Sarha Smith, 40, of Caerphilly, died in the multi-vehicle crash on 20 October 2023 between junction 17 for Chippenham and junction 18 for Bath.
Firas Zeineddine, 46, pleaded guilty to two charges of causing death by careless driving at Swindon Crown Court on Wednesday.
Sarha leaves behind six daughters, and in a family statement Mrs Woods was described as a ""doting grandmother"".
Zeineddine, of Keynsham near Bristol, had originally been charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving but admitted the lesser charges, and will be sentenced on 28 April.
Edward Culver, prosecuting, said Zeineddine's pleas were acceptable, and the Crown Prosecution Service would not be seeking a trial.
At the time of their deaths, Ms Woods and Ms Smith were described as being ""devoted"" by their families.
""Cheryl Woods, cherished by those in her life, fulfilled the roles of a loving mother, doting grandmother, cherished sister, and a dear friend,"" the tribute read.
""Her selflessness was a defining trait, consistently prioritising her family's well-being over her own, and she took immense pride in her Welsh heritage while nurturing a deep love for nature.""
The family added that Sarha Smith, ""in the footsteps of her mother, unselfishly devoted herself to her family's needs ahead of her own"".
""She was not only a mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and friend, but her absence leaves a void for those who relied on her radiant presence,"" they said.
""Her legacy lives on through her six daughters, who will forever hold her memory close and strive to honour her with their efforts.""

It said it accepted Brian was ""innocent"" of the sexual offences he had been wrongly imprisoned for, but he had failed to prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that he had not committed the crimes.
Brian had been completely cleared of the sex abuse charges he had been jailed for in 2017.
A five-year legal battle had culminated in the Court of Appeal finding his conviction unsafe. Brian's legal team produced a detailed defence including new witnesses and fresh forensic evidence, at a three-week retrial in 2023. The jury unanimously returned a verdict of ""not guilty"" in just over an hour.
During the struggle to clear his name, Brian used savings and family loans to pay for his legal fees - totalling £500,000. This is equal to the total amount of compensation that Brian was able to apply for.
The letter from the Ministry of Justice came nearly a year after he first submitted his application. The assessor, who had never spoken to Brian or his legal team, said he wasn't eligible for a pay-out because there was not enough proof that he had hadn't carried out the offences.
""What do I need to do to prove that I'm an innocent person?"" says Brian. ""I've lost five years of my life, my job, my pension. People are absolutely gobsmacked when you tell them I've been refused compensation.""
The Ministry of Justice told the BBC it acknowledges the ""grave impact of miscarriages of justice"" and is ""committed to supporting individuals in rebuilding their lives"".
For hundreds of years it has been accepted that someone is presumed innocent until a court of law finds them guilty.
However, following a small but significant law change in 2014, if a victim of a miscarriage of justice in England and Wales wants to receive compensation, they must not only be cleared, but also demonstrate they are innocent - in effect ""reversing the burden of proof"", according to Brian's barrister, Stephen Vullo KC.
""It's an almost impossibly high hurdle over which very few people can jump,"" he says.
About 93% of applications for compensation have been rejected by the Ministry of Justice since 2016, government figures show.
Mr Vullo believes the legislation change was designed so that money would not be paid out. ""It's not by accident, it's by design,"" he says.
The current system is ""inhuman"" and ""cruel"" says Suzanne Gower, a former criminal defence solicitor and specialist in miscarriages of justice at the University of Manchester. She believes it sends a message that the state doesn't accept responsibility when it causes harm.
Several legal experts told us the special compensation schemes set up by the government for victims of the Post Office scandal were ""a tacit admission"" that the existing system is ""unfair"" and not working.
Ms Gower says while sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted for theft and fraud deserve ""every penny for what they've been through"" they were only able to claim compensation after the TV drama about the case generated so much public pressure for action.
Mr Vullo says it is unfair to less-publicised cases if the government's approach is driven by a fear of being embarrassed.
""The system should be set up fairly so that everybody receives compensation,"" he tells us.
Introducing the law change in 2014, the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government argued it would stop compensation going to people who only had their conviction quashed on a technicality, and therefore might be guilty.
But Lewis Ross, who specialises in legal and political philosophy at the London School of Economics, says this was achieved at the expense of innocent people who had been falsely imprisoned.
""There does need to be some standard for compensation,"" says Mr Ross. ""It's just curious the government picked the most demanding one.""
There are now growing calls for the 2014 law to be reversed so a person would only need to show they had been a victim of a miscarriage of justice to receive compensation.
That is the system still used in Scotland, Northern Ireland and most of the rest of Europe.
The Law Commission is currently compiling a review for the government on how to reform the criminal appeals system in England and Wales, which includes compensation for victims of miscarriages of justice.
It also acknowledges that the current legislation is too severe and has provisionally proposed that claimants could still be asked to prove their innocence, but be expected to meet a lower evidential threshold.
The government says it will need to consider the commission's findings, due to be released in 2026, before deciding how to act.
Brian, who is from Pembrokeshire, now has the support of his local MP - Ben Lake - who will host a debate at Westminster. Mr Lake says he was ""appalled"" after hearing about Brian's case.
""Sadly, miscarriages of justice happen. They always have and they always will,"" he says. ""But when we have a situation where an individual has been incarcerated for whatever reason for incorrect evidence or incorrect judgements, we should ensure that they are compensated for that.""
Any law change should be made retrospectively so the Buckle family could benefit, Mr Lake adds.
Brian describes the help from his MP as a ""step forward"", not just for him but for other victims of a miscarriage of justice.
""I'm definitely not the old Brian Buckle,"" he says. ""I can't keep a job down because my head is all over the place. Every single night all I dream about is being in prison or trying to get out of prison.""
The events of the past few years have taken their toll, not only on Brian - who has been formally diagnosed with PTSD - but also on his family.
His daughter Georgia says she suffered from suicidal thoughts during her father's imprisonment.
After an eight-year ordeal, Brian believes there needs to be change to a ""broken"" justice system. He says he would like an apology, and some recognition that the authorities made a mistake.
""I will take what happened to me to the grave,"" he says. ""Money is not going to change how I am mentally, but it's the principle of the justice system admitting that they got it wrong.""",UK

Culture reporter•@NoorNanji","Documents relating to the Duke of Sussex's US visa application have been unsealed in court.
They are heavily redacted, however, and no details have been given as to what Prince Harry put on his immigration form.
A US court had ordered the release of the documents based on a freedom of information request by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative US think tank in Washington DC.
The foundation alleges that the prince concealed his past use of drugs, which should have disqualified him from obtaining a US visa.
The allegations are around his claims in his memoir Spare, where he referred to taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms.
Application forms for US visas specifically ask about current and past drug use.
Admissions of drug use can lead to non-immigrant and immigrant visa applications being rejected, although immigration officers have discretion to make a final decision based on different factors.
In the event, very little information was disclosed in the documents which were released on Tuesday.
The prince's visa form has not been released.
Instead, the documents that were released are supporting declarations and court transcripts created in the course of Heritage Foundation's case.
They reveal that the US government previously told a court that the duke could be subjected to harassment if his visa records were made public.
A chief freedom of information officer within the US Department for Homeland Security (DHS) could be seen to argue that releasing the material ""would potentially expose the individual to harm from members of the public"".
The declaration from Jarrod Panter, submitted to the court in April last year, reads: ""The USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) routinely protects from disclosure the non-immigrant/immigrant status sought by third parties who do not have permission from the beneficiary to receive this information.
""To release such information would potentially expose the individual to harm from members of the public who might have a reason to manipulate or harass individuals depending on their status in the United States.""
The declaration added: ""To release his exact status could subject him to reasonably foreseeable harm in the form of harassment as well as unwanted contact by the media and others.""
Sam Dewey from the Heritage Foundation told the BBC that he believes the DHS has not provided all its papers. He said he is ""frustrated"" and that this is ""not the end of the road"".
Dewey expects the next move to be a ""sort of filing"" that could lay out the next steps, adding: ""We may well have another lawsuit against Department of Homeland Security.""
He accuses the prince of privilege, alleging he has benefitted from his ""wealth and status"" by being allowed to live in the US.
In his controversial memoir, published in January 2023, Prince Harry wrote that he first tried cocaine at the age of 17.
""It wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,"" he added.
He also wrote about using marijuana, saying ""cocaine didn't do anything for me"", but ""marijuana is different, that actually really did help me"".
Cocaine is a highly addictive drug, with a range of short and long-term effects, according to the NHS. Marijuana (cannabis) can make some existing mental health symptoms worse and has been linked with the possible development of mental health issues.
The court's decision that the files be released came after a 2024 ruling which said there was not enough public interest in disclosing Prince Harry's immigration records.
The Heritage Foundation contested that ruling and pushed for the judgement to be changed.
Prince Harry moved to the US with his wife Meghan in 2020 after stepping down as a working royal. It is not clear what visa he entered the country on, while the duchess is a US citizen.
President Donald Trump previously ruled out deporting Prince Harry in February, telling the New York Post: ""I'll leave him alone... He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.""
Meghan has been a vocal critic of Trump in the past, labelling him a ""misogynist"".
The BBC has contacted the duke's office for comment.",UK

BBC News","Three men have been jailed for importing cocaine into Jersey.
Shahiukh Syed Gilani was sentenced to six years and 10 months in prison, Terence O'Hagan to five years and Reece McLaren to seven years in the Royal Court on Monday.
The States of Jersey Police said officers had arrested the men in June 2024 after a surveillance operation tracked them meeting and receiving a postal package containing 66g (2.3oz) of the Class A drug.
Police said McLaren, 29, from Huddersfield, and Gilani, 39, from London, had met with Jersey resident O'Hagan, 64, and asked him for his contacts as they wanted to become the island's main suppliers of cocaine.
Officers said McLaren and Gilani had stayed in Jersey from 13 to 16 June, during which time the pair imported 7g of cocaine and met with Terence O'Hagan.
Police said the pair returned to the island on 20 June and the following day officers intercepted a parcel of 66g of cocaine posted to the holiday property McLaren and Gilani were staying in.
Officers arrested the men after the package had been delivered.
The police said the estimated street value of the imported drugs was between £9,900 and £16,500.
Det Insp Christina Maclennan, of the States Police drug squad, said officers would ""do our utmost to prosecute anyone who imports and or deals drugs in Jersey"".

BBC News, West Midlands","A man who posed as a young boy to ask a nine-year-old girl to send nude pictures has been jailed.
Joshua Wilson of Alice Close, Bedworth, pretended to be a 12-year-old boy when he approached the girl, from Gwent, Wales, in 2024.
The 27-year-old was reported by the family of the girl, who spotted the messages on her phone.
Wilson was jailed for four years at Warwick Crown Court on 7 March.
After he was reported by the girl's parents, detectives found evidence on his phone of sexual conversations with other young girls.
They found indecent photos and videos of children, some of whom were believed to be as young as five or six.
Wilson was charged and later pleaded guilty to attempting to cause a child to look at an image of sexual activity, causing or inciting a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity, two counts of engaging in sexual communications with a child and three counts of making an indecent image of children.
Det Sgt Dave Moorman from Warwickshire Police's Online Child Sexual Exploitation Team (OCSET), said: ""The parents of the nine-year-old girl from Gwent were fortunately vigilant and monitored their child's use of the phone.
""This is how they spotted the messages shared with Wilson.

BBC News","Prisoners will be temporarily held in police cells to deal with prisons running out of space, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has confirmed.
The emergency measures, called Operation Safeguard, are triggered when prisons are close to capacity.
The government says 200 police cells will be freed up by the measures, which are expected to last for two months but could be extended depending on the size of the prison population.
The announcement comes shortly before a new prison near York is scheduled to open. HMP Millsike will create 1,500 new spaces that the government hopes will reduce pressure on the criminal justice system.
While the system is close to full capacity, the MoJ said there is still space.
Figures released on Monday show the number of prisoners is at a six-month high, with 87,556 people currently in custody.
The male prison estate is currently operating at more than 99% occupancy, the MoJ said.
This is not the first time Operation Safeguard has been triggered and has been introduced during periods of high demand for prison space - including in May 2024 and February 2023.
In a statement, the MoJ said it had ""inherited a prison system in crisis"".
A spokesperson said the measures offered ""temporary relief"" while the government worked to build a further 14,000 new prison places and reform sentencing.
Last year, the government released more than 2000 prisoners early as part of an emergency plan to ease overcrowding in the system.
Offenders serving sentences of more than five years were released on license after spending more than 40% of their time behind bars.
Prisoners convicted of serious violence, sex crimes and terrorism were excluded from the scheme.
Many of those released early came from open prisons, meaning they had been working toward rehabilitation.
The government has outlined a plan to deliver 14,000 more prison places in England and Wales by 2031, which included building new prisons, adding new blocks to existing prisons, and opening temporary cells.
David Gauke, former Conservative justice secretary, was asked to lead a sentencing review in autumn last year. The expert panel was tasked with re-evaluating the country's sentencing framework.
Proposals being considered by the panel include the scrapping of short prison sentences and measures to toughen up community orders as an alternative to jail.
The panel is expected to publish its findings by spring 2025.
The Prison Reform Trust said the wellbeing and safety of prisoners and prison staff, as well as the criminal justice system's functionality, has been compromised by the ""capacity crisis"".
Pia Sinha, chief executive of the charity, said: ""It will not be possible for the government to build its way out of this crisis.""
The sentencing review ""will be vital to bringing our use of imprisonment down to a sustainable level"", she added.",UK

BBC News, West Midlands
Phil McCann
BBC North West Tonight","A paedophile who stole a terminally ill man's identity and spent almost three decades on the run has been convicted of 54 child sex abuse charges.
Richard Burrows ""acted like a coward and fled the country"" leaving his victims to suffer, police said after he was convicted at Chester Crown Court.
During his trial this year, the court was told he had abused boys as young as nine while a housemaster at a Cheshire boarding school and as a scout master in the West Midlands between the late 1960s and mid-1990s.
He had previously admitted 43 out of 105 charges. The prosecution did not offer evidence for eight counts and he had denied the remaining 54 but was found guilty of all of them.
Burrows, 80, formerly of Birmingham, will be sentenced on 7 April.
He was arrested at Heathrow Airport last year after almost three decades on the run, having failed to appear at his originally scheduled trial over alleged child sex offences at the same court in 1997.
The court heard how between 1968 and 1995, Burrows systematically abused 24 young boys across the Cheshire, West Midlands and West Mercia areas.
Allegations against Burrows partly related to his time as a housemaster at Danesford School in Congleton, Cheshire, between 1969 and 1971. The school has since closed.
Police said the abuse would often take place in toilets at night when he would wake boys on the pretence that he wanted to stop them wetting the bed.
The jury heard one of his accusers told police he ""hated"" the abuse, which would happen as much as two to three times per week, but said he ""could do nothing about it"", adding ""I was frightened and young"".
The court was told the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ""did not think he would be believed"" if he reported the abuse.
During his trial, Burrows told the court he had fled to Thailand because he wanted to go sailing and had not carried out the offences.
He said he wanted to return to the UK after 27 years as he had run out of money.
The abuse during his time with scout groups was said to have taken place in Sutton Coldfield and Streetly and on trips to Wales, Ross-on-Wye, the Cotswolds and London.
One of his victims, James Harvey, who waived his anonymity, told the BBC that Burrows was an ""appalling, manipulative abuser"".
He spoke about how Burrows had tried to sexually assault him when he was a member of the sea scouts in Walsall, which he joined in his teens.
He said he had woken to find Burrows ""trying to get down into my sleeping bag"".
""I think I just grabbed hold of his hand or shrugged or flipped back with my head or did something until it stopped,"" he added.
Mr Harvey said the fact Burrows had been able to get a British passport to leave the country and live for several decades in Thailand was ""utterly disgusting"".
""I can still feel that man's hands on my skin, on my shoulder, and on my chest,"" he said.
Detectives had spent 27 years trying to find Burrows, a Cheshire Police spokesperson said.
But officers were unable to trace him, despite a number of appeals on the BBC's Crimewatch programme, which led to more accusers coming forward.
There was no trace of him until 2023 when officers used specialist software to search for any possible images of him online and found a man using the name Peter Smith, in Phuket, Thailand.
Officers discovered Burrows had stolen the name of a terminally ill acquaintance and illegally got a passport in 1997.
Before they began the extradition process, they found he had planned to return to the UK.
After the verdicts, Det Insp Eleanor Atkinson said Burrows systematically abused his victims.
""Rather than face the consequences of his actions, he acted like a coward and fled the country using a stolen identity taken from an unwell man,"" she said.
Burrows spent three decades ""living in paradise"" - the 80-year-old's own description of Thailand - while his victims were ""left to suffer as they struggled to try and rebuild their lives"", she added.
Det Insp Atkinson said four victims had died before they could see him brought to justice.
An NSPCC spokesman said: ""Burrows repeatedly exploited positions of trust he had gained in the community including as a scout leader and a school housemaster.""
He said he had caused ""even more pain to those who suffered at his hands"" by evading justice for almost 30 years.
The charity said it was never too late for survivors of sexual abuse to speak out and get help.

The peak, expected on the spring equinox, is seven or eight degrees warmer than average in the region for this time of year, according to BBC Weather.
West Wales, along with central and south England, will have the best chance of the highest temperatures, but it will depend on cloud cover.
In the north of the UK, temperatures are expected to reach 10C in Edinburgh and 13C in Belfast.

The week will start off with frosty nights and around average daytime high temperatures.
Monday will be fairly cloudy, but it will turn sunnier from the east late in the day, leading to a largely sunny Tuesday.
Wednesday looks mainly fine in the north, but there will be some cloud and a slight chance of a shower across the southern half of the UK. Daytime highs will be in the mid-teens across the south of the UK, but low teens further north.
On Thursday, any mist and fog should lift, leaving another mostly fine day. Winds from the south will bring in warmer air.
Highs in the north will be in the low to mid-teens, with mid-to-high teens across central and southern parts of the UK.
However, on Thursday night, rain may start to spread from the south, leading to a more unsettled and slightly cooler day on Friday.

BBC News","The father of one of the girls killed at a dance class in Southport last year says his local community has been ""so kind"" and ""amazing with us"" as he prepares to run a fundraising marathon.
Sergio Aguiar is raising money to build a new playground, including a performance stage and library, at Churchtown Primary School, where his daughter Alice was a pupil.
Sergio, whose daughter was nine when she died, told BBC Breakfast: ""I feel like we're doing something great. In the next few years, thousands of children will enjoy that playground.""
He is running the London Marathon next month as part of a community effort to raise £250,000 for the project.
""We always said that the school felt like a second home to Alice,"" said Sergio. ""She had a 100% attendance record last year – she never missed a day.""
The playground will also be dedicated to Bebe King, who died in the same attack aged six, as she had previously attended the school.
Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, was also killed at the dance class in July last year. Axel Rudakubana, 18, was sentenced in January to a minimum of 52 years in prison for their murders.
Sergio, who is the first of the victims' parents to give a live interview, added: ""[Alice] would be very proud of us [creating] this playground. I can imagine how happy she would be to see it. I wish she could have enjoyed it.""
With six weeks until the marathon, Sergio's training efforts appear to be going well after undertaking an 18-mile run recently.
He has even started taking ice baths at home to aid his preparation. He said: ""I think it is harder than the training!""
Joining him on the run will be Jinnie Payne, the head teacher at Churchtown Primary School, who said the building of the playground would be completed by September if they could reach the fundraising target.
""That is [the start of] Alice's classmates' final year at Churchtown and they would have that playground to play in … the legacy of Alice and Bebe,"" she told BBC Breakfast.
Alan Bowen, who was Alice's favourite teacher, said he could imagine how she would have enjoyed playing with the other children on the new playground's stage.
""It would be easy to see [her] dancing and performing, singing, twirling her hair and leading everybody else"".
He said Alice loved to perform and that the stage would provide a ""space where children are going to show off their flair, their sass – and Alice had sass in bucketloads"".
Alan will not be running the marathon due to his knees, joking ""I'm of an age where I can use that as an excuse"", but will be supporting those that do.
Other parents and staff from the school will also be participating in the Blackpool festival of running to help raise funds for the project.
""It is a positive way, a tangible way, for the community to get involved,"" explained Jinnie. ""But for the children and the families it is … to feel part of building something together.""
As of Saturday morning, more than half of the fundraising target has been achieved with individual donations ranging from a few pounds to £10,000 given by an anonymous individual.
""People are so kind,"" Sergio said, thanking the community for their support. ""They come up to me and say 'well done, the playground will be amazing.'""
Footballers Diogo Jota and Beto, who play for Liverpool and Everton respectively, sent surprise messages of encouragement via the BBC to Sergio - who settled in the UK after moving from Portugal.
Beto, speaking in Portuguese, said: ""Hello Sergio, hello Mrs Payne. Beto here from Everton. I want to send you a message to wish you best of luck for the London Marathon. What you are doing is fantastic and we hope the training is going well. You have all of the support from everyone at Everton. Take care and best of luck.""
Jota told Sergio: ""Hello Sergio, I just heard you were about to run the London Marathon for an amazing cause. We are all with you here at Liverpool, so go on and do your best!""
Sergio, smiling, thanked them for the messages and revealed he had a Jota shirt at home because he is a Porto fan, where Jota played before moving to the Premier League in 2017.",UK

BBC News","Volunteers will be picking up litter from beaches across the Channel Islands in a mass clean-up of the coastline.
Organisers said the seventh annual Big Channel Islands Beach Clean Up on Saturday and Sunday will see people cleaning beaches in Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark - as well as the Isle Of Man.
They said volunteers across the British Crown Dependencies were being encouraged to do their bit to ""preserve and protect our beaches, coastal areas and local wildlife"".
Participants are asked to bring a bucket and a pair of gloves to collect any marine pollution they find and send details of interesting finds to the organisers.
The litter picking events include meet-ups at L'Etacq, Harve Des Pas and La Rocque in Jersey on Saturday and at Long Beach and Ouaisne Bay on Sunday.
Alderney Wildlife Trust is running an event at Hanaine and Clonque on Saturday.
The Sociéte Sercquaise will be holding a clean up on Sark at Port a la Jument on Saturday and at L'Eperquerie on Sunday.
Alderney Wildlife Trust said it would record every item people found along a 100m stretch of beach – from tiny microplastics to larger debris for the Marine Conservation Society to track litter sources.
For the first time this year, the Big Channel Islands Beach Clean Up will also include the Isle Of Man.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0599vd8yyo,Search for people shown in nostalgic Cunard photos,2025-03-15T07:37:12.121Z,,"Celebrated cruise liner company Cunard is hoping to track down people depicted in photos from years gone by for a nostalgic photo exhibition to celebrate 185 years of ocean travel.
To mark its anniversary, the luxury shipping firm has collected images from former guests, workers and newspaper archives and wants to uncover some of the stories behind them.
One of the photographs, which will go on display in the Sea of Glamour exhibition in Liverpool in May, shows a couple leaning in for a kiss as British troops bid farewell before leaving Southampton on the QE2 during the Falklands War in 1982.
The liner was converted into a troop ship at the time.
Organisers also hope to identify a team of cleaners on board the QE2 in 1975.
The 26 women, in matching uniforms, posed on the deck for the newspaper photo, with the caption revealing they were known as ""cyclic cleaners"" because of the constant circle of work in keeping the ship clean.
It named one of them as Linda McAndrew, from Bournemouth, Dorset, who would help clean seven spiral staircases - each 13 storeys high.
In the piece, she said: ""Often I'm cleaning one side and they're already dropping sweet papers and cigarette ash on the side I've just cleaned.""
The team behind the exhibition also want to track David Lawrence, shown in a picture from 1982 standing on the QE2's lifeboat, which he bought at auction and kept in the drive of his semi-detached home in the village of Llanharry, outside Cardiff.
A group of young men shown in 1967 playing football beneath the hull of the QE2 at the Clydebank shipyard, near Glasgow - where it was built - are also featured in the exhibition.
If they are tracked down, their stories could be included in the display.
Lee Powell, vice president of brand and product at Cunard, said they had been ""overwhelmed by the incredible response to our call for photos"".
""Among the wonderful submissions, these particular images truly stood out to us, capturing some of the behind-the-scenes moments of the curation of our ships and the remarkable people who have helped shape Cunard's rich history,"" he said.
""We would love to uncover the stories behind these photographs and we're hoping the public can help us reconnect with the people featured so their stories can become a memorable part of our Sea of Glamour exhibition.""
Organisers appealed for anyone with relevant information to send details to cunardphotography@cunard.co.uk.
The Sea of Glamour exhibition will be curated by photographer Mary McCartney, daughter of Beatles star Sir Paul McCartney, and will launch at the Liver Building on 28 May before sailing around the world on the Cunard fleet.

BBC News, West of England","A bike ride held in honour of a rugby campaigner who fought to make the sport safer has raised more than £6,000 for charity.
Tom Morris died aged 46 last year, just weeks after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Mr Morris, who is from Cheltenham but lived in Bristol for many years, worked for Progressive Rugby, an advocacy group committed to improving player welfare by reducing the risk of concussions and brain trauma.
Retired orthopaedic surgeon Professor John Fairclough, a fellow member of Progressive Rugby, said: ""It's terribly important that we recognise the impact that Tom made.""
The money raised from the bike ride will be split between Head for Change, which supports ex-players with neurodegenerative diseases, and St Peter's Hospice in Bristol, which cared for Mr Morris in his final days.
The cyclists started their ride at Gloucester Rugby Club and made their way to Cardiff.
Former Welsh international Ian Gough, who took part in the cycle, has been part of Progressive Rugby since its inception.
He told the BBC the organisation's aim was to make sure the game was ""as safe as it possibly can be"".
""We don't want to take out the contact or what makes rugby great, but it's about making it safe so everyone can enjoy it,"" he added.
Of the cycling challenge, Mr Gough said: ""If anyone wants to come out and push me up any hills or install a battery in my bike, I'm down.
""That's what rugby is like, when you're going through a bit of a dark place you've got your mates around to help and give you a little push.
""When you feel a bit better further on down the track, you can reciprocate that.""
Professor Fairclough, who was involved in the development of sports medicine and research in Wales, said: ""[Mr Morris] brought together a group of people who were involved in concussions in sport, and injuries in sport, which produce long-term problems.
""The most important thing that Tom did was leave a legacy. It's incredible that after five years he managed to generate such a following of people who wanted to support what he had, which was the wish to carry on.
""To not stop rugby, which was his passion, but rather to make rugby the game that we all love, but to recognise there are dangers.
""The legacy of Tom is the fact that we're all here today, all supporting people in the cycle race.""

Mackenzie Bailey, 18, from Yate, was among the crowd of Bristol City fans who descended on Cardiff city centre ahead of a match versus Cardiff City on 15 February.
He was seen by officers throwing a can of alcohol at the O'Neill's public house on Wood Street.
Bailey was subsequently arrested for a Section 4 Public Order.
The banning order prevents Bailey from entering any premises in the UK for the purpose of attending any football matches.
When matches are played outside the UK, he must report to a named police station and surrender his passport.
PC Simon Chivers, from South Wales Police, said: ""Whenever there is evidence of football-related disorder we always pursue those responsible in order that appropriate action is taken.
""The vast majority of football fans behave respectfully - it is individuals like this who give football fans and their clubs a bad name.
""There is no place for it and it won't be tolerated.""
In addition to the banning order, Bailey was given a £500 fine and ordered to pay £85 cost and a £200 surcharge.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedlvwyv7e6o,The film exploring loneliness of migrant workers,2025-03-14T06:17:45.125Z,"Ana da Silva
BBC News, Bristol","Loneliness and the precarious work prospects of immigrant workers are themes explored in a new film written and directed by Scotland-based film maker Laura Carreira. In 'On Falling', her first feature film, she highlights the isolation and insecurity that comes with some jobs.
Imagine working in a huge warehouse, scanning items in a job dictated by the bleep of a machine, knowing your productivity is being constantly monitored.
Then, when work is finished, you go home to your shared accommodation, where you sit on your own eating cheap meals as that is all you can afford, and spend much of your time 'doom scrolling' on social media.
That is the life of Aurora, a character in the film 'On Falling'. A timid and lonely female migrant, she works as a 'picker' in a Scottish warehouse.
The film illustrates the precariousness of 'gig work' and the importance of human connection.
""We follow her in a week where she's struggling to make ends meet and also struggling with loneliness and alienation,"" said Ms Carreira.
""I started reading a lot about the gig economy and I discovered the job of a picker,"" said Ms Carreira.
""When companies talk about efficiency and how quickly a parcel gets to you, I was expecting it to come from technology, but actually it's someone rushing around a warehouse, getting the item as fast as they can and being told to the second how long they have to get there.
""Immediately I thought - there is a film here.""
Having moved to Scotland at the young age of 18 to study film in Edinburgh, Ms Carreira says that gave her the perspective to tell the story from the viewpoint of an immigrant.
""I started interviewing pickers and realised a lot are economic migrants. I realised I could tell this story and I could tell it through a Portuguese female character as well.
""Those first years were hard, you know? You don't have any social ties to the country and you are trying to belong. You experience the loneliness and the exploitation closer to your skin because when you don't have those ties you have less security and less protections.
""But I really think that what she's going through is pretty universal, anyone who works can probably relate to elements of what Aurora is going through.""
'On Falling' had its preview at the London Film Festival last October.
It is being shown at the Watershed cinema in Bristol until 20 March, in a partnership with the Glasgow Film Festival, and is also screening at 54 more cinemas across the UK.
""I think it is part of the immigrant's experience to go into another country looking for a better life and it might not be there,"" Ms Carreira said.
""Of course sometimes you do find your way and you find a sense of belonging. And I think that can be a really positive experience when you come from another country, you're speaking a different language, and after so many years you're part of it.""
Despite the struggles of Aurora in the film, Ms Carreira said she wanted to bring a more positive issue to light.
""Even though the film can be dark at points, for me it was really important to preserve the kindness of others,"" she said.
""I think sometimes we find ourselves in these strange positions, with this entire idea that we're out there competing against each other.
""But in reality, I think people really care for each other and as migrant that's a perspective that you get, and I wanted to bring that into the film.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq2y5pnvnzo,Ratepayers covering rectory costs could be axed,2025-03-13T12:55:07.088Z,"George Thorpe
BBC News","A requirement for ratepayers in Guernsey parishes to pay for rectories could be scrapped.
The States of Guernsey is due to debate a Policy and Resources Committee report on Wednesday linked to a dispute involving Torteval and St Saviour parishes over the maintenance costs of a Church of England rectory.
However, an amendment from Deputies Al Brouard and Susan Aldwell to the Parochial Church Property (Guernsey) Law 2015 has called for a requirement for parishes to provide and cover clergy housing costs to be stopped from 2035.
The deputies said they felt the obligation to provide rectories free of charge had become ""difficult to justify"" in the 21st Century.
Currently, Guernsey's parishes are required to provide housing for rectors with the costs covered by ratepayers.
Historically, parish-owned land has helped fund rectories but additional income is needed to meet rising housing costs
The States said there was a dispute involving the maintenance costs of the St Saviour rectory, which is occupied by a rector covering both the St Saviour and Torteval parishes.
The government said St Saviour believed the costs should be covered by both parishes, but Torteval has argued it was not required to do so as the rectory was not in their parish.
The amendment proposed the obligation should be stopped from 1 January, 2035 to provide a ""lengthy transitional period"" to discuss accommodation arrangements and other issues.
In their amendment, Brouard and Aldwell said there were a number of reasons why they felt the obligation to parishes to pay for rectories should be removed.
These included parishioners having more varied religious backgrounds, more pressure on parish funds and Guernsey being a ""more secular society"".
""The basis of a continued duty or obligation to provide rectors and their households with housing free of charge is difficult to justify,"" the deputies said.
The BBC has approached the Dean of Guernsey Tim Barker for comment.
St Martin's Senior Constable Dave Beausire said he supported the amendment put forward, although he would like the obligation to be removed earlier than 2035.
He said a lot of the island's rectories were old buildings that needed a lot of maintenance.
He said this could cost ratepayers, including those who were not religious or who followed another faith, hundreds of thousands of pounds.
""This is not a religious issue, this is a practical issue,"" Beausire added.
""In this day and age, things need to change because there's always a cost and the cost is getting higher.""

UK correspondent","A new offence to cover lone individuals planning non-terrorist mass killings should be considered in the wake of the Southport attacks, the UK's terror watchdog has said.
The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall KC, suggested the offence, similar to that of preparing an act of terrorism, should have a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
However, he said the definition of terrorism should not be expanded or changed as it could lead to ""the prosecution of people who by no stretch of the imagination are terrorists"".
Axel Rudakubana stabbed six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Aguiar to death at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday class.
Terrorist material was found at Rudakubana's house, but police found no clear ideological reason for his attack so it was not classified as terrorism.
He also tried to murder eight other young girls and two adults who tried to save them, including the class organiser Leanne Lucas, during the attack last summer.
Police officers discovered ricin pulp and a copy of an al-Qaeda manual at Rudakubana's house.
Other evidence suggested he was interested in Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan, the Rwandan genocide and school massacres.
Following the attacks, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Britain faced a new threat from ""extreme violence carried out by loners, misfits, young men in their bedrooms"".
Mr Hall told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the internet was ""really causing problems here"".
""A lot of lone young men, generally, are getting these ideas from the internet that really extreme violence is the solution, and Rudakubana seems to have been one of those people,"" he added.
In January Sir Keir asked Mr Hall to identify any changes needed to the law as a result of the Southport murders.
Mr Hall said there was a clear risk to the public of people who are interested in carrying out acts of mass violence, including school massacres.
Currently there is no law against preparing for such an attack which ""means that no prosecution would be available if the police raided an address and found careful handwritten but uncommunicated plans for carrying out a massacre"".
As a result, he is recommending the government considers creating a new offence, similar to the offence of preparing an act of terrorism.
The offence would make it illegal to ""engage in any conduct"" in preparation of the killing of two or more people, what he calls ""non-terrorist mass casualty attack-planning"".
Mr Hall also considered whether the definition of terrorism itself should be changed to include mass violence without a political, religious, racial or other ideological motivation, but concluded it should not.
""Redefinition would alter the landscape. It would risk major false positives – the prosecution of people who by no stretch of the imagination are terrorists – and extend terrorism liability into novel terrain,"" Mr Hall said.
""People swapping violent war footage would be at risk of encouraging terrorism, resulting in unacceptable restrictions on freedom of expression.""
Giving another example to BBC Breakfast, Mr Hall added that ""a gangster who goes around local neighbourhood shops using terrorising violence to extort, or really extreme football hooligans"" would also wrongly have to be treated as terrorists if the definition was changed.
A government spokesperson said legislation would now be amended to incorporate Mr Hall's recommendations, adding today's report was ""an important step"" towards preventing an attack like this from happening again.
Downing Street also said police were looking into how misinformation spreads online after false information about the killings sparked riots across England and Northern Ireland.
The spokesperson added: ""We have asked the Law Commission to conclude its own review into the rules around contempt of court as soon as possible.""
As part of his report Mr Hall considered what should happen with young people like Rudakubana, who are referred to the counter-terrorism Prevent programme, but are not taken on because they do not have a clear ideology.
""If they are not to be managed by counter-terrorism police, who will 'own' the risk?"", he asked.
He said lessons should be learned from counter-terrorism, and generally it should be the police that take responsibility for public protection, rather than leaving it to other agencies like mental health services.
Mr Hall added that police should have been able to give more information to the media about the suspected attacker in the aftermath of the Southport murders.
""In the digital era, if the police do not take the lead in providing clear, accurate and sober details about an attack like Southport, others will.""
""Following Southport, the disinformation generated on social media, combined with widespread allegations of a 'cover-up', risked far more prejudice to any trial than the placement of undisputed facts about the attacker in the public domain,"" he said.",UK
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zwy0nex0o,'He strangled me without asking' - experts say choking during sex now normal for many,2025-03-13T06:30:37.703Z,"Sima Kotecha
Senior UK correspondent•@sima_kotecha","Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual assault
""He was on top of me - we were kissing and having sex, then suddenly he put his forearm on my neck and pressed hard with his full weight. I just froze.""
Rachel* had never slept with the man before. Speaking to the BBC, she says while the sex was consensual, the man began choking her without warning and without her consent - and that was deeply frightening.
""He just did it like it was normal and it caught me by surprise, so I just went with it,"" the 26-year-old says. ""I didn't lose consciousness, but this numbness came over me and I just waited for it to stop.""
It happened again a fortnight later, Rachel says, with another man whom she had met on a dating site. Like the previous occasion, there was no discussion about choking beforehand.
""The actual strangling is a blank in my memory,"" she says. ""His hands were round my neck, and then I disassociated with it until it ended.
""You go from feeling safe to losing control of the situation. I didn't have sex for a year afterwards because of how it made me feel alienated from my body.""
Both incidents were distressing for Rachel, who assumes the men who choked her must have seen it in pornography.
""It felt like it was - in their minds - just a normal part of sex.""
A recent government review found porn involving non-fatal strangulation (NFS) was ""rife"" and that its prevalence online was contributing to choking filtering into some people's sex lives - particularly among young people. The BBC has spoken to women who've experienced choking during sex - both willingly and not - and to experts who say, while it may be more common, it is illegal and highly dangerous.
When someone is strangled, pressure on the neck cuts off the blood supply to the brain, which can lead to feeling dizzy and light-headed. The level of oxygen in the body suddenly drops, while the build-up of carbon dioxide significantly increases. This can cause brain damage or even death.
Other risks include loss of consciousness, strokes, seizures, and speech disorders. Choking can also lead to psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and contribute to depression.
Despite the health risks, a recent survey by the government-funded charity the Institute For Addressing Strangulation (IFAS), suggests strangling is most common in the 16-34 age group, with 35% of respondents reporting they had been choked by a partner during consensual sex.
Some 16% of all UK-based respondents (385 out of 2,344) have been strangled once or more during consensual sex, and the data shows a slightly higher proportion of women have experienced it compared with men.
Half of the sample who had experienced it said they had agreed to it, while 17% said they hadn't.
Some people who engage in sexual asphyxiation say it intensifies pleasure - like Amanda*, who told the BBC she is regularly strangled by her boyfriend during what she calls rough sex.
""It gets us both off,"" the 28-year-old says. ""I find the idea of turning him on a turn on, and I trust that he won't go too far and put lots of pressure on.
""It's an intimate thing with the person you trust the most, so you feel safe.""
A quick search on a mainstream adult website, and it takes just seconds to find a series of porn films featuring long sequences of non-fatal strangulation (NFS).
The influence of pornography has resulted in strangulation becoming ""standard behaviour"" according to Prof Hannah Bows, from Durham University's Centre for Research into Violence and Abuse.
""What we've seen in the last 10 to 15 years is that it's become a glamorised, fantasised and celebrated form of 'normal' sexual encounters,"" she says.
Her conclusions are reinforced by the findings of the porn industry review commissioned by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It found content involving NFS was ""rife on mainstream platforms"", and recommended making, possessing or publishing porn showing women being strangled during sex, a crime. It isn't currently illegal to depict online.
The government also said further action is needed to address the findings that graphic strangulation is becoming normalised in real life.
Details of help and support with sexual abuse or violence are available in the UK at BBC Action Line
NFS was made a specific offence in England and Wales in 2022, with a maximum prison sentence of five years. About 700 offenders were sentenced for non-fatal strangulation or suffocation offences between July 2022 and June 2023, crime statistics shared with the BBC show.
There are no statistics on the number of people who have died from strangulation while having sex. The latest femicide census shows of the 2,000 women aged 14 or above who had been killed in the UK since 2014, strangulation was used in 550 (27%). Some 372 were strangled by an intimate partner.
The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) warns NFS can be used to control and coerce a partner by using physical strength to create fear - and studies suggest victims are seven times more likely to be murdered by their partner if there had been non-fatal strangulation beforehand.
Amanda didn't know choking could be an offence in England and Wales, even if done consensually and for pleasure. ""I had no idea,"" she says, ""but it's our business and it's our sex life - and it's not like we both haven't talked about it.""
Her boyfriend agrees: ""It's hot. We watch it on porn and so you think, 'if they do it and it works, why not us?' I might be more careful now though.""
However, Harriet Smailes, from the IFAS, says there is ""no safe way to strangle"".
""We also know that consent for these acts is not always sought in advance, and an individual's ability to provide ongoing consent can be impeded by being strangled.""
Kama Melly KC, who specialises in prosecuting sexual offence cases, says NFS often occurs as an act of domestic violence, and can be difficult to prove due to a lack of visible injuries, eye witnesses, CCTV or forensic findings.
""The fact that there can be a loss of consciousness after just a few seconds - that means the victim doesn't have a very clear narrative of events,"" she adds.
Ms Melly says defendants can claim strangulation during sex was consensual, although such a defence is not possible if the victim suffers serious harm.
Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the NPCC's lead for domestic abuse, wants people to think twice before engaging in sexual asphyxiation.
""I would say get yourself informed and really understand, because you're not a medical expert,"" she says. ""You may feel that you're doing something that's safe, but all the research and evidence would suggest it's not.
""It's incredibly dangerous, so think through the consequences.""

BBC News","An arrest warrant has been issued for a senior member of Lighthouse, the life-coaching group which was the subject of the BBC podcast series, A Very British Cult.
The warrant was issued for Shaun Cooper, a director of the group's business entity Lighthouse International Group Holdings Trading LLP, for failing to attend court.
Cooper is the first senior member of the group that the authorities have taken this kind of action against.
Lighthouse began as a life coaching organisation founded by a man called Paul Waugh. But a BBC investigation exposed it as an organisation that ruined the lives of its members and tried to silence any critics.
In the two years since the BBC published its investigation, several people have left the group and are rebuilding their lives. But a small, committed group of members - now calling themselves Lighthouse Global Media - remain devoted to Paul Waugh. They deny that Lighthouse is a cult.
Following a separate investigation into Lighthouse conducted by the Insolvency Service, the High Court in London shut down the business entity ""in the public interest"" in March 2023, on the grounds that it had filed false or misleading accounts and not cooperated with the investigation.
The Insolvency Service investigation established that, between August 2014 and July 2022, the group received more than £2.4m income - even though it had not declared any assets or income.
Since then, the High Court has requested that all four company directors – Paul Waugh, Chris Nash, Shaun Cooper and Warren Vaughan – cooperate with the Official Receiver's ongoing efforts to identify any assets to pay those owed money by Lighthouse.
Paul Waugh, the leader, moved to South Africa shortly after the company was shut down, along with Chris Nash. Both Waugh and Nash have failed to comply with a November 2024 court order to turn over Lighthouse's financial records. According to Lighthouse's letters to the court, this is because both are suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
According to Daniel Curthoys, in court for the Official Receiver, Shaun Cooper had also failed to turn up for any of the numerous interviews arranged by investigators.
At a hearing on the 25 February 2025, the court was told, in a letter from Cooper's Lighthouse colleagues, that he was suffering from depression and anxiety, and had left the country. The letter was accompanied by heavily-redacted medical notes.
Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Sebastian Prentis said Lighthouse's letter was ""a very long way short"" of explaining why Cooper had failed to appear or provide any information to the two-year investigation into Lighthouse.
Granting the application for an arrest warrant, he noted that despite the claims made in Lighthouse's letter, Cooper was apparently well enough to leave Britain. Cooper's whereabouts are currently unknown.
Of the four former directors, only Warren Vaughan has so far cooperated. At an earlier court hearing, he told the investigators he had left Lighthouse.
In response to the investigation by the Insolvency Service, Lighthouse set up a website criticising the service, accusing it of ""bullying"" the group.
The site says that ""Lighthouse refuses to comply with the Insolvency Service's demands, beyond the bear [sic] minimum necessary, on the basis that any 'investigation' has been falsely triggered by malicious and vindictive individuals and is thereby corrupt and invalid.""",UK

BBC News","Are we turning into a nation of shoplifters? That's the question Stacey Dooley asks in her latest documentary.
The presenter reveals she herself shoplifted as a teenager, as part of the BBC programme on the rise in retail theft in the UK.
Dooley explains she would steal eyeliner and mascara at around 13 or 14 years old.
""It would have been disingenuous not to mention it"" in the documentary, she says.
""There's not a world where I could sit here and try and justify it, you know, there was no reason, there was no need for me to be out there behaving like that.""
She adds that she ""wasn't thinking about the girls on the shop floor"" and ""wasn't thinking about anybody else other than myself"".
The documentary-maker spent eight months looking into the rise in shoplifting in the UK - and says ""shoplifting has never been more prolific than it is now"".
And this comes as retail theft and violence and abuse towards shop workers is rising, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).
Based on the latest weighted BRC-Opinium survey with 2,000 participants, the BRC estimates almost a quarter (24%) of the UK population witnessed shoplifting in the 12 months to February 2025.
In Meet the Shoplifters, Dooley asks shoplifters about their motivations. Some see it as an act of defiance against big corporations, while others say they find it ""really degrading"" but do it to get things like nappies and milk for their children.
One shoplifter Dooley spoke to, for example, was a mother stealing milk and bread to feed her child. ""She was riddled with guilt,"" Dooley says of the mother. ""It was out of sheer desperation.""
Tom Holder from the BRC says shoplifting in the UK is becoming worse and worse, adding: ""We're now just reaching new heights. People think that they can get away with it, without consequence.""
The recent BRC survey also estimates 23% of customers witnessed the physical or verbal abuse of shop staff in the year to February 2025. This can include racial or sexual abuse, physical assault or threats with weapons.
Dooley spoke to retail worker Dips, who works in a cosmetics store in Manchester, and says ""as each year has gone on, it's got worse for us"".
""It's not a victimless crime. Somebody always pays the price for it down the line. And for us, it's the staff in here,"" she adds.
Dooley also explains how shoplifting is being documented on social media. ""We've seen shop assistants be, you know, verbally abused, physically abused,"" she says.
Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, adds that while an incident can be ""over in a matter of seconds"", it can have ""life-long consequences"" on those who experience it, making them think twice about visiting their local high streets.
When speaking to shoplifters, Dooley says some of them ""don't even see it as a crime, necessarily"".
And she adds that on social media, some people use hashtags to offer other shoplifters advice.
But shoplifting cost UK retailers £2bn in one year, according to a recent estimate.
And Holder says shoplifting puts pressure on retail prices, adding: ""That money has to come from somewhere, so it ends up being spread across everything that we buy.""",UK
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x4d00e0j4o,Fishing boat cocaine smugglers guilty,2025-03-12T16:41:01.517Z,,"Four men arrested at sea as they tried to smuggle cocaine with an estimated street value of about £100m into the UK on a fishing boat have been convicted.
The men were found with more than a tonne of the drug on board the Lily Lola, off the coast of Newquay, Cornwall, in September last year.
Michael Kelly and Jake Marchant pleaded guilty before trial, with a jury also finding Jon Williams and Patrick Godfrey guilty at Truro Crown Court on Wednesday.
All four were convicted of conspiring to smuggle a tonne of cocaine.
Prosecutor Frederick Hookway told the court the fishing boat was intercepted shortly after 14:00 BST on 13 September by a Border Force vessel with Williams at the helm, Marchant next to him, Kelly in the accommodation area and Godrey asleep in a chair on the deck.
Mr Hookway said searches revealed blocks and bales of drugs stashed all over the vessel, which had been bought by Williams a few months earlier from a man in Ramsgate, Kent, for £116,000.
Kelly, 45, of Portway, Manchester; Marchant, 26, of no fixed abode; Williams, 45, of St Thomas, Swansea; and Godfrey, 31, of Port Tennant, Swansea, are due to return to court on 8 May to be sentenced.
Judge James Adkin told them: ""You should expect long custodial sentences.""
National Crime Agency branch commander Derek Evans said the operation had ""prevented a huge haul of cocaine from hitting the streets of the UK and wider Europe.
He said it ""would have blighted countless lives and communities"".
He added the drug supply chain had been ""disrupted"" and law enforcement had ""ensured organised criminals are deprived of the significant profits they would have gained had these drugs made it into the country.""

BBC News, West of England","The world's 100 most populated cities are becoming increasingly exposed to flooding and drought, according to new research.
Charity WaterAid worked with the University of Bristol and Cardiff University on a study using data on climate hazards.
The research found that 17% of the cities studied were at risk from ""climate whiplash"" where drought and flooding has become more intense.
Prof Katerina Michaelides, lead scientist from the University of Bristol, said: ""The findings from our study illustrate just how differently and dramatically climate change is expressing around the globe – there is no one-size-fits-all.""
The study compared each city's social and water infrastructure vulnerabilities – such as poverty and waste systems – alongside more than 40 years worth of data on climate hazards.
Researchers then aimed to identify which cities could be the most vulnerable to extreme climate changes and the least equipped to handle them.
The study also showed that 20% of the 100 cities had seen a change, at one time experiencing one extreme, now facing another.
In the last four decades, their research showed that cities including London, Madrid and Paris had become increasingly dry, while in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, and Lahore in Pakistan, they are now having more severe floods.
Prof Michaelides said the data could help city leaders make decisions.
""A deeper understanding of localised climate hazards can support more intelligent and bespoke planning in major cities,"" she added.
Cities in Africa and Asia are most at risk of climate shifts which can impact clean water supplies, according to the study.
WaterAid said the report had come at a time when major nations had been reducing or rediverting international aid funds.
Tim Wainwright, WaterAid UK's chief executive said: ""We're seeing a sweep of global aid cuts, which could leave basic human rights hanging in the balance.
""Floods and droughts are stripping away people's foundation of survival – water.
""Communities can recover from disaster, stay healthy and be ready for whatever the future holds. It all starts with clean water.""

Reporting from the Old Bailey","Constance Marten's lawyer has said the death of her newborn baby was a ""tragic accident"" caused by her ""falling asleep and compromising her baby's breathing"".
In his opening speech to the jury during a retrial at the Old Bailey, Francis FitzGibbon KC said that Marten was ""consumed by grief"" and ""reduced to scavenging for food"" after her baby died.
Marten, 37, and Mark Gordon, 50, deny gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of their baby.
Last year they were found guilty of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice.
The remains of their baby were found in a bag for life in a shed in a Brighton suburb in March 2023.
John Femi-Ola KC, barrister for Mr Gordon, told the jury in his opening statement that baby Victoria was ""well cared-for, well loved, and kept warm and close to her mother"", and added it was disputed that their baby ""was ever carried in a bag for life whilst she was living"".
Mr Fitzgibbon KC said the baby was born in a rented cottage in Cumbia on Christmas Eve 2022.
He added that the couple then went on the run because they did not want their baby to be taken from them as their previous four children had been.
""They went temporarily into hiding to avoid unwanted attention while deciding what to do"", he said.
""Ms Marten,"" he said, ""exhausted, fell asleep over her baby after breastfeeding... and the consequence was the baby could not breathe and died"".
He added: ""What happened was no crime, but a terrible tragic accident.""
The jury has been told that pathologists said the cause of death was not yet known.
For the prosecution, Tom Little KC earlier told the court that the couple had been ""warned that it was inappropriate to live in a tent without access to proper warmth"".
He told jurors that the conditions the defendants were living in were ""utterly reckless"" and dangerous.
""What took place on the South Downs was done in the teeth of warnings by social workers and the courts,"" he said, ""and at a time when the defendants knew that their other children - four of them - had been removed from their care"".
The jury was also told that Marten had previously been warned of the risks of staying in a tent with a newborn baby by social workers.
Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, a social worker who had contact with Marten and Gordon when their first baby was born said their case was ""very memorable"".
She told jurors that on one occasion she accompanied Marten to a tent where she and Gordon had been staying while she was pregnant.
Marten had just given birth to the first of the couple's other children. Asked what the tent was like, the witness said: ""It was what I would describe as a festival tent, very small, green in colour… bowing on the top.""
Mr FitzGibbon asked the social worker whether Marten had said that she intended to live in the tent with the baby.
""No she didn't say that, because she felt she could claim social housing,"" the social worker replied.
The social worker was shown notes from the local authority computer system that she had made at the time.
These record that Marten ""was on first name terms with her bank manager"" and had said that her trust fund had been stopped and she had no money she could access.
Marten and Gordon have denied manslaughter and a second charge of causing or allowing the death of a child between 4 January and 27 February 2023.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gn9zqkp9o,Sentencing body defends changes after 'two-tier' row,2025-03-10T20:43:21.316Z,"Dominic Casciani
Home and Legal Correspondent•@BBCDomC","The body advising judges on criminal sentences has hit back at the justice secretary's call for it to scrap new guidance on sentencing offenders from ethnic monitories.
The Sentencing Council said ministers from both major parties or their representatives had known about the plans since 2022 and did not object.
It comes after Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood last week wrote to the council urging it to rethink guidance directing judges to review the lives of offenders from ethnic minority and other backgrounds before deciding on a punishment.
Opposition politicians had claimed the changes amounted to a ""two-tier justice"" system.
Lord Justice William Davis, the chairman of the council, said that Mahmood's officials were fully briefed on the plans that had been three years in the making.
He said that ministers could not ""dictate"" sentencing and he would have to take legal advice on Mahmood's powers over the council's work.
This raises the bizarre possibility that the body advising judges on how to judge might decide to go to court for a ruling on whether the minister overseeing justice has any power to tell judges what to do.
The row was triggered after the Sentencing Council, which advises judges and magistrates on the complexities of prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance for England and Wales on when a court should order a pre-sentence report into an offender's life.
These reports do not tie the hands of judges but they often provide the court with a detailed insight into why an individual fell into crime, their risk of reoffending and the chances for rehabilitation outside of jail.
The new guidelines told judges to order a pre-sentence report if the offender is from a minority background, facing the possibility of jail for the first time, a woman or pregnant.
It also urged them to always consider a report in a wider range of circumstances, including where an offender has an addiction, is transgender, or has learning difficulties.
Writing to the Sentencing Council last week, Mahmood said she objected to the new guideline, saying: ""As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law.""
That came after the shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick described the plan as ""two-tier"" justice that would disadvantage white offenders.
But in a six-page letter to Mahmood, the Sentencing Council chair said the new guidance aimed to correct disparities and had been drawn up after long discussions over how particular types of offenders were being treated differently to others.
Lord Justice Davis said that people from ethnic minorities were receiving longer sentences and the aim was to ensure that punishments were more consistent, regardless of background.
He said Conservative and Labour ministers, as well as their their officials, had at least 15 opportunities over three years to object to the plan
""I have seen it suggested that the guideline instructs sentencers to impose a more lenient sentence on those from ethnic minorities than white offenders,"" he said. ""Plainly that suggestion is completely wrong.""
The senior judge said ministerial representative had been at all 15 meetings where the changes was discussed between July 2022 and January 2025.
The public consultation on the plans had set out the proposals and Conservative ministers, then in power, had welcomed the ""fuller guidance"".
""No concern was expressed about the term now under debate,"" said Lord Justice Davis.
Only eight of 150 responses to the public consultation had objected to the explicit reference to ethnic minorities.
The judge said: ""At no stage did the Lord Chancellor's representative express any concern or reservation about the term now under debate.
""The walk-through of the guideline with officials from the Ministry of Justice took place on Monday 3 March. Again no concern was expressed about the relevant term.""
While ministers have an exceptional power to intervene in the Sentencing Council's decisions, this has never been used in a situation where new guidance had been published and the government had already been extensively consulted and had not objected.
""I shall have to take legal advice as to whether the power... applies in those circumstances,"" said the judge.
He continued: ""I do not accept the premise of your objection to the relevant part of the list of cohorts for whom a pre-sentence report will normally be considered necessary.
""In criminal proceedings where the offender is the subject of prosecution by the state, the state should not determine the sentence imposed on an individual offender.
""If sentencing guidelines of whatever kind were to be dictated in any way by Ministers of the Crown, this principle would be breached.""",UK

News correspondent","A young baby girl would still be alive today if it were not for the ""reckless and ultimately grossly negligent conduct"" of her parents, a jury has heard.
Constance Marten, 37, and Mark Gordon, 50, deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child.
They are facing a retrial at the Old Bailey. The couple's baby was found dead in a shopping bag covered in rubbish in 2023.
Opening the case, prosecutor Tom Little KC said Gordon and Marten ""put their relationship and their views of life before the life of a little baby girl"".
""Their desire to keep their baby girl led inexorably to the death of that very baby,"" he said.
During the previous trial, Marten and Gordon were found guilty of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice.
On Monday, jurors were told they spent weeks living in a tent to avoid detection by authorities.
The retrial heard the couple, who have been in a relationship since 2016, have four other children who were all taken into care.
Mr Little told jurors that the couple gave birth in ""secret"".
The barrister said they then decided in the middle of winter and in ""obviously dangerous weather conditions they would deprive the baby of what it needed – warmth, shelter, protection and food and ultimately safety"".
He added that anyone who has had a baby knows that they must be kept warm and their temperature should not fall below 16C.
By the time the defendants were found they had been living in a thin tent for more than a month, and were ""scavenging"" for food by taking it from bins and breaking into properties, Mr Little told jurors.
When they were found, both defendants smelled ""very unpleasant"" as if they had not washed for weeks, he added.
Jurors were told the defendants were spotted on CCTV in Newhaven - around nine miles away from Brighton, where they were arrested - on 8 January 2023.
In footage captured a short time later, it ""absolutely chucks it down"", the court was told, and prosecutors said the defendants and baby would have been left ""sopping wet"".
The prosecutor also said Marten had been willing to lie to get what she wanted, claiming she was from the travelling community and had been brought up in a caravan when she went to hospital during her labour with an older child in 2017.
He told the court that she had, in fact, been raised with ""a silver spoon"", describing her as a ""trust fund child"".
Mr Little said the couple did not seek any medical assistance for their child before, during or after birth, adding that on some occasions the baby was transferred to a reinforced reusable Lidl bag.
When the hunt by the authorities to find them intensified ""so their desperation increased and so did the risks and the dangers to the baby"", the prosecutor said.
Mr Little told the court Marten had previously been warned by a social worker about the dangers of living in a tent with a baby, having done so when one of her older children was born.
Marten appeared in the dock for the first day of her retrial. Gordon was not at court.
Judge Mark Lucraft KC told the jury that it was hoped that Gordon would join them on video link, adding ""the fact he is not here does not mean anything to you at all"".
The jury heard that at the end of 2022, the couple had moved around various locations in South Yorkshire, Bolton, Essex, London and the South Coast of England, and they stayed in various properties including a holiday cottage in Northumberland, a hotel in Cheshire, and another hotel in Manchester.
The court also heard that a car the defendants used had broken down, prompting them to switch to a new car, which later caught fire on the M61 between junctions three and four in Greater Manchester.
""They didn't remain at the scene with their towering inferno vehicle,"" said Mr Little.
Police found a number of ""burner"" phones in the car, Marten's passport, a placenta wrapped in the towel, and a large amount of baby items including newborn clothing, suggesting the baby was already born by then.
After abandoning the burning vehicle, the couple then walked in the rain along the banked wooded area beside the motorway for about 200m and were given a lift by a member of the public to a Morrisons supermarket close to the Bolton Interchange Station, where they were caught on CCTV footage shown to the jury.
The couple first came to public attention in January 2023 when police launched a very public manhunt after evidence of a recent birth was found in a burnt-out car near Bolton.
The couple were eventually found in Brighton on 27 February but there was no sign of the baby.
The jury was told the defendants refused to answer questions after their arrest, including about the whereabouts of the baby.
The newborn - who they called Victoria - was found dead two days later in a shopping bag in an allotment in the Hollingbury area of Brighton.

BBC News, Guernsey","England rugby stars have said they were ""blown away"" by the response to a coaching session they ran in Guernsey.
Red Roses captain Marlie Packer and her team-mate Rosie Galligan visited the Guernsey Girls' Rugby Academy in Footes Lane, St Peter Port, on Sunday to train some young players.
Galligan said the pair enjoyed the day with Packer, who was part of the England team that won the Women's Rugby World Cup in 2014, adding they hoped it could inspire more girls to play the sport.
The event was organised through Ben Rowe, who is Galligan's uncle, and he said he was ""chuffed to bits"" to get his niece and Packer down to the academy.
Dozens of girls were put through their paces by the England duo, who are preparing for their opening 2025 Women's Six Nations game against Italy on 23 March.
Packer and Galligan gave the girls tips on passing, tackling and other techniques from the sport before holding a question and answer session.
Packer, who also played in the 2017 and 2021 World Cup finals, said it felt ""special"" to be able to coach the young players.
The flanker said: ""Me doing my bit and Rosie as well coming here hopefully will inspire those girls to pick up a ball.""
Galligan said when she was young there were only a few girls who played the sport at youth level, so having so many turn up for the training session felt inspirational.
""It still kind of blows you away when you do go down and get 40 or 50 girls turning up,"" the second row forward said.
""We're definitely paving the way for the younger generation.""
Mr Rowe, who is a girls' coach at the academy, said it was brilliant for all involved to have his niece and Packer coach the girls.
He said: ""We're chuffed to bits - the girls have all got smiles on their faces.

It is the first time a dog from Italy has won best in show, which comes with a trophy and small cash prize of reportedly £200.
Miuccia, who is owned by Enrico De Gaspari, was the winner of the hound group earlier in the show, and beat the winners of six other groups to win the top prize.
""I absolutely adore her,"" said handler Mr Liguori. ""She is the sweetest dog.
""She always wants to be super close to me and that's the most important thing.""
Mr Liguori said it was ""incredible, it's amazing"" to be the first dog from Italy to be crowned best in show.
""As Italians we are super proud and means that we are doing a fantastic job.""
Helen Kerfoot, Crufts show manager, said it was ""fantastic"" to watch Miuccia and her handler's ""strong relationship together in the ring, and they are truly deserving winners"".
""Well done to all of our other wonderful finalists too.
""The dogs, their owners, and handlers should be incredibly proud to have taken part in such a momentous final - it's an incredible achievement, one we are sure they'll treasure for years to come.""
The runner-up was Viking, a Tibetan mastiff from Romania.",UK

Lead weather presenter","The UK's warmest days of the year arrived this weekend, with temperatures reaching almost 20C in parts of the country.
Temperatures topped 19.7C in Crosby near Liverpool and 18.7C in Harwarden in north Wales, while Killowen in Northern Ireland saw 17.2C and Threave in western Scotland recorded 17.3C.
The warm weather has seen some spots in the UK hotter than popular European holiday destinations, including Spain's Balearic islands and the Costa del Sol.
But BBC Weather forecasts that temperatures will drop next week, with cold air expected to come from the north.
On Saturday, temperatures topped 19.1C in Bridgefoot, England. Scotland recorded a high of 18.3C in Threave, while Northern Ireland hit 17C in Castlederg.
Wales matched Thursday's recording of 18.2C with Saturday's temperature in Porthmadog.
Holiday hotspots such as Marbella in Spain or Italy's Amalfi Coast - known for their sunny climates - recorded lower temperatures than in the warmest parts of the UK.
According to the Met Office, Marbella on Spain's south coast had a high of 15C on Saturday, Ibiza had a high of 17C, and Sorrento on the Amalfi Coast reached 14C.
Temperatures this weekend are around five to eight degrees above average - more typical of May than March, when temperatures are normally around 8C to 11C across the UK.
The warmer-than-average weather is a result of a south-easterly wind bringing air from continental Europe.
But the nicer weather is not expected to last, nor has the UK turned a corner toward summer.
Spring can often bring big swings in temperature and can sometimes even bring 'all four seasons in a day'.
From Monday, the weather will switch to a northerly wind bringing a return of colder arctic air. Initially temperatures will drop in Scotland, with highs of only 4C to 8C.
Then from Tuesday and the rest of the week, the colder air oozes south to all parts, bringing temperatures around two or three degrees below average.
There is also the possibility of a bit of snow over higher ground and wintry showers elsewhere.
Thursday was previously the warmest day of the year so far in England, Wales and Scotland with 19C recorded in Santon Downham in Suffolk and 18.2C in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion.
The Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh reached 16.8C which is the highest on record for it this early in the year.
In the meantime, make the most of the warmth this weekend and check the forecast for your local area on the BBC Weather website and app.

BBC News NI","A chiffon dress worn by the late Queen Elizabeth and a ball gown worn by her sister Princess Margaret are among the regalia going on display in County Down.
The fitting backdrop of Hillsborough Castle, itself a royal residence, is hosting an exhibition that gives an intimate glimpse into the world of the royal fashion designers.
The castle, which has been at the heart of many political and diplomatic encounters, will be transformed into regal elegance to feature garments created for many high-profile members of the Royal Family.
As well as Queen Elizabeth II and her sister, other outfits are on show including those worn by the Queen Mother and sketches for dresses to be worn by the late Diana, Princess of Wales.
Running from 15 March 2025 - 4 January 2026, the exhibition - Royal Style in the Making - tells the story of the working relationship between fashion designer and royal client.
""Visitors will gain an intimate perspective on the design process, from initial sketches to finished garment, that helped define the visual identity of the Royal Family over the past century,"" curator Claudia Acott Williams said.
""Royal and ceremonial dress is very different from fashion, it's not the same as designing fashionable gowns, royal dress is an incredibly performative mode of dress.
""It's designed to tell a story, to create moments of pageantry and spectacle.""
Historic Royal Palaces hope the exhibition will give visitors a sneak peak behind the scenes of the work of five of the 20th Century's most important royal couturiers: Madame Handley-Seymour, Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, Oliver Messel and David Sassoon.
On display is a full-sized working pattern for a completed gown which would be worn by Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) at the coronation of King George VI in 1937 at Westminster Abbey.
Known as toile, it is a preparatory garment, by court dressmaker Madame Handley-Seymour, that is cut to the body in a series of fittings.
Ms Acott Williams explained that ""it's like a 3D sketch"".
""This is a really extraordinary insight into how such a garment is created and the fitting process as this would have been fitted to the Queen's body,"" she said.
Visible on the garment are little tacking threads that Madame Handley-Seymour would have used in the cutting and fitting process, as well as patches of embroidery that have been added during the design process.
Madame Handley-Seymour was the favourite designer of Queen Mary of Teck and was recommended to her daughter-in-law, the future Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother).
""As a young woman marrying into the Royal Family she did the appropriate thing and wore the designer that her mother-in-law advised, and she designed her wedding dress in 1923 and then her coronation dress in 1937,"" Ms Acott Williams explained.
Sketches for the Queen Mother by Norman Hartnell are also on display.
Norman Hartnell would go on to design both the wedding and coronation dresses for Queen Elizabeth II.
""I think that personal relationship was absolutely critical, we know that the Queen Mother and Norman Hartnell had a wonderful relationship, they were very close,"" Ms Acott Williams added.
Letters from Queen Elizabeth II to Norman Hartnell are displayed as part of the exhibition showing the direct line of communication between the royal women and designers.
Similarly with Princess Diana, sketches by David Sassoon are on display with her handwritten notes, such little ticks and ""this in dark blue please"".
""There is a very personal relationship between them, they would have long fittings at Kensington Palace sat on the floor with fabric samples all over the place.""
A salmon-pink silk chiffon dress with bat-wing sleeves, worn by Queen Elizabeth II and created by her royal dressmaker, Hardy Amies, is also on display.
She wore it as part of her state visit to Bahrain in 1979 and also to a film premier in London a few months later.
""Hardy Aimes is quite important in ushering her [Queen Elizabeth II] look forward, a slightly more youthful modernity, particularly around bright colours that she was so often seen wearing in later years,"" Ms Acott Williams explained.
""The 70s is a moment of great political and social change and there is a real impetus within the Royal Family to be seen to reflect the times.
""I think she [Queen Elizabeth II] does start to make bolder choices in the 1970s and Hardy Aimes is quite an important person in helping shepherd her through that.""
An 18th Century-style blue and gold ball gown worn by Princess Margaret to a charity event at London's Mansion House in July 1964 is another highlight of the exhibition.
It was was designed by Oliver Messel who was one of the leading designers for stage and screen, and the uncle of Princess Margaret's then husband - Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon.
""Margaret actually sees his [Oliver Messel's] production of A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1938 when she's less than 10-years-old and she's totally mesmerised by it, and then several years later she marries his nephew and they become incredibly close, and even beyond her divorce they remain great friends,"" Ms Acott Williams explained.
""I hope this exhibition shows the thought, research, craftsmanship that goes into these gowns. They are created by the greatest crafts-people that Britain has to offer.
""We are all familiar with these women and with what they wear but what we wanted to understand more about the people who were dressing them and about how those relationships worked,"" Ms Acott Williams added.",UK

BBC News","A migrant has died during an attempt to cross the Channel in a small boat from northern France to England, French maritime authorities have said.
The Kuwaiti national, in his sixties, suffered a cardiac arrest on the boat that was carrying him and other migrants on Saturday, the Pas-de-Calais prefecture said.
The boat returned to the beach but despite the efforts of police and medics the man was declared dead at the scene, it added.
He is the sixth person to have died while attempting to cross the Channel this year.
The boat set off from Calais in northern France on Saturday morning and ""very quickly returned to the beach with a person in cardio-respiratory arrest on board"", the French maritime prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea told AFP news agency.
""This boat set off again once it had dropped off the people who wanted to disembark on the beach,"" it added.
Authorities said the boat was ""quite heavily loaded"" but did not say how many people were on board.
Home Office figures show that more than 1,600 migrants have crossed the Channel in small boats in the past week, with 51 people arriving on Friday alone.
At least 3,720 people have made the crossing to date this year, an increase of 11% on the same period last year.
A record number of migrants died while attempting to make the dangerous crossing in 2024.
According to the Office for the Fight against Illicit Trafficking of Migrants, 78 people died while trying to reach England aboard small boats last year, the highest number since the first crossing in 2018.
The UK and France have ramped up efforts to stop Channel crossings, including intensifying patrols on French beaches, intercepting small boats and apprehending the smugglers who organise the crossings.
In a statement on Friday, the Home Office said: ""We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security.
""The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay. We will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice.""
On 27 February, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper met her French counterpart, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, to agree a raft of measures aimed at tackling people-smuggling gangs.
These include a new specialist intelligence and judicial police unit in Dunkirk to speed up the arrest and prosecution of people-smugglers and training drone pilots to help intercept boats before they reach the sea.
French authorities will stop migrants on land but not once they take to the sea.",UK

Royal correspondent","King Charles is to call for unity and building bridges in what he describes as ""these uncertain times"" of international tension, in a message to mark Commonwealth Day next week.
In the annual message to mark the day on Monday, the King will emphasise the value of nations coming together in a ""spirit of support, and crucially, friendship"".
The King has become involved in the diplomatic negotiations involving the UK, the US and Ukraine - with the monarch warmly welcoming President Volodymyr Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader's disastrous meeting with US President Donald Trump and with a state visit planned for Trump.
A Commonwealth country, Canada, also faces its own tensions with Trump's administration, as he has called for Canada to become the US 51st state.
Commonwealth Day is traditionally marked with a service at Westminster Abbey and this year the King and Queen will attend alongside the Prince and Princess of Wales.
In his written message, which will be published in full on Monday, the King will say: ""In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship.""
It is a message that he has made before - that the diversity of peoples and cultures is a strength and not a weakness.
But it is a message now against a backdrop of global tensions, as the US pushes for an end to the war that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
As well as a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian President Zelensky, the King this week held a meeting with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, a Commonwealth leader who has faced pressure from the US.
King Charles is Canada's head of state and ahead of the meeting Trudeau said: ""Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation.""
The King used the Commonwealth, with its 56-member nations, as an example of co-operation between countries.
""The Commonwealth's ability to bring together people from all over the world has stood the test of time and remains as ever-important today,"" says the King's message.
The service at Westminster Abbey on Monday will emphasise the multicultural diversity of the Commonwealth, with the royal guests being met by a pipe band from a Hindu eco-temple in north-west London.
There will be music from an African arts group, the Masai Cultural Arts team.
And singer Joan Armatrading will perform a version of her song, Love and Affection.
An innovation for this year's Commonwealth Day has been that the King has prepared his own personal playlist of favourite music tracks, by artists including Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue and Raye.

BBC News","A former national security adviser has warned the potential deployment of UK troops to protect peace in Ukraine could last for ""many years"".
Lord Sedwill told the BBC's The Week in Westminster that the UK would need to be ""willing to display strategic patience to give the Ukrainians the [security] assurances they need"" in the event of a peace deal.
Both the UK and France have said they would be willing to send troops to work to uphold any ceasefire in Russia's war with Ukraine.
They would form part of a ""coalition of the willing"" to help Kyiv which the UK said could involve around 20 other countries. Not all would necessarily send troops but could provide other support.
The plan, spearheaded by the UK and France, was set out at a summit hosted by the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer last weekend.
No information was provided on which countries had shown an interest in offering support or what that support could specifically involve, but the group is believed to consist of European and Commonwealth countries.
Downing Street said that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese committed to ""consider contributing"" to the coalition in a phone call on Saturday with Sir Keir.
Norway's foreign minister Espen Barth Eide said the country would be ""happy to contribute in one way or the other"", but was not yet able to commit to specific support.
In an interview on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, he said: ""I think we should not put the cart before the horse, because we need to make sure that we define what is there to defend, whether it will be a peace agreement.""
Asked whether the country would consider sending troops to Ukraine, he said: ""I don't think many countries have actually [decided] about what exactly we will do in practice, because we need to know what is it that is there to be secured first.""
Lord Sedwill said if Russia believed it could just ""wait us out"" while UK troops were deployed in Ukraine, then any effort to protect a peace deal would not succeed.
""So we have to be willing to sustain such an effort for potentially quite a long period, could be many years,"" he added.
It comes as concerns mount over US President Donald Trump's approach to the conflict, after he paused military aid to Ukraine, as well as intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery in an apparent bid to bring Ukraine's President Zelensky to the negotiating table.
Russian officials have rejected the idea of peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, with foreign minister Sergei Lavrov previously saying such a move ""can't be allowed"" as it would amount to the ""direct, official and unveiled involvement of Nato members in the war against Russia"".
On Friday, Russian MP and TV presenter Yevgeny Popov told BBC Newsnight that the prospect of UK soldiers in Ukraine was ""unacceptable"" and warned that ""British troops will be direct targets for our missiles, you will get coffins in return"".
In recent weeks, European leaders have committed to bolstering defence and increase military spending.
At a summit in Brussels on Thursday, EU leaders backed plans to jointly borrow €150bn to lend to EU governments to boost military capabilities.
Sir Keir welcomed the ""historic"" move as ""another sign of Europe stepping up"".
A meeting set to take place in Paris next week would be an ""important moment to drive forward planning"", Downing Street said.
The UK also said it would work with French President Emmanuel Macron, alongside President Zelensky, to draw up a peace plan to present to Trump.
Lord Sedwill, who was cabinet secretary under Theresa May and Boris Johnson, said it was a moment ""for a reset"" of Nato with European nations showing that they are ""willing to step up and share the burden"".
He added that Nato ""is in pretty good health"", particularly with the recent addition of Finland and Sweden, ""two really significant military powers"".
Rose Gottemoeller, deputy secretary general of Nato during Trump's first term, said she was ""admiring"" of Europe's recent response in supporting Kyiv.
""They are really taking a lot of responsibility for moving forward in their own defence as well as the defence of Ukraine,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.
If Europe can step up, Lord Sedwill added, ""then we can convince the Americans that this remains an institution which actually helps protect their security as well as European security and thus to remain invested in it"".
Former Conservative defence secretary Ben Wallace said that it would not be ""the end of the world"" if the US pulled out of Nato and that Europe should be looking at how it can replace satellite imagery and other technology pulled from Ukraine by the US.
""We have the will in Europe and the money if we choose to fix our own security and defence,"" he told the Today programme.
Many Western leaders have said that it would only be possible to uphold a lasting peace in Ukraine with the help of the US.
Sir Keir previously said that a plan for defence should be made ""in conjunction with the United States... it's that ability to work with the United States and our European partners that has kept the peace for 80 years now"".
Trump has so far avoided committing to such support, and has suggested that the presence of US workers in Ukraine as part of a potential minerals deal could act as a security guarantee.",UK

Gemma Kemble-Stephenson signed up at the age of 17 and served as a medic in the Royal Army Medical Corps for 18 years.
After suffering a spinal injury in 2018, she found taking part in adaptive sports through the Help the Heroes charity was a big part of her recovery and the difficult transition to civilian life.
She now works for the charity and is leading its first female-only series of sports taster sessions in Liverpool this weekend to ""celebrate strong women"" who have served.
The event, at Liverpool John Moores University, is part of the charity's drive to encourage more female veterans to get active.
It will offer a number of adaptive sports taster sessions including netball, yoga, power-lifting, boccia, and rowing.
The charity said Kemble-Stephenson, the current World's Strongest Disabled Woman and a para powerlifter and indoor rower, was an inspiration to other women looking to reignite their passion for sport.
Kemble-Stephenson, from Neath, Wales, said: ""We know the power of sport to your mental and physical wellbeing.
""Many women join the armed forces because they enjoy being active... but when they leave that outlet can be taken away from them.""
She said it would be a ""safe space"" for women ""to dip their toe back in the water and try out a range of different sports"".
""They will be able to connect with like-minded people, too,"" she added.
The 43-year-old said women are set to travel from all over the country to take part, adding that when the weekend was over they would ""go home feeling positive and energised"".
The charity has a programme of sports and social activities for former service personnel as part of its recovery programme.
The community sports series was launched three years ago but the charity hopes this latest event is the first of many held exclusively for women.
Kemble-Stephenson added: ""The majority of people take part just for the fun, but we have had some people go on to complete our coaching academy course and represent their country at Invictus Games, Paralympics and Commonwealth competitions.""

Michael Keane, 38, began to verbally abuse his partner one month into their relationship before carrying out a campaign of physical abuse that lasted six months.
Douglas Courthouse heard at one point he placed a mattress against the front door of her flat to make it difficult for her to leave.
Passing sentence, Deemster Graeme Cook said he had subjected the ""vulnerable"" woman to ""appalling"" and ""degrading"" treatment.
The court heard the couple had met in October 2023 on a night out.
While they had initially divided their time between Keane's home in Liverpool and hers on the island, he went on to move in with her.
The court was told Keane had begun verbally abusing the victim within three weeks of them meeting, and started regularly hitting her in November that year.
He would then refuse to let her leave the flat until she covered up the bruises he had given her, the court was told.
After being punched in the face by Keane on one occasion in April 2023, she ""crept out"" of the flat and called her sister, who encouraged her to report him to the police, the hearing was told.
Keane was arrested, and later broke his bail conditions by letting himself into the woman's flat without permission and sending her threatening messages.
In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said she had never imagined someone that she thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with ""could hurt me in this way"".
Keane pleaded guilty to committing domestic abuse between 1 November 2023 to 4 May 2024.
Deemster Cook said the victim was an ""extremely vulnerable young person"" who had trusted him.
The deemster imposed a restraining order forbidding Keane from contacting or approaching the victim, and an exclusion order banning him from the island for five years after his release.

Investigations correspondent
Amy Walker
BBC News","Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as ""one of the largest"" foreign intelligence operations in the UK.
Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023.
While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps.
The methods they used were the sort of thing you would ""expect to see in a spy novel"", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy.
Gaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents.
They were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.
Here police found a ""treasure trove"" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment.
They also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his ""minions"", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise.
Roussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial.
The cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018.
As part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as ""hooked and in love"" with her in WhatsApp messages.
Another operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022.
During the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was ""sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information"".
The police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity.
Met counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an ""extremely sophisticated"" operation that ""posed a threat to national security and individuals"".
Roussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard.
The Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an ""intermediary for the Russian intelligence services"".
Roussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations.
Roussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm.
Stoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname ""The Destroyer"".
Dzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on ""British values"".
But Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova – they were found in bed together when police made arrests – and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past.
During their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia.
Ivanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested. He was arrested a year after the other five defendants and told police he had several conversations with MI5.
The prosecution case focused on six operations carried out by the spies:
Operation 1
This targeted the Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev.
Marsalek and Roussev exchanged messages discussing their options in relation to Mr Grozev, including the placing of team members in seats next to him on planes. He was followed throughout Europe and properties connected to him were watched in Austria and Bulgaria.
The spy cell also discussed potentially robbing him of his laptop and phone and taking it to the Russian Embassy, burning his property, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, or killing him.
Operation 2
This targeted journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian national.
The cell followed him in various countries, and discussed kidnapping him in the UK and smuggling him out of the country using a small boat.
At one stage, Ivanova was so close to him on a plane that she could see the Pin code for his phone.
Operation 3
This targeted a man called Bergey Ryskaliyev in November 2021, the court heard.
Mr Ryskaliyev is a Kazakhstan national and former politician. He fled to the United Kingdom where he was later granted asylum.
There is and was a clear motive for Russia to develop relations with Kazakhstan, the court heard.
Prosecutors said that targeting a political dissident on behalf of Kazakhstan cultivates those relations by providing Kazakhstan with what it might consider to be assistance.
Operation 4
This involved plans for disruptive activity at the Kazakh embassy in London in September 2022.
The court heard that the plan was to stage a demonstration outside the embassy - a ""fake protest"" - to create a pretence that they were in possession of genuine intelligence about those responsible, which they would then pass on to the Kazakhstan intelligence to try to gain favour with Kazakhstan on behalf of Russia.
Operation 5
This involved surveillance at the Patch Barracks, a US Military Base in Stuttgart in late 2022.
This is a US military airbase, which jurors heard was believed by the defendants to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained in the use of surface to air weapons, at the very time of Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
Prosecutors say the defendants' plan was to target the airbase using a range of highly sophisticated technology designed to capture key intelligence about those present on the base.
Operation 6
Jurors were told this plan was targeting a man called Kirill Kachur.
He is a Russian national who spent time in Montenegro who was employed by the Investigative Committee of Russia but left the country in 2021 and was designated as a ""foreign agent"" by Russia in November 2023.",UK

One in five NHS England staff registered a nationality other than British last year, but in the North East and Cumbria it was about one in 10.
The data comes as concerns have been raised about over reliance on international workers within the NHS.
Katha Deguzman, a Filipino ward sister at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, said working in the UK had been ""incredibly fulfilling"".
The number of overseas workers in the North East and Cumbria is the lowest in the country and puts the region within the NHS long term international recruitment aim of between nine and 11% of health service staff.
Doctor and nursing roles had the highest percentage of non-British staff members in the area.
Miss Deguzman, who moved to the UK in 2018, said she was ""really worried and scared"" about coming to England to work but had since found a second family in her friendly colleagues and patients.
""It was a really friendly hospital,"" the spinal injury ward nurse said, adding: ""I felt like [the patients] would worry because I'm not from here, but I get all the trust of my patients which I'm truly grateful for.
""It's fulfilling for me, being able to extend my help to care for them.""
The region has a lower percentage of non-White British residents compared to the rest of the country.
The last census in 2021 found 90% of people in the North East and 95% of people in Cumbria were White British, compared to 81% nationally.
Despite the lower than average number of overseas employees, international workers remain significant to NHS provision in the region.
At South Tyneside And Sunderland NHS Trust, 18% are non-British, the highest number in the region.
The North East and Cumbria Integrated Care Board had the lowest number at 2%, while at the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 11% of staff are non-British.
Debi McKeown, the nursing workforce lead at James Cook, said understanding local dialect could at times be tricky for new recruits but the high level of clinical skills was key in ""sustaining a really healthy workforce"".
She said: ""We absolutely had a gap in our workforce here and being able to bring in international nurses has enhanced what we can provide to patients.
""Overseas nurses were really crucial to help us provide safe care to patients.""

Royal correspondent, BBC News","King Charles III is launching a personal playlist of music that lifts his spirits and brings back important memories, including Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue and Grace Jones.
He was photographed at Buckingham Palace for the music project, named the King's Music Room, with an ""on air"" sign on the desk of the royal DJ.
A video trailer shows the band for the changing of the guard outside the palace playing Bob Marley's Could You Be Loved, in a project to celebrate music from Commonwealth countries.
""So this is what I particularly wanted to share - songs which have brought me joy,"" the King said.
""Throughout my life, music has meant a great deal to me,"" the King says in the video launching the project, which is a partnership with Apple Music.
""I know that is also the case for so many others.
""It has that remarkable ability to bring happy memories flooding back from the deepest recesses of our memory, to comfort us in times of sadness, and to take us to distant places.
""But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration.
""In other words, it brings us joy.""
The full choice of tracks, with more royal commentary, will be published on Monday, for Commonwealth Day.
As well as as reggae from Marley and dance music from Minogue, there are expected to be contributions from Nigerian-American singer-songwriter Davido and British singer-songwriter Raye.
The King saw Raye at a concert at a Christmas market at the former Battersea Power Station, where Apple has its London headquarters.
The project is intended to be a different approach to Commonwealth Day, which sees the Royal Family gathering for a service in Westminster Abbey.
It will reflect the King's musical interests through his life, ranging from 1930s crooners to Afrobeat stars.
He is also expected to share anecdotes about some of the artists and reveals why the songs help form the soundtrack to his life.
""This seemed such an interesting and innovative way to celebrate this year's Commonwealth Day,"" the King said.
He has a longstanding interest in Marley and has visited the singer's former home in Jamaica, which has been turned into a museum.
And outside the palace windows, the band played Marley's message: ""Don't let them change ya, oh! Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no!""

Margaret Billings, 78, from Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, was on a boating trip with friends and family when she died along the Kennet and Avon Canal, in Devizes, on 27 June last year.
In a written statement, her husband of 51 years, Michael Billings, told Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner's Court they had been on more than 20 trips previously and were experienced - but said he remembered his wife's cry and a splash as she fell into the water.
Police said there were no suspicious circumstances and paramedics - including ones from an air ambulance - had tried to revive Ms Billings.
The couple were on the trip between Bradford on Avon and Devizes when the incident happened.
In the written statement, Mr Billings said they were experienced and confident in the water.
The court heard Ms Billings had been helping to moor the boat at Maton Lock, St Joseph's Place, Devizes.
She went to jump from the boat to the bank, but did not make it. However, the boat kept going forwards, crushing her, the inquest was told.
Mr Billings explained his wife had been standing about 3ft (0.9m) away from him and remembered telling her to wait. ""The next thing I heard was a cry and saw splashing water,"" he said.
""The boat weighed about 20 tonnes and I could see it crushing the life out of Margaret.""
He said it had happened very quickly - friends jumped in to pull her put of the water, which was about 4ft (1.2m) deep.
Paramedics arrived within minutes and she was pronounced dead soon after, the hearing was told.
A couple of days beforehand, she told her husband she had torn her achilles tendon and was limping but had been able to keep up when walking.
A post-mortem examination found she died from injuries consistent with being trapped between the boat and the side of the canal.
Area coroner Ian Singleton recorded a conclusion of accidental death.

BBC News","Three Ukrainian women with links to the Channel Islands have shared their hopes and fears after recent discussions about trying to end the ongoing war with Russia.
By April 2022 Jersey had welcomed 14 Ukrainian refugees and by March 2023 Guernsey had housed 24 Ukrainians.
There were unprecedented scenes in the White House last Friday when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and JD Vance in front of the world's media.
After the meeting Zelensky was ordered to leave the White House before flying to London where he received a strong show of support from European leaders who are at a Brussels summit to discuss future support for Ukraine.
Natalia Baker, born in Odessa and now living in Jersey, said she would love to see victory for Ukraine and celebrate it in Liberation Square ""like how we celebrate the Liberation in Jersey"".
While she lives in Jersey, Mrs Baker's family are still in Ukraine.
She said: ""We are losing - every day - children, fathers, brothers and mothers so this is tough for us.""
Mrs Baker said she believes a ceasefire and peace agreement need to be put in place.
""It doesn't matter that President Zelensky doesn't have a suit - he has a heart,"" she added.
Valeriya Sarnovska left Kyiv in 2022 and moved to Guernsey for a few years before returning to her home city where she is currently living.
""Every night I hear the sirens, I feel completely empty,"" she said.
""There are almost no families that have lost no-one to the war.""
She said if Ukraine loses international support it ""will disappear and our kids are going to read about Ukraine only in books"".
She added that Ukraine needed military help and said that she hoped European pressure would help lead to a resolution.
Olga Turkoglu, 36, moved to Guernsey in November 2017.
She said: ""Every day we wake up and read the news in the hope that something better has happened.""
She said ""so many"" Ukrainians were uncertain about their future but added that her voluntary work for the Humanitarian Aid Guernsey charity gives her a sense of calm when she feels helpless.
She said: ""We have cards and our cards are our people and our friends.
""The UK is a good friend and has our back.
""It kind of looks like it's hopeless but knowing that we have those cards gives us hope.
""We stopped the full-scale invasion in 2022, we didn't let Kyiv fall and we still have the belief that we will not stop and we will continue fighting.""

UK correspondent•@BBCDanielS","Warning: This article contains distressing details and descriptions of rape
When he was arrested in January 2024, serial rapist Zhenhao Zou was living on the 39th floor of an expensive block of London flats with views across the city.
A PhD student from China, he had been studying at University College London (UCL) and was paying more than £4,000 a month in rent.
Police found his bedroom had been equipped with hidden cameras and discovered a wardrobe stocked with alcohol, ecstasy and an industrial chemical that the human body turns into the ""date rape"" drug GHB. He had a pipette for carefully measuring doses of the dangerous liquid.
But detectives also found 1,277 videos on his electronic devices. At least some were filmed by Zou showing him raping unconscious women.
The footage had been filmed in both the UK and China. Police were able to charge him with multiple assaults on women in both countries - including the rapes of women who have never come forward and have never been identified.
During his trial at Inner London Crown Court, jurors had to watch footage found on Zou's devices of nine of the rapes. Zou, now 28, claimed he had been sleeping with five different women a month and taking cocaine, ketamine, ecstasy and what he called ""liquid E"" - the ""date rape"" drug GHB.
He admitted that having sex with unconscious women was one of his fantasies, but he claimed the women in the videos found on his phone and cameras were ""acting"" - helping, he claimed, to bring his rape fantasies to life in exchange for money and gifts.
However, the jury ultimately decided he was a serial rapist who had been drugging young women and filming the attacks.
Zou has now been found guilty of 11 rapes of 10 different women - two who have been identified and another eight who have yet to be traced - across two different continents.
Detectives say they fear he may have raped as many as 50 more women.
""This man may well turn out to be one of the most prolific sexual predators that we've ever seen in this country,"" Commander Kevin Southworth, from the Metropolitan Police, told the BBC.
Many of the women he raped were completely unconscious. One - who we are calling Ms L - said she woke up to find Zou raping her before she drifted back into unconsciousness. Another - who we are calling Ms N - only discovered Zou had secretly filmed himself raping her when detectives found the video in his flat, eight months after she had first reported him.
""I think he is a devious and Machiavellian individual,"" Commander Southworth told the BBC.
He said Zou would meet women socially, or through social media, and then take them back to his flat where he would ply them with drink laced with drugs.
""He would commit those sexual assaults while they're incapacitated and possibly even while they're asleep and completely unaware,"" added Commander Southworth.
Zou - who comes from Dongguan City, in southern China, close to Hong Kong - grew up in a wealthy family who owned several properties in China and were able afford the hefty fees for his higher education in the UK. His nickname was Pakho, the name some of the women he later raped knew him by.
At the age of 20 he moved to Northern Ireland to finish the final two years of his mechanical engineering degree at Queen's University, Belfast (QUB).
In September 2019, he then moved to London to study a Masters in mechanical engineering at UCL, but returned to China the following year during the Covid-19 pandemic.
While there, in November 2020, he used an obscure messaging app to download what amounted to an instruction manual on how to drug and rape young women. One advert police found on his phone had the words ""effects guaranteed"" splashed across pictures of sleeping, naked women.
On his telephone police also found seven videos of him raping women in China. They were referred to in court as Females B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Five of the women looked completely unconscious in the videos. One, Female G, appeared to wake briefly while Zou was raping her, but struggled to maintain consciousness. Female H could be heard snoring.
Another woman, Female D, was unconscious when the rape began but came round and repeatedly told Zou ""please, no"", while trying to fight him off. The videos were so disturbing that the judge, Rosina Cottage KC, made sure the jurors watched them as little as possible. Detectives have not been able to track down the women in China.
Although some of his victims were raped in China, Zou could be put on trial in the UK because he was resident here.
Saira Pike, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was important to bring justice for the unknown females who Zou could be seen raping in videos.
""It was really important that we fight for them,"" she said. ""I was determined to go forward with that and not use the fact that we couldn't identify the females as a deterrent from getting justice for them.""
But Zou did not only rape women in China.
Two of the most distressing videos showed the rape of Female A at Zou's student accommodation in Bloomsbury, central London. Police have never been able to establish who Female A is, and it is unclear if she was raped before or after Zou's trip to China during the pandemic.
At the start of the first video, Female A was seen to be unconscious, but woke and pleaded with Zou to stop. ""I hate you,"" she can be heard saying.
""It's pointless,"" Zou replied. ""The sound insulation here is very good.""
The second video is similar. Both had been filmed on a tiny spy camera the size of a thumb, placed on a shelf on the other side of the room.
When detectives first found the videos they could not extract the sound. At first Zou insisted the woman in the video was fully consenting to sex. But just before the trial, detectives managed to recover the sound, showing Female A was clearly under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and that she was begging him to stop.
Zou then changed his story, telling the jury it was ""rape role play"" and the young woman had been acting.
""Zou is plainly a depraved and cowardly individual who's preyed on his victim survivors in the most despicable manner,"" Commander Southworth said.
Police have never been able to trace Female A. However, two women did give evidence against Zou during the trial.
Ms N, a young Chinese student, described how she first met Zou in May 2023. He had been helping her with maths. A few days later, they both went to a party at another flat in his luxury block, the UNCLE building, in Elephant and Castle. After the party, he persuaded her to go back to his flat where he plied her with drinks.
The court heard Zou then dragged her into his bedroom where he raped her.
Some of their conversation in the flat was recorded on a spy camera beside Zou's bed, which was triggered by a motion sensor.
""Finish the drink,"" Zou kept saying on the video. ""Finish the drink. It should not be wasted.""
Ms N does not remember much after drinking the large glass of vodka. She reported the rape to the police soon afterwards, but unsure of the law, and she says discouraged by the officers' response - including a poor translation of her 999 call - she decided not to pursue the allegation.
The Metropolitan Police have said it was regretful victims did not get the best translation. ""There is undoubtedly some learning from the first response that these victims received,"" Commander Southworth added.
Eight months after Ms N first spoke to police, detectives contacted her again, telling her they had found the videos of Zou plying her with drink, and photographs on his phone showing her being raped.
Ms N was so upset about her ordeal that she also posted on the Chinese social media app Red Note (Xiaohongshu) warning other women about Zou. This was spotted by another woman - Ms L - who replied and said she had had a similar experience.
Ms L said she met Zou when she was 19, in August 2021. They had consensual sex a couple of times and had agreed to meet up with friends at a restaurant in London's Chinatown. The group moved onto a private room at another restaurant, drinking several bottles of Jack Daniel's. She has little memory of what happened after, but she ended up at Zou's Bloomsbury flat.
""When I woke up I found him on top of me having sex,"" she said.
When they searched Zou's flat after his arrest, police found four spy cameras.
The court heard they also found a yellow Fendi ""trophy box"" in the wardrobe containing jewellery and clothing which police think may have belonged to women he raped.
Police have not found any phones, computers or cameras from his time in Belfast so they do not know if his campaign of drug rape had already begun while he was studying there.
UCL said Zou was suspended on 27 January 2024 and he stopped studying there ""as soon we were informed about the allegations"".
The university said its online portal was available for students and staff affected by the case and that it was supporting the police appeal.
Zou was found guilty of 11 charges of raping 10 women, three counts of voyeurism, three counts of possessing a controlled drug with intent to rape, and one count of false imprisonment.
The jury found him not guilty of charges of possessing MDMA, Ketamine and Xanax with intent to rape. They also found him not guilty of two charges of possessing extreme pornography depicting rape.
Commander Southworth added: ""We have video evidence of as many as potentially 50 further victim survivors who we are desperate to trace so that we can establish what has happened to them.""
""Such is the insidious nature of this offending, I think there is a possibility that many more victim survivors may not even know that he has raped them,"" he added.
Detectives are asking any woman who may have spent any time alone with Zou - whether in China or in the UK - to come forward.

BBC News","The Royal Navy has released images of a Russian warship which it tracked sailing near British waters.
The corvette Boikiy was part of a task group which was tracked by HMS Somerset for three days as it made its way through the English Channel and North Sea, escorting a merchant vessel on its return from Syria to Russia.
Patrol aircraft and Nato forces also assisted with the monitoring operation, the navy said.
Boikiy is one of several Russian vessels to have been tracked sailing near the British coast in recent months.
The Royal Navy said its operation began on Saturday as the Russian warship headed south through the North Sea and English Channel to meet the merchant vessel, known as Baltic Leader, to escort it back to Russia.
Somerset, a British Type 23 frigate, used its radar system to report on the movements and a Merlin helicopter from its naval air squadron was also launched to gather information from the sky.
The Russian merchant ship was transporting military hardware from the Russian naval base in Tartus, Syria, with crew on the accompanying warship seen burning papers and manning the ship's machine guns, the Times reported.
BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery and found the Baltic Leader docked in Tartus on 1 February. At the time, its publicly-available tracker was turned off, according to ship tracking site MarineTraffic.
It is not possible to see what is on the ship, but imagery shows a number of containers and other items on the dock nearby.
According to shipping database Equasis, the owner of the Baltic Leader is Russian shipping company MG-Flot LLC - which was sanctioned by the UK government after being accused of helping Russia to destabilise Ukraine.
In 2022, the vessel was also sanctioned by the US due to its links to Russian lender Promsvyazbank, one of the Russian entities targeted by the US and European countries in the aftermath of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The ship's commanding officer, Cdr Joel Roberts, said: ""Somerset is well-versed in the escort of Russian ships, having conducted these operations on a number of occasions.
""Great professionalism has been shown by the ship's company to remain vigilant whilst operating in UK waters and integrating with our Nato allies to monitor Russian activity around Europe.""
It is the second time this year that Somerset has been used to track Russian activity off the British coast.
The operation comes two weeks after the navy monitored five ships, including three merchant vessels, as they sailed for a Russian Baltic port from Syria.
And in January, Defence Secretary John Healey told MPs the Royal Navy had monitored a Russian spy ship after it was spotted around UK waters - accusing the vessel, Yantar, of being used to gather intelligence and map the UK's underwater infrastructure.
He said the incident was ""another example of growing Russian aggression"", in claims which were described as ""absolutely baseless"" by the Russian embassy in London.
Western nations have often tracked Yantar operating in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables.
Russia has been accused of stepping up this activity since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

BBC News","A 28-year-old woman died after falling about 65ft from Tryfan mountain in Eryri National Park, an inquest has heard.
Maria Rosanova Eftimova, a structural civil engineer, from St Helens, Merseyside, slipped while attempting to climb rocks with friends on 22 February.
Coroner Kate Roberston stated that despite rescue crews and paramedics attending the scene, Ms Eftimova died before she could be taken to hospital.
In a tribute, Victoria Critchley, said she was ""ambitious, bright and cherished, whose vibrant personality, energy and aura touched and uplifted all around her"".
Tryfan is one of the highest mountains in Eryri National Park – and is often described as a peak that marks the line between hiking and mountaineering and is difficult to navigate in a traditional manner, especially in poor weather.
With no marked footpaths to the summit, it requires using hands and scrambling skills to reach the top.
It was used as a training ground to test oxygen equipment and safety techniques before the first ever successful climb of Everest in 1953.
Chris Lloyd, chairman of Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation, said people should ""check the weather forecast and make sure you are suitable equipped"" before venturing on the mountains.
At the opening of the inquest in Caernarfon on Wednesday, Ms Robertson said Ms Eftimova had attempted to reach a ledge for a handhold to lift herself up, but her heel slipped, which caused her to fall a ""considerable distance"".
A post mortem examination showed that Ms Eftimova, who is originally from Sofia, in Bulgaria, had suffered severe head injuries, including a fractured skull.
She added: ""I send my sincere condolences to all Maria Eftimova's family and friends.""

Home and Legal Correspondent•@BBCDomC
Adam Hale
BBC News","Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.
The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.
Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.
The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.
There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.
Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.
The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.
Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.
She said a cap on sitting days had a ""drastic effect"", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.
A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was ""unprecedented"", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.
""The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,"" she told the Today programme.
""We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,"" she added.
But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.
Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt ""out of reach"" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.
One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.
Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under ""immense pressure"" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.
""With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,"" she said.
""I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first.""
Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had ""accepted"" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.
The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.
Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: ""Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned.""
Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.
""We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years.""
Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of ""queues for justice"" were ""unacceptable"".
""This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,"" she told the BBC's Today programme.
She added that the state of courtrooms were in ""a pretty dire way"", and funding was also needed for upkeep.
""There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,"" she said.",UK

Royal correspondent, BBC News","There will be a four-day celebration of the 80th anniversary of VE Day, including a flypast, concert and a Westminster Abbey service, the government has announced.
The commemorations, marking 80 years since the end of World War Two in Europe, will run from the Bank Holiday Monday on 5 May, until 8 May.
Veterans will be joining the events, with only a shrinking number of that generation able to attend in what will be among the last major wartime commemorations involving those who served.
""People across society will be able to hear our veterans' stories first hand, to reflect and remember,"" Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said.
It would be an opportunity to ""pay tribute to all those who served in the Second World War and to reflect on the values that they were fighting for,"" said the culture secretary.
Among those who will be part of the commemorations is Ruth Bourne, 98, who worked at Eastcote, an outstation of Bletchley Park, where she was an operator of a wartime code-breaking machine, known as a ""Bombe"".
She remembers how the war had ended and the VE Day celebrations on 8 May 1945, when the Nazi regime in Germany had been defeated.
""There was an electric buzz among everyone and eventually the royals came out and waved, and we cheered like crazy waving whatever we had on us,"" Ruth says.
""People climbed on every available lamppost, lit bonfires in Hyde Park and we sat around singing songs.
""Not many went to bed that night.""
Defence Secretary John Healey said: ""The freedoms we enjoy today were defended by our remarkable Second World War generation.
""Our duty today is to safeguard the British values they sacrificed so much to uphold.""
Tara Knights, of the Royal British Legion, said: ""We will be running educational and community engagement programmes to encourage everyone to get involved in this momentous occasion.""
Arts Council England will also be helping communities and local organisations hold commemorative events.
It is not yet known which international guests might be attending, including whether US President Donald Trump will be part of the ceremonies.
Last year, for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the then US President, Joe Biden, joined commemorations in Normandy, alongside King Charles III, the UK's then prime minister Rishi Sunak, and leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.
The previous VE Day events, marking the 75th anniversary, were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.
For VE Day 80, there will be four days of events:
Later in the year, on 15 August, a service led by the Royal British Legion will be held at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire, to commemorate VJ Day, or Victory in Japan Day, and the end of the war.

BBC News, Isle of Man","A formal application for a fresh inquest into the deaths of 50 people in the 1973 Summerland fire disaster has been submitted to the Isle of Man's Attorney General.
The Justice for Summerland Group, made up of survivors and relatives of victims, has previously called for the original misadventure verdicts to be overturned.
Belfast-based human rights law firm Phoenix Law, representing the families, said it wanted to reopen the case to ""ensure a comprehensive investigation"" using ""modern legal and forensic standards"".
The Isle of Man government said the Attorney General's Chambers can confirm that an application has been received and will be given appropriate consideration.
About 3,000 people were at the Summerland entertainment complex, which at the time was one of the biggest indoor leisure complexes in Europe, when a blaze broke out on the evening of 2 August 1973,
It was thought to have been started by three boys from Liverpool smoking.
A public inquiry held in the aftermath found there were ""no villains"" and only human beings who made mistakes.
However, making its application, Phoenix Law said there had been an ""irregularity of proceedings in the original inquest"" which had not commented on or addressed ""substantial issues"" including the cause of the fire.
The firm said there was ""substantial fresh evidence which was not heard at the original inquest or commission which call into question the central conclusions"", suggesting the forensic analysis of the time was now ""unreliable"".
A spokesman also said several experts had provided written support for a fresh investigation into the fire ""on the premise that there have been significant developments within the forensic science on how fires are investigated"".
He said they had pointed to the Stardust Fire, in which 48 young people died in a fire in a north Dublin nightclub in 1981, where ""the cause of fire was established many years after the event"".
The firm's Darragh Mackin, who last year represented many families affected in the Stardust fire, said the relatives of those killed at Summerland had ""raised concerns about the original investigation"" for years.
It was ""difficult to envisage a more compelling set of circumstances to which point firmly in favour of a fresh investigation"", he added.

Royal correspondent","Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen.
Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.
We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.
It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with ""keepsake packaging"").
What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.
""I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,"" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.
She makes different types of pasta, crudités, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.
There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt.
""Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,"" Meghan explains. ""So I try to under salt.""
Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.
It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.
It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.
Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.
It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.
Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. ""Love is in the detail, gang,"" she says. And ""it's time to pop a bottle"" for a glass of champagne.
Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.
And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says ""Oh my God"" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.
It's also appearing for sale as ""raspberry spread"" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.
Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: ""This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,"" with picking fruit a ""daily task"".
The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with ""Wildflower honey with honeycomb"" going on sale.
We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower ""sprinkles"" are also part of the new range.
Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.
""When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,"" said Kaling.
""But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...""'
Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as ""it felt like the right thing to do"".
We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes ""high low"" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.
There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.
""I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',"" says Meghan.
There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: ""I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals."" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.
She's shown wrapping a gift and says: ""I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.""
As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.
In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this ""new chapter"" which is ""part of that creativity that I've missed so much"".
Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.
Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.
This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.

Kristopher Purvis, 35, was stopped by a Border Force officer in the Nothing to Declare channel at Edinburgh Airport on 24 July 2024.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard 45kg (99lb) of cocaine had been concealed in two suitcases carried by Purvis and his travelling companion.
Purvis admitted two charges related to drug smuggling.
The court heard Purvis and his friend each had a suitcase and he was carrying a plastic bag containing four traditional Mexican sombrero souvenir hats.
Advocate depute Brian Gill KC told the High Court in Edinburgh: ""The accused told the officer that they had come from Mexico, where they had been since June 30 2024.""
The prosecutor told the court Purvis told the officer the ""only thing that he had acquired in Mexico was the sombreros"".
However, when his suitcase was searched eight vacuum-sealed plastic packages containing cocaine were discovered.
A further seven packages were found in the other suitcase.
The court heard Purvis was cautioned and replied: ""It's all mine, my mate had nothing to do with it. I put it in his case.""
The 15 packages were each found to contain about 3kg (6.6lb) of 52% pure cocaine.
The court heard the maximum street value of the drugs was about £5,640,000.
Purvis, formerly of Murton, County Durham, was found to have flown from Mexico City airport to Edinburgh via a stopover at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.
He admitted being concerned in the supply of cocaine and the fraudulent evasion of the ban on importing controlled drugs.
Defence solicitor advocate Ewen Roy said that as Purvis was a first offender a background report would be required ahead of sentencing.
The judge, Lord Summers, deferred sentence on Purvis, who followed the proceedings via a TV link to Edinburgh prison, for the preparation of the report.",UK

Researchers from the University of Exeter carried out analysis to identify prey in the guts of more than 1,500 hornet larvae from 103 nests in Jersey, France, Spain and the UK.
They raised concerns over the ""extra threat"" species poses to native insects already under pressure.
The main prey of the Asian hornet is honeybees, with one insect killing up to 50 bees a day, devastating entire colonies.
Researchers identified 1,449 different species which had been fed by adult Asian hornets to their larvae in the nests, more than half of which (55%) could be identified as a specific species.
They found prey included a range of flies, wasps, bees, butterflies, moths and spiders, with honeybees, common wasps and blowflies most commonly found.
Siffreya Pedersen, the study's lead author, said: ""Asian hornets were known to prey on honeybees, but until now the full range of their diet had not been tested.
""The diet varied strongly over the seasons and between regions, showing that they are highly flexible predators.""
She said insects played ""vital roles in enabling ecosystems to function - including pollination, decomposition and pest control"".
""Most insect populations are in decline due to factors such as habitat destruction and chemical pollution,"" she said.
""The expanding area inhabited by Asian hornets poses an extra threat.""

BBC News","A non-native invasive grey squirrel on the loose in Guernsey will have to remain in an enclosure once caught, rescuers have said.
The Guernsey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) said last week the squirrel, named Elvis, ""accidentally"" found its way to the island ""via a vehicle"".
Paul Allum, who runs Hitchin Squirrel Rescue in the UK, offered to look after Elvis if it is captured but said the animal would have to stay in a large enclosure outside.
He said squirrels were ""classed as invasive species [and] it is against the law to release them"".
Grey squirrels spread rapidly in the UK after they were introduced in the 19th Century but Guernsey does not have an established population of the species.
Islanders have been told not to gather where the stowaway squirrel has been sighted.
Mr Allum said: ""The only concern is not knowing whether it's a female.
""If it's a female, there is a concern that it is baby season now. You never know, she could be pregnant.
""Normally they don't breed 'til after a year old.""
Judging from the pictures, Mr Allum said Elvis appears appeared to be healthy and guessed it could be ""a last August baby"".
""It doesn't look too old,"" he said.
He said he had been in touch with States of Guernsey veterinary officer David Chamberlain about arrangements for caring for Elvis if it is captured.
Mr Allum said: ""Every animal, no matter what, deserves a chance in life.""
Details for taking it back to the UK were ""in discussion"", he added.
""They're not sure which is the best way to tackle it, whether it would be by flying or by boat,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0ej1ljwpo,The families devastated by the terrible cruelty of serial killer Peter Tobin,2025-03-04T08:17:11.439Z,"David Cowan
Home affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland","On the day police found a second body behind a house once occupied by a murderer, the father of a missing teenager raised his hand, crossed his fingers and said he hoped it was his daughter.
Dinah McNicol was 18 when she vanished in 1991, after hitchhiking home to Essex from a dance music festival in Hampshire.
Her father had spoken to countless reporters since then and it just so happened that I was interviewing him when 16 years of tortuous uncertainty were coming to an end.
Ian McNicol had been left in such a dark place that he wanted his daughter to be the person in a shallow grave, because it would mean the family would finally know where she was, get her back, and lay her to rest.
His words laid bare the terrible cruelty of serial killers and they've haunted me ever since.
A new BBC documentary, The Hunt for Peter Tobin, explains how the murder of a young Polish student finally solved the mystery of what had happened to Dinah and a second teenager, 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton, who had gone missing in central Scotland six months earlier in February 1991.
Tobin was a registered sex offender on the run from the authorities when he killed Angelika Kluk and concealed her body beneath the floor of a Glasgow church in September 2006.
He was 60 at the time. The crime was so horrific, detectives were convinced he must have killed before.
Strathclyde Police launched Operation Anagram, a nationwide scoping exercise which tried to establish whether Tobin could be linked to unsolved cases around the UK.
Within months, officers realised he was living in Bathgate when Vicky Hamilton went missing in the West Lothian town.
Despite a huge inquiry and appeals by her distraught family, 15 years had passed with no trace of Vicky ever being found.
The link with Tobin changed everything.
Forensic scientists re-examined evidence from the time of her disappearance and found DNA from Tobin's son on Vicky's purse, which had been left near Edinburgh bus station.
In June 2007, Lothian and Borders Police searched Tobin's former home in Bathgate. In the attic, they discovered a knife which bore traces of Vicky's DNA.
Operation Anagram went on to connect Tobin to Dinah, who'd gone missing at the other end of the country in August 1991.
Her cash card had been used in towns across the south-east of England, from Hove to Margate and Ramsgate in Kent.
The money draining from Dinah's account was compensation she received after her mother Judy died in a road accident when she was six.
The police found evidence linking Tobin to the card and established he was living in Margate when Dinah failed to come home.
One of Tobin's neighbours recalled ""Scottish Pete"" digging a deep hole in his back garden around that time.
Essex Police thought they were going to get answers for Ian McNicol and his family when they went to Tobin's old house at 50 Irvine Drive in November 2007 - but instead of Dinah, they found Vicky.
Having covered the search in Bathgate, I travelled south to Margate with a sense of disbelief which was shared by the Scottish officers investigating Tobin's past.
Everyone in Scotland knew the face of the smiling schoolgirl with the bobbed dark hair.
The discovery of her remains so far from home was horrifying and baffling. How had she ended up there?
The answer was that Tobin had killed Vicky in Bathgate, dismembered her body, and taken her remains with him when he moved to a new house 470 miles away in the south of England.
In the days that followed, as the police continued their search for Dinah at Irvine Drive, I interviewed her dad at his home in Tillingham, a small Essex village built round a Norman church.
Ian was an instantly likeable man in his late 60s; a retired musician originally from Glasgow who'd named his daughter after a jazz standard.
Over the years, Dinah's disappearance had taken its toll on his health. We sat down and started filming.
""When I lost my wife, we knew she was dead because we had to bury her,"" he said.
""We went through the normal process of grief.
""When a member of your family goes missing, it's 20 times worse than death because you do not know a thing and all sorts of things go through your imagination.""
He was taking some solace from the fact that another family in exactly the same situation had been helped, even though his daughter had not been found.
Ian turned to the camera to address Vicky's family and said: ""If you're watching, from me and my family, good luck to you. We wish you all the best.""
The doorbell rang. Another reporter told us the police had just announced the discovery of a second body.
Ian agreed to continue the interview, raised his right hand with his fingers crossed and said: ""If they've said that, please be Dinah, and get us out of this misery.
""I would bury her next to her mother. So please, let it be Dinah.""
Later, after the police confirmed the remains were those of his daughter, Ian said he could die in peace. He passed away in 2014.
In the BBC documentary, Vicky's younger sister Lindsay Brown tells of the impact her disappearance had on their mother Jeanette. Two years after Vicky went missing her mother died, her family said, from a broken heart.
Archive footage shows Lindsay reading a statement to the media outside the High Court in Dundee in 2008, on the day Tobin was convicted of Vicky's murder, flanked by her older sister Sharon and twin brother Lee.
Given all they had been through, what she did that day was as brave as it was difficult to watch.
She said: ""Vicky was much more than the girl who was abducted and killed by a stranger or a girl on a missing poster. We will always remember Vicky as she lived, not as she died.""
The detectives investigating Tobin's past were certain he had other victims. They did all they could to find answers for other families, to no avail.
Tobin took his secrets to the grave and was serving three life sentences when he died in 2022.
No-one came forward to claim his body. His ashes were disposed of at sea.
When I was interviewed for the BBC documentary, the producer asked what I had thought when I heard the news.
I told him I had been pleased and hoped his death hadn't been pleasant. Should I have been that honest? Did it cross a line? I don't know.
What I do know is that I'll never forget Ian McNicol or what he said to me 17 years ago: ""Please be Dinah.""",UK
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y0ld2ngyo,Five things we learned from Meghan's interview ahead of Netflix series,2025-03-04T08:16:24.311Z,"Sean Coughlan
Royal correspondent","The Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle TV series has launched on Netflix on Tuesday morning, but an interview with People magazine in the US has already given an insight into what's on the menu.
Here are some of the things we have learned:
With Love, Meghan is an eight-episode series of cookery, gardening and chats with famous friends.
That doesn't always mean fine dining, as the interview says Chinese take-away food is a favourite in their Californian home.
""But even when I get take-out, I will try to plate it beautifully,"" says Meghan.
For those already feeling unworthy, she says: ""The series is about doing what you can do... and doing it with love.""
They go out to eat too. ""We go to a lot of dinners, and not just in people's homes or private rooms; we just go into the restaurant... I really love that we can just have fun.""
Perhaps more reassuringly, Prince Harry and their five-year-old son Prince Archie are keen on fried eggs, says Meghan, who reveals she's usually up at 6.30am.
""I love making breakfast for my family,"" she says.
But don't expect to see much of Prince Harry in this series, apparently there's only a glimpse towards the end of the series. As the title suggests, this is about Meghan.
This series seems to be seeing Meghan going back to her pre-royal roots, when she had a lifestyle blog, The Tig.
But Meghan doesn't see herself as an influencer.
""I see myself as an entrepreneur and a female founder... and if the brand ends up influential, then that's great.""
We know that she's launching a new lifestyle product range called As Ever, in a partnership with Netflix, so there could be some entrepreneurial overlaps.
""It's almost like a honeymoon period again,"" says Meghan.
Meghan makes working on the show sound almost like a rekindling of their first romance, for her and Harry.
""I see this spark in his eye when he sees me doing the thing that I was doing when he first met me,"" she says.
The thing in question was all the work on the blog.
""Scribbling away, writing newsletters, fine-tuning edits and just really being in the details of it.
""I think he loves watching as much as I love doing that creative process. It's just been fun.
""This is who I've always been.""
There was a previous podcast, called Archetypes, which faced some tough criticism. The magazine says her new podcast with Lemonada Media is launching this spring.
Meghan has had to face plenty of hostility over the years. And in this interview she talks about responding to constant public scrutiny, including over the development of this latest venture.
""There are tons of twists and turns - even with the name,"" she says.
""I was figuring it out in real time.""
She added: ""I appreciate everyone who gave me the grace to make mistakes and figure it out and also to be forgiving with myself through that.
""It's a learning curve.""
In terms of their own current media consumption: ""We love Shrinking, we just finished Black Doves, and we're excited for the new season of The White Lotus,"" she said.
While their last Netflix series was raking over their departure from lives as working royals, this latest series is not expected to go into their disputes with the palaces or the Royal Family.
Instead this will be a more upbeat offering, full of expensive kitchens, flowers and sunny views from their new lives in California. It's looking ahead and not back.
But for the people of one faraway corner of southern England, there is a nod to their Sussex titles.
""It's our shared name as a family, and I guess I hadn't recognised how meaningful that would be to me until we had children,"" she says.
""I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H and I all have together.
""It means a lot to me.""",UK
https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c2d4wee699do,Piastri leads Norris to McLaren one-two in China,2025-03-23T08:53:37.289Z,,"Piastri has now won three F1 grands prix
Oscar Piastri led Lando Norris to a dominant McLaren one-two in the Chinese Grand Prix ahead of George Russell's Mercedes.
Piastri's calm, controlled victory made it two wins from two for McLaren at the start of the season following Norris' outstanding drive in the wet in Melbourne last weekend.
The Australian led from pole and lost first place only briefly in the period around the leaders' only pit stops. Piastri was rarely more than four seconds ahead of Norris but always in control.
Norris was struggling with fading brakes in the closing laps but had enough of an advantage to hold Russell at bay.
Charles Leclerc drove an outstanding race in a Ferrari with a damaged front wing, faster than team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who moved out of his way.
But the pair were disqualified after the race - for separate technical infringements - along with Alpine's Pierre Gasly.
During the race, Leclerc lost fourth place to Red Bull's Max Verstappen with four laps to go as the world champion's car found some pace in the second half of the race.
Hamilton, who took an outstanding victory in the shorter sprint race on Saturday, had resisted the team orders call for a couple of laps before letting Leclerc by and then dropped back.
The seven-time champion made a second pit stop, while the other leaders all stayed out on their single set of hard tyres, fitted at their only pit stops.
The result leaves Norris leading the championship by eight points from Verstappen, with Russell a further point adrift, and Piastri one behind Russell.
It was a copybook win for Piastri, the third of his F1 career, and founded on the advantage he earned by scoring his maiden pole position on Saturday.
Piastri held off a challenge from Russell off the line by forcing the Briton to the inside, and the Mercedes' compromised line allowed Norris to pass Russell before the end of the long Turn One, Two, Three complex.
Once running one-two, the McLaren drivers settled into a comfortable race, disrupted only when Russell stopped on the same lap as Piastri, one lap before Norris.
As Norris came out of the pits, Russell was battling Lance Stroll's Aston Martin, which had stayed out, and the presence of Stroll boxed Norris in and allowed Russell to retain second place.
Russell cleared Stroll first and Norris soon after, and the McLaren driver was able to pass the Mercedes with a daring move into Turn One a lap later.
Russell hung on to Norris for 10 laps or so, before the McLaren edged further ahead as McLaren asked Piastri to speed up a little to allow Norris to have some breathing space from the Mercedes if a second stop was required.
Once it became clear that the hard tyres would last to the end, the top three positions were set, even though Norris was struggling with a long brake pedal in the final 15 laps.
With five laps to go, Norris was told to make sure he finished the race with ""no hard braking"", his race engineer Will Joseph underlining that in the context of the championship, ""18 points is better than no points at all"".
With two laps to go, Norris was really struggling, and his eight-second lead was cut to just one by Russell on the final lap, but he survived.
Russell challenged for the lead at the start but would eventually lose a place
Leclerc damaged his front wing as his inside line around the first corners pincered him and Hamilton towards each other, and an oversteer snap slid him into the sister Ferrari as both managed to pass Verstappen, who slipped from fourth to sixth with his outside line.
The collision tore off Leclerc's left-front endplate but although Ferrari told him he had lost siginficant downforce, he was faster than Hamilton, tracking the seven-time champion through the first stint.
They returned to the track after their pit stops with Hamilton still ahead and, within five laps, with Leclerc right behind his team-mate, the team asked Hamilton to let the Monegasque by.
The television broadcast suggested Hamilton was resisting the request. Hamilton was heard saying over the team radio: ""When he's closer."" And pushed back again when the team insisted and said where to do it, saying: ""I'll tell you when we're going to swap"", before eventually acquiescing.
But both Hamilton and team boss Frederic Vasseur said after the race that the initial idea to swap had come from Hamilton because he was struggling for pace - and Vasseur said he would complain to F1 about what he said was selective and misleading editing of team radio.
Leclerc challenged Russell for second, tracking right behind the Mercedes from laps 25 to 28 before a snap at the hairpin gave Russell some breathing space.
Once Hamilton had made his stop for a second set of tyres, Verstappen had a clear run at Leclerc and with four laps to go was on the Ferrari's tail.
Verstappen took fourth with a lovely move at the start of lap 54, going around the outside of the right-handed Turn One before cutting back to go for the outside again at Turn Three as Leclerc was compromised by his tight entry.
Leclerc fought back into Turn Six, but Verstappen fended off the Ferrari to cement the position.
Hamilton took sixth, closing to just two seconds adrift of Leclerc at the flag on his fresher tyres.
The best of the rest was Esteban Ocon's Haas, in a much-improved showing after a poor opening race for the US-based team. He led home the second Mercedes of Andrea Kimi Antonelli, compromised by a floor damaged on lap one by running over Leclerc's front wing debris, Williams' Alex Albon and the second Haas of Briton Oliver Bearman.

BBC News","A caravan found packed with explosives in outer Sydney earlier this year was part of a ""fabricated terrorism plot"" concocted by criminals, Australian police have said.
The caravan, which was found in north-western Sydney on 19 January, contained enough explosives to produce a 40m-wide blast, along with a note displaying antisemitic messages and a list of Jewish synagogues.
Its discovery, following a spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia, triggered widespread panic.
But on Monday, Australian Federal Police (AFP) revealed that they knew ""almost immediately"" that the caravan was ""essentially a criminal con job"".
AFP's deputy commissioner of national security, Krissy Barrett, said investigators within the New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team believed that the caravan was ""part of a fabricated terrorism plot"".
Authorities arrived at that belief based on information they already had, the ease with which they found the caravan and the visibility of the explosives contained inside – as well as the fact that there was no detonator.
Yet police refrained from telling the public that they believed the plot was fake ""out of an abundance of caution"", as they continued to receive tip-offs about other related terror plots. They are now confident that these tip-offs were also fabricated, Ms Barrett said.
The fake caravan plot involved several people with different levels of involvement, according to police. Between them, they had planned to purchase a caravan, load it with explosives and antisemitic materials and leave it in a specific location, before informing law enforcement about ""an impending terror attack against Jewish Australians"".
Ms Barrett described it as ""an elaborate scheme contrived by organised criminals, domestically and from offshore"", adding that the leader of the plot maintained a distance and hired alleged local criminals to carry out parts of the operation.
That individual is a known organised crime figure, Ms Barrett confirmed. She also added that while no arrests had been made in relation to the incident, police have a number of ongoing targets both in Australia and offshore.
""Too many criminals are accused of paying others to carry out antisemitic or terrorism incidents to get our attention or divert our resources,"" Ms Barrett said. She also noted that police believe ""the person pulling the strings wanted changes to their criminal status"".
Criminals in these kinds of scenarios often leverage the exchange of information into law enforcement for some kind of personal gain, mostly around sentence reduction, Ms Barrett explained.
BBC News contacted AFP for more details on the suspected agenda of those behind the caravan hoax, but received no further comment.
""Regardless of the motivation of those responsible for this fake plot, this has had a chilling effect on the Jewish community,"" Ms Barrett said in her statement.
""What organised crime has done to the Jewish community is reprehensible, and it won't go without consequence. There was also unwarranted suspicion directed at other communities – and that is also reprehensible.""
Separately, New South Wales police arrested 14 people on Monday morning as part of Strike Force Pearl: a police operation established in December 2024 to investigate antisemitic hate crimes across Sydney.
The establishment of the Strike Force followed a string of antisemitic attacks in Australia in late-2024, including the vandalism of a Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs and the arson of a childcare centre, which was set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages.
Speaking to the media on Monday, police said they believed all those incidents had a ""common source"" with the caravan plot.
""The caravan job was orchestrated by the same individual or individuals that were orchestrating the Pearl incidents,"" said NSW Police deputy commissioner David Hudson.
Mr Hudson further noted, however, that ""none of the individuals we have arrested during Pearl have displayed any form of antisemitic ideology.""
""I think what these organised crime heads have done is play to vulnerabilities in the community,"" he later explained.
""Obviously there have been antisemitic attacks of a lower nature, and a lot of anger and angst in the community – we've seen that since October 7th, 2023... And I think these organised crime figures have taken an opportunity to play on the vulnerability of the Jewish community.""",Australia

BBC News
Reporting fromCairns","A jury in the trial of a former nurse accused of murdering a woman on a remote Australian beach has been discharged, after they could not reach a verdict.
Toyah Cordingley was stabbed at least 26 times while out walking her dog in October 2018.
The 24-year-old's body was discovered by her father, half-buried in sand dunes on Wangetti beach between the popular tourist hotspots of Cairns and Port Douglas.
Rajwinder Singh, 40, who travelled to India the day after Ms Cordingley's body was found, was charged with murder. He was arrested and then extradited to Australia in 2023.
But jurors at Cairns Supreme Court said they were deadlocked, and unable to reach a unanimous decision on his guilt after two-and-half days of deliberations. The judge thanked the jury for their ""diligence"".
Under Queensland law, jury verdicts in murder cases must be unanimous. So Mr Singh will face another trial.
Originally from Buttar Kalan in the Indian state of Punjab, Mr Singh had been living in Innisfail at the time of the killing, a town about two hours south from the crime scene.
Prosecutors said they did not have a motive for the killing of Ms Cordingley - a health store worker and animal shelter volunteer - and there was no evidence of a sexual assault.
The trial at Cairns Supreme court heard that DNA highly likely to be Mr Singh's was discovered on a stick in the victim's grave.
Data from mobile phone towers also suggested Ms Cordingley's phone had moved in a similar pattern to Mr Singh's blue Alfa Romeo car on the day the victim went missing.
The prosecution also suggested the hurried way Mr Singh left Australia without saying goodbye to his family or colleagues pointed to his guilt.
Mr Singh had denied murder – and had told an undercover police officer he had seen the killing, then left the country, leaving behind his wife and children because he feared for his own life.
His defence lawyer said he was ""a coward"" but not a killer, and accused police of a ""flawed"" investigation that did not look sufficiently at other possible suspects.
They said DNA found at the scene, including on the victim's discarded selfie stick, did not match Mr Singh's profile.
""There is an unknown person's DNA at that grave site,"" defence barrister Angus Edwards told the jury.",Australia
https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cedlelgxgz8o,'Copybook victory as Norris and McLaren come through chaos unscathed',2025-03-16T11:40:07.535Z,,"Lando Norris' four previous F1 wins had come in dry races
Lando Norris and McLaren delivered on their potential with a copybook victory in a demanding Australian Grand Prix in the most difficult of conditions to put their stamp on the start of the new season.
Briton Norris described his win as ""stressful but rewarding"".
The first adjective was justified by the conditions in a madcap, crash-strewn, incident-packed race where one small error can spell disaster - as it very nearly did for Norris himself at one point.
The second adjective was a recognition of the fact that this was exactly the kind of race in which, last year, McLaren had proved less than perfect, and thrown away at least one potential victory, and perhaps another, too.
But in Melbourne they were as perfect as it is possible to be in conditions such as these - even the renowned rain-master Max Verstappen slipped up at one point. And Norris and McLaren came through the chaos unscathed.
The fine line between victory and defeat was underlined by an incident with 13 laps to go that defined the race.
Norris was leading from team-mate Oscar Piastri and Verstappen as a heavy shower of rain approached the track.
It hit as the leaders were negotiating the final corners on lap 44, with 13 to go.
Both McLarens ran wide on to the gravel at the exit of Turn 12, and Australian Piastri then spun through Turn 13.
Norris was able to continue without losing too much time, but Piastri ended up on the grass on the outside of Turn 12, where he sat with his wheels spinning helplessly for what seemed like an age as his hopes of victory at home evaporated before finally rejoining. He fought back to ninth by the end.
Norris immediately pitted for treaded tyres. That decision won him the race, and demonstrated how far he and the team had come since last year - they had planned that they would pit as soon as it rained, and acted decisively on the plan.
Verstappen stayed out and took the lead, but as the rain intensified he lost more time, and Norris resumed the lead when the Dutchman pitted himself two laps later.

'I'm just embarrassed' - tough introduction for F1 rookies
Norris said: ""It's so easy to make a mistake, so easy to ruin everything. So quickly it can all have gone wrong within a second.
""Any second of the race, you lock up, you hit the white line wrong, you have a big snap. It was just very, very difficult at times to just not go into a hole or a tyre barrier somewhere.
""That's a big enough challenge, but then when you've got the weather changing and the track conditions changing, knowing when to make the correct decision to change on to a slick tyre and stay out on the inter-tyre, and then even more when I've got Max behind me and Oscar behind me, it's stressful.
""But that's what makes it rewarding.
""We worked a lot over the winter to prepare for a race like this, because it's where we threw away a lot of opportunities last season - Canada, Silverstone, where we were not the best at preparing and knowing how decisive we've got to be.
""Today we were very, very decisive, calling to box five metres before I boxed. But it was the right call in the end, and that won us the race.""
The race was not over, though.
In the final five laps after the final restart, Norris had Verstappen right behind him. The McLaren was hampered by significant floor damage - incurred either in the previously mentioned off, or in another in those final laps at Turn Six - but he hung on, despite Verstappen being less than a second behind, and having use of the DRS overtaking aid.
The 25-year-old Norris, for whom last season was his first fighting consistently at the front, underlined his inexperience when he said: ""That situation was new for me. I've not ever led a race with five laps to go with Max behind me, trying to put me under pressure, and in these conditions.
""Maybe Max has had that a few times in his race against Lewis (Hamilton) a lot, and he can just deal with that probably better than I can.
""I'm happy I got through it and stayed calm. It's something I improved from last year.""
McLaren's performance was as expected. They were the quickest car all weekend and delivered on a status as favourites that Norris acknowledged both before and after the race was justified.
They earned it in pre-season testing, but Norris said that, while the long run in Bahrain two weeks ago had demonstrated their strong pace, the car was not necessarily as good as some felt it looked there.
The job, he emphasised, was only just beginning, and not all races would be like this.
""The car's flying,"" Norris said. ""But we're going to have races where we are going to struggle.
""[If] we race in Bahrain as round one, I wouldn't be confident that we could win the race.
""But I'm confident that we're going to, say, China next weekend, and we can be very, very strong, because we were strong there last year, with not a very good car.""

In the post-race news conference, with Verstappen and Mercedes' George Russell either side of him, Norris also pointed out that he felt that Piastri's presence alongside him was partly responsible for McLaren's strong weekend, making a pointed reference to the rookie team-mates of his rivals.
""Let's allow a few more races to take place before we start making any (predictions), but we're the favourites, we are the team to beat, mainly because we have two drivers up there pushing each other,"" he said.
""That helps. Do I think me and Oscar working together yesterday, in terms of pushing one another, allowed us to get one and a half, one 10th more than the two drivers here, because their team-mates aren't as equipped and as experienced? Yes.""
Verstappen and Russell, meanwhile, were talking as if they know that McLaren will take some beating.
Verstappen was reflecting on the fact that he lost 15 seconds to the McLarens over the first stint as the track dried.
""As the tyres started to overheat we had no chance,"" he said. ""Yet basically McLaren just took off.
""We still have a lot of work to do to fight for a win, but I'm very happy that we are second here. It's basically one place better than we should have been. We'll do our best.""
Russell added: ""They look pretty good and groovy at the moment, so we'll see.""

BBC News","A US influencer who was filmed taking a wild baby wombat away from its distressed mother in Australia has said she is ""truly sorry"" and received thousands of death threats over the incident.
Sam Jones, who calls herself an ""outdoor enthusiast and hunter"", was filmed picking up the joey on the side of a road, while laughing and running over to a car, while the mother chases after them.
It sparked a huge backlash, with Australian PM Anthony Albanese challenging her to ""take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there"".
In a lengthy statement on her Instagram page, Jones says she was trying to get the animals safely off the road.
She said, as can be seen in the video, that the mother runs off the road, but the baby does not, and Jones scoops it up. She says she ran across the road ""not to rip the joey away from its mother, but from fear she might attack me"".
""The snap judgement I made in these moments was never from a place of harm or stealing a joey,"" the statement said.
She said the video was ""not staged, nor was it done for entertainment"", and in her excitement of the moment, ""acted too quickly and failed to provide necessary context to viewers online"".
In the second part of her statement, Jones launched a scathing attack on Australia's animal culling laws, including wombats, kangaroos, horses, deer and pigs.
Australia has various culling laws and regulations that spark controversy and divide the nation.
Wombats, which are native to Australia, are a protected species, but permits can be obtained to cull them if deemed necessary.
An online petition supporting her deportation received more than 40,000 signatures. Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said his department was reviewing whether it could revoke Jones's visa. However, the BBC understands that she left the country of her own accord.
Jones, who also goes by the name Samantha Strable, has more than 95,000 followers on Instagram.
Conservationists warned Jones's ""appalling"" behaviour could have caused severe harm to the wombats.
The Wombat Protection Society said it was shocked to see the ""mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for 'social media likes'"".
""[She] then placed the vulnerable baby back onto a country road - potentially putting it at risk of becoming roadkill,"" it noted in its statement, adding that it remained unclear if the joey had been reunited with its mother.
""I caught a baby wombat,"" Jones said in the video, while the joey could be heard hissing and struggling in her grip.
The man filming can be heard laughing: ""Look at the mother, it's chasing after her!""
Her caption in the now-deleted post read: ""My dream of holding a wombat has been realised! Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush.""
""The baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom,"" she wrote in the comments, responding to criticism.
""They wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed. I don't ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so.""
Animal rights organisations have criticised Jones. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or Peta, described the video as ""wildlife-exploiting content"" and urged people to ""stop treating wildlife as a prop"".",Australia

Around 287,000 customers are experiencing outages in south east Queensland, according to energy provider Energex, while Essential Energy said more than 42,600 homes and businesses in New South Wales had experienced blackouts.
People in Brisbane, Queensland's capital, went to bed on Friday bracing for strong winds and heavy rain.
They woke up on Saturday to learn that the cyclone had been downgraded and the city would escape the worst of the weather.
But the danger's not over in other parts of southeastern Queensland and northern New South Wales.
Along the Gold Coast, pummelled by bad weather the past few days, conditions have been very strong with driving rain and strong winds.
Hundreds of trees have been blown over in gardens, parks and along the main roads. There has been lots of debris and emergency services had sectioned off areas most at risk.
""This emergency is not over,"" said New South Wales state premier Chris Minns, adding that it was ""crucially important"" the public did not ""dismiss"" the storm.
""It really doesn't matter to us whether it's been downgraded from a tropical cyclone to a weather event,"" he said.
The state's emergency service operations commander, Stuart Fisher, warned people not to be ""complacent"" and said authorities in the region expect flooding to continue over the next few days.
As the storm has edged closer to landfall, nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled.
Flights are not expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest.
The BBC spoke to several people from Brisbane's homeless community, who took refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, which had become a round-the-clock shelter.
At the Treasure Island Holiday Park in the Gold Coast, just north of Surfer's Paradise, a gum tree had come down between two cabins, damaging a third. Nearby, a boat was half submerged in one of the canals a block away from the beach.
On the coast itself, many paths down to the beach are now unpassable. Instead, there's a sudden drop to the ocean where the powerful waves have eaten away at the sand.
But the clean-up operation won't happen for a few days – the wind is still powerful and there's driving rain.
Residents are starting to venture out to look at the damage, but plenty are remaining indoors to keep themselves safe.

Reporting fromBrisbane","Residents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been waiting anxiously as a tropical storm - downgraded from Cyclone Alfred - crawls towards them, leaving thousands in the dark.
Four million people are in the firing line of what was thought to be the region's first tropical cyclone in 50 years. Tens of thousands were told to evacuate ahead of the storm, which is expected to make landfall on Saturday.
Most have taken heed of warnings to stay indoors - taping up their windows and strapping down garden furniture - while shops have lined sandbags in front of their doors.
Ex-cyclone Alfred's path slowed in recent days, with one meteorologist describing it as a ""walking pace"", which sparked fears of prolonged rain and flooding.
In southern Brisbane, a popular city in Queensland, some from the homeless community have taken refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, filling the floor on rows of inflatable air mattresses.
The space, usually a day centre for people needing a shower or a hot meal, has become a round-the-clock shelter.
The BBC spoke to people at the centre when the tropical storm was still categorised as a cyclone.
Operations manager Tim Noonan told the BBC that most government-funded charities in the inner city of Brisbane have shut down since Thursday, leaving limited options for those in need.
It may be the first time in a long while that homeless people - who typically live in tents in parks or along riverbanks - have a proper resting space, he said.
""It's counter intuitive...but this is the best they've been looked after. They've got somewhere to sleep.
""For a lot of them, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an eight-hour sleep in air conditioning, going to bed on a full belly, waking up, getting a barista coffee and a bacon and egg burger,"" he said.
Mr Noonan said he hoped the cyclone would highlight the need for better funding for organisations such as his.
""We'd love for when the cyclone passes, that these people don't become invisible again,"" he said.
Lauren Gorman was spending her second night at the centre with her dog Charcoal.
""I live on the streets, we have a housing crisis, and now we have a cyclone. This place has been amazing for finding other people who are doing it rough and getting information,"" she told the BBC.
""I'm not scared, but I am worried for others who are still on the streets.""
While the authorities have warned for days about the cyclone, some die-hard surfers have instead seized the opportunity to ride the high waves.
Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said complacency is the biggest risk - especially as the arrival of what was then categorised as a cyclone, kept being pushed back.
""We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being asked to evacuate, but lots of people aren't going because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's hard to take that notice to evacuate seriously, perhaps, when the sun is still shining in your backyard,"" Wells told the BBC.
Now a tropical storm, winds are set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast.
On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Meteorology, warned of the ongoing risk of severe weather, explaining that ""24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days.""
She told ABC News Breakfast that ""rain is still coming through in full force... [with] widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well.""
Flash and riverine flooding is the biggest concern especially in low-lying areas.
Some residents have been told they could be without power for days, with more than 230,000 households currently in the dark.

BBC News","Police in Australia have charged a 17-year-old who got on a plane with a shotgun and ammunition.
He was filmed being wrestled to the ground by passengers and crew as the aircraft prepared to take off from Avalon Airport, near Melbourne, carrying 160 people bound for Sydney on Thursday afternoon.
Police believe the teenager got onto the airport tarmac by breaching a security fence, before climbing the front steps to the plane, where he was tackled to the ground near the front door.
The 17-year-old - who has not been identified - was taken into custody and will appear in youth court to face eight charges.
Among them are unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, endangering the flight's safety and creating a bomb hoax.
Victoria Police said a bomb specialist had to be brought in to search a car and two bags which were located nearby.
Footage published by Australian outlet 7News showed the suspect being restrained by a passenger, while a member of ground crew and a pilot removed a utility belt containing tools that the suspect was carrying.
The pilot can also be seen kicking the shotgun away from the teen, who is wearing a fluorescent jacket.
""How is this possible?"" someone onboard can be heard saying in the footage.
Victoria Police said the 17-year-old, who is from the nearby Ballarat area, was being held in custody.
Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters that passengers had noticed the teen was carrying a gun as he climbed the steps up to the plane.
""The male was overpowered by three of the passengers, at least,"" he said.
Supt Reid said the local force was in contact with counterterrorism police but that it was too early to establish a motive.
""No doubt this would have been a very terrifying incident for the passengers,"" he said, while commending the ""bravery"" of those who had overpowered the suspect.
Barry Clark, one of the passengers, told Australian public broadcaster ABC that the teen appeared to be dressed like an airport worker and was ""agitated"".
He said: ""All I could do was get the gun out of the way... and then put him in a hold and throw him to the ground until the police came.""
No one was injured during the incident, police said. Investigators located a car and two bags belonging to the suspect nearby.

BBC News, Sydney","Warning: Contains offensive language and descriptions of sexual violence
It was a warm February night when an ominous message popped into Hannah Grundy's inbox in Sydney.
""I will just keep emailing because I think this is worthy of your attention,"" the anonymous sender wrote.
Inside was a link, and a warning in bold: ""[This] contains disturbing material.""
She hesitated for a moment, fearing it was a scam.
The reality was so much worse. The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats.
""You're tied up in them,"" she recalls. ""You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage.""
Written in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out.
That email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards.
The web page was called ""The Destruction of Hannah"", and at the top of it was a poll where hundreds of people had voted on the vicious ways they wanted to abuse her.
Below was a thread of more than 600 vile photos, with Hannah's face stitched on to them. Buried in between them were chilling threats.
""I'm closing in on this slut,"" the main poster said.
""I want to hide in her house and wait until she is alone, grab her from behind and... feel her struggle.""
It's been three years now, but the 35-year-old school teacher has no trouble recalling the ""pure shock"" that coursed through when she and partner Kris Ventura, 33, opened the page.
""You immediately feel unsafe,"" Hannah tells me, eyes wide as she grips a mug of peppermint tea in her living room.
Clicking through the website Kris had also found photos of their close friends, along with images depicting at least 60 other women, many also from Sydney.
The couple quickly realised the pictures used to create the deepfakes were from the women's private social media accounts. And the penny dropped: this was someone they all knew.
Desperate to find out who, Hannah and Kris spent hours at the kitchen table, identifying the women, searching their social media friends lists for a common link, and methodically building a dossier of evidence.
Within four hours, they had a list of three potential suspects.
On it, but immediately discounted, was their close friend from university Andrew Hayler. The trio had met while working at a campus bar, and the staff there quickly formed deep friendships.
And Andy, as they called him - the supervisor - was the glue of the group.
He was considerate and affable, Hannah says - the kind of guy who looked out for women in the bar and made sure his female friends got home safely after a night out.
They all hung out regularly, went on holidays together, loved and trusted each other.
""I thought of him as a very close friend,"" Hannah says.
""We were just so sure that he was a good person.""
But soon they'd whittled down the list to just one name: his.
When Hannah woke the next morning and went to the police station, mingling with her shock and horror was a ""naive"" sliver of optimism.
""We thought they'd go grab him that afternoon,"" Kris says with a wry smile.
Instead, Hannah says she was met with disdain.
She recalls one New South Wales Police officer asking what she'd done to Andy. At one stage they suggested Hannah simply ask him to stop. Later, they pointed to a picture of her in a skimpy outfit and said ""you look cute in this one"", she says.
New South Wales Police declined to comment to the BBC on the specifics of Hannah's case.
But she says the way her complaint was handled made her feel like she was making ""a big deal out of nothing"".
""And for me, it felt quite life-changing,"" says Hannah.
Any faith she still held that police would help quickly dwindled.
Amid delays, she turned to Australia's eSafety Commissioner, but under its powers as a regulatory body it could only offer help in taking the content down.
Desperate, the couple hired a lawyer and commissioned a digital forensics analyst to move things along.
In the meantime, to avoid tipping Andy off and to keep themselves safe, they retreated inwards.
""The world for you just gets smaller. You don't speak to people. You don't really go out,"" Hannah says.
Intense fear and loneliness filled the void instead.
""We'd already had to suspend complete belief to understand that he'd done these things, so [the idea of] him actually coming to try and rape you or hurt you isn't that much of a bigger stretch.""
The couple installed cameras all around their house and set up location tracking on Hannah's devices. She began wearing a health watch 24/7, so someone would know if her heartbeat rose - or ceased.
""I stopped having the windows open because I was scared... maybe someone would come in,"" Hannah explains.
""We slept with a knife in both of our bedside tables because we just thought: 'What if?'""
Still feeling abandoned by police, Kris had taken on the burden of monitoring the site for the slightest sign of escalation towards Hannah and any of their friends - who, to protect the investigation, still did not know anything.
Guilt ate at the pair: ""We had a constant battle about whether it was right to not tell them,"" Hannah says.
At one point told the investigation had been suspended, Hannah and Kris forked out even more money for a detailed forensic report, and threatened to make a formal complaint to the police watchdog. All up, they spent over A$20,000 (£10,200; $12,400) trying to protect themselves and stop Andy.
Finally a new detective was assigned and within two weeks police were raiding Andy's house. He admitted everything.
Filled with relief, then dread, Hannah began calling her friends to break the news.
""My stomach just dropped,"" Jessica Stuart says, recalling the moment she learned what Andy had done to her photos.
""I felt really violated but… I don't think I fully comprehended.""
For her, again, the sucker punch was that a friend who she loved like ""family"" was behind the crime. Andy had always appeared ""so unassuming"" and ""really thoughtful"" - someone she'd called for help through a difficult time.
""It's been really hard to reconcile that those two people are actually the same person.""
The case was uncharted territory for Australia.
For at least a decade, experts have warned advances in technology would lead to a wave of AI crimes. But authorities have been caught on the back foot, leaving deepfake victims - overwhelmingly women - vulnerable.
At the time Andy was arrested in 2022, there was no offence for creating or sharing deepfake pornography in NSW, or anywhere else in Australia, and the country had never seen a case of this magnitude before.
The 39-year-old was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence - a low-level catch-all offence for many internet crimes - and Hannah was warned to keep her expectations low.
""We were prepared to go to court and for him to get a slap on the wrist,"" she says.
But she and the 25 other women who decided to be part of the case were determined Andy be held accountable. One after the other, several gave crushing statements at his sentencing hearing last year.
""You didn't just betray my friendship, but you shattered the sense of safety I used to take for granted,"" Jess told the court. ""The world feels unfamiliar and dangerous, I am constantly anxious, I have nightmares when I am able to sleep.
""Forming new friendships feels impossible, burdened by the constant question: 'Could this person be like you?'""
When it came time for Andy to apologise to the women he'd targeted, Jess and Hannah couldn't stomach being in the room. They walked out.
""There is nothing that he can say to me that makes it better, and I wanted him to know that,"" Hannah says.
Andy told the court that creating the images had felt ""empowering"" as ""an outlet"" for a ""dark"" part of his psyche, but that he didn't think they would cause real harm.
""I have really done a terrible thing and I am so very sorry,"" he said.
Judge Jane Culver was not convinced of his remorse, saying while there was ""some contrition"", he didn't seem to understand the clearly ""profound and ongoing"" suffering that his ""prolific"" and ""disturbing"" offending had caused.
She sentenced Andy to nine years in jail - in what has been called a landmark decision.
""The gasp that went through the court... it was such a relief,"" Jess says.
""It was the first time I felt like we had actually been listened to.""
Andy will be eligible for parole in December 2029, but has told the court he intends to challenge his sentence.
Nicole Shackleton, a law expert who researches technology and gender, told the BBC the ""unprecedented"" case set a surprising, and significant, legal standard for future cases.
The judge had recognised ""this wasn't merely something that happened online"" and that such behaviour was ""tied to offline violence against women"", said Dr Shackleton, from Melbourne's RMIT University.
But Australia and other countries remain poor at regulating the use of AI and proactively investigating its misuse, experts like her argue.
Australia has recently criminalised the creation and sharing of deepfake pornography at a national level. But many other countries have legislation accused of containing loopholes, or do not criminalise deepfake pornography at all. In the UK, sharing it is an offence, but creating or soliciting it is not - though this is about to change.
And in the face of under-trained and under-resourced police forces, many victims like Hannah or private investigators - like the one who tipped her off - are left to be de facto detectives and regulators.
In a statement, NSW Police said investigations into AI crimes are a challenging, ""resource and time intensive process"", and training has recently been beefed up ""with the goal that every officer... can respond to these types of crimes effectively"".
The force also works with the eSafety Commissioner and tech companies to take down deepfake abuse, the statement added.
eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said removal of the distressing material is the top priority for most victim-survivors, and eSafety had ""an extremely high success rate in achieving it"".
But eSafety does not have the punitive powers to pursue criminal investigations and penalties, she added in a statement to the BBC.
""You can have whatever laws you like, [but] if you have a police force that are incompetent..."" Kris says, trailing off.
""We're obviously angry at Andy. But it is also disgusting that the only way you get justice with something like this is if you're two people in your 30s that can afford to bully the police.""
They're determined for things to be different for future victims. In the past six months alone, two schoolboys in separate cases in NSW and Victoria have been reported to police for allegedly creating mass deepfake nudes of their classmates.
After several years of hell, Hannah is also trying to move on.
But Andy's looming appeal threatens the hard work she's done to rebuild her life and mental health.
Knees at her chest and feet tucked under her on the couch, she says Andy got the sentence he deserved.
""Because for me, and for the other girls, it is forever… they will always be on the internet,"" she says.
She still pays for a service which scours the web for the pictures, and she worries about future friends, employers, students - her own children - finding them.
One of her biggest fears is that her best memories will never be reclaimed.
""You post things on Facebook and Instagram because they're the happiest moments of your life. You get a dog, you buy a house, you get engaged and you post a photo.
""He had turned every single one of those moments for us into porn. And so when you see that photo… well, now I see myself getting raped.""

Sam Kerr may have been found not guilty of causing racially aggravated harassment but that is not the end of the story for one of women's football's most high-profile players.
There is a lingering question over how much lasting damage it will have on her reputation and career.
After the case, the Australia and Chelsea player apologised ""for expressing myself poorly on what was a traumatic evening"".
The trial heard Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis had been out drinking when they were driven to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi driver who complained that they had refused to pay clean-up costs after Kerr was sick, and Mewis had smashed the vehicle's rear window.
Kerr said she and her partner had feared for their lives and in an expletive-laden exchange, accused one of the police officers of being ""stupid and white"".

Kerr was supported by her parents and brother Levi throughout the case. Her fiancee Mewis was in the public gallery once she had finished giving evidence as a witness for the defence.
When the verdict was read out, Kerr did not show much emotion while Mewis was in tears in the public gallery. But when court broke, Kerr gave an enthusiastic thumbs up to her barrister, Grace Forbes.
Carly Telford (left, celebrating Chelsea winning the FA Cup in 2021) appeared as a character witness for Kerr in court
When it came to character evidence, Kerr had the support of high-profile figures in the world of football as well as family and friends including former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes and captain Millie Bright, who provided written references.
Ex-Chelsea and England goalkeeper Carly Telford was the only character witness to give evidence in court, and said that while her former team-mate was ""exuberant"" on the pitch, she was ""quite shy and humble"" off it.
Kerr herself acknowledged that being reminded of her behaviour on the night in question was ""embarrassing"", and apologised in court and again in her post-trial statement for the way she had expressed herself.
The significance of this court case was not lost on Kerr or those associated with her.
Chelsea had a legal representative in court for the entirety of it, and Kerr made additions to her public relations team in advance of the trial getting under way.
Tim Crow, a sports marketing expert, said: ""There are plenty of precedents for athletes coming back from controversies like this, and taking their careers to new heights.
""There are two critical factors for Sam Kerr going forward. The first is her performance on the field: everything flows from that. The second is how she chooses to portray herself off the field, in her own voice through the media to control the narrative, or through sponsors.
""On the latter, it will be interesting to see how her existing sponsors react, and if any new sponsors come forward to back her, as she is now on the front line of the culture wars, at least for the time being.""
BBC Sport has contacted Kerr's personal sponsors - Nike, Commbank and Australian mobile phone service Mate - for comment.
Kerr was accompanied by partner Kristie Mewis (left) throughout the trial in London
It remains to be seen how supporters react when Kerr returns to the pitch for the first time following this trial.
Kerr has been the subject of abuse previously, including homophobia.
The announcement she is expecting a child with Mewis drew homophobic comments online, which were condemned by Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor.
Blues supporters groups have celebrated the verdict, with Chelsea Pride among those to post online tributes
, external
to Kerr on Tuesday.
Chelsea have not yet made any comment about the case.
There was significant media interest in this case for the duration, not just among British media but Australian media.
The public gallery was so full that the court had to find extra seats for reporters, and each day there was a large number of camera crews and reporters filming and photographing Kerr's arrival at and departure from court.
Kerr is arguably the most famous sportswoman in Australia, having been the face of the Matildas' home World Cup in 2023 in which they came fourth.
Her status has seen Kerr become a symbol of Australia around the world outside of sport, and she was the national flag bearer at the coronation of King Charles III.
Following the outcome of the trial, Football Australia welcomed Kerr's statement, and spoke of her importance to the team.
""Sam has been a key figure in Australian football for many years, and we recognise the significant pressures that this matter has brought to everyone involved,"" the statement read.
Football Australia said it would ""reflect with Sam on learnings from this matter"", but stopped short of details, including whether Kerr would remain captain.
Reaction from the Australian public, when the BBC spoke to people on Bondi Beach in Sydney on Wednesday, was more mixed.
""I think people would make mistakes,"" said one person. ""She's in the limelight and she has been a great role model for young girls. It's important for her to keep that, with everything she has done for female football in Australia.""
""She obviously let herself down,"" said another. ""I'm a bit surprised she has got away with it like she has. We'll see what comes from this for Chelsea and Australia I guess.""
The front page of Australian newspaper The Courier Mail on Wednesday 12 February
The not guilty verdict has not spared Kerr from criticism in the Australian media either.
Erin Smith, football writer for the Australian newspaper, said Kerr's behaviour was ""unacceptable"" for someone in a prominent leadership role.
""Football Australia needs to take a hard-line stance and send a message to the millions of Matildas fans that behaviour like this will not be swept under the rug and forgotten about,"" she wrote on Wednesday.
Alex Blair wrote for news.com.au that Kerr ""could be facing an even bigger mountain to climb after her dramatic legal saga"", and that she faced losing a chunk of her annual income - she earned a reported Aus$3.3m (£1.67m) in 2022 - if brands dropped her as a representative.
Writing for The Guardian Australia, Kieran Pender described the trial as ""a Rorschach test, enabling observers to reach their own conclusions about the Matildas star well before a verdict was reached"".
""Even before the verdict, it was clear that things will not be the same for Kerr, or Australian football, moving forward,"" he wrote. ""The extent to which this incident tarnishes a glittering career, or is relegated to a footnote, remains to be seen.""
Sam Kerr has been a visible presence around Chelsea despite her injury and the trial
Kerr remains a key figure for club and country, with both Chelsea and Australia keen to see her back on the pitch as soon as possible.
Now 31, Kerr made her senior international debut aged just 15 and has scored 69 goals in 128 appearances for the Matildas.
In 2019 she joined Chelsea, and was a key player in establishing them as the dominant WSL force under former manager Emma Hayes, winning five league titles.
She finished third in the Ballon d'Or Feminin voting in 2021 and 2022, then second in 2023. A ""big-game player"", she scored five goals in three successive FA Cup finals between 2021 and 2023, all won by Chelsea.
Kerr has not played since the end of 2023, suffering a serious knee injury during a winter training camp with Chelsea in January 2024.

BBC News
Reporting fromSingapore","Sam Jones, a US influencer who briefly snatched a baby wombat from its distressed mother, and uploaded the footage to social media has left Australia.
Australia's Home Affairs minister Tony Burke had earlier said his department was reviewing whether it could revoke Ms Jones's visa, but the BBC understands that she left the country of her own accord.
""There has never been a better time to be a baby wombat,"" Burke said in a short statement on Friday celebrating Jones's departure.
Anger erupted across Australia after Jones posted a video of her taking a baby wombat from the side of a road while laughing and running away from the distraught mother wombat.
The video also shows the baby wombat hissing in distress before Jones then returns it to the bush.
Jones, who also goes by the name Samantha Strable, has nearly 100,000 followers and describes herself as an ""outdoor enthusiast and hunter"" on her Instagram profile. She has since made her account private and deleted her post.
Her video was swiftly met with widespread condemnation, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calling the incident an ""outrage"".
Foreign Minister Penny Wong called the video ""dreadful"".
On Friday, opposition leader Peter Dutton said he thought it was ""a cruel act"" and that he was ""glad"" the influencer has now left.
An online petition demanding Jones be deported from Australia garnered more than 30,000 signatures.
However, as Jones had not been charged nor been deemed a threat to the country – the government may not have had any grounds to cancel her visa.
In since-deleted comments, Jones said ""the baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom"".
""They wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed,"" she wrote. ""I don't ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so.""
But wildlife experts have deemed Jones's act a ""blatant disregard"" for native wildlife.
The Wombat Protection Society said it was shocked to see the ""mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for 'social media likes'"".
Suzanne Milthorpe, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection Australia, told BBC Newsday that posting such a video for ""cheap content"" was ""unacceptable"".
""To that baby it must have seemed like a giant predator was picking it up and taking it away,"" she said.
Wombats, which are native to Australia, are a legally protected species across the country. Baby wombats share a strong bond with their mothers, and any separation can be distressing and harmful, conservationists say.
A new TikTok account claiming to be Jones after her original account was allegedly banned, published a post on Thursday saying that ""the hate is currently too much for me to handle"" and that there had been ""hundreds"" of death threats.
""Imagine someone just goes up to your child and curses at them? Let's have some respect,"" the post said.
Most, however, have remained critical of Jones's act.
""Maybe imagine if someone picked up your child and laughed while you screamed for them to give them back,"" read a comment under the post, a reference to Jones's snatching of the wombat from its mother.",Australia

BBC News","Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is the latest to criticise a US influencer whose video of her taking a wild baby wombat away from its distressed mother has angered conservationists.
Albanese suggested that the woman, Sam Jones, tries doing so with animals that ""can actually fight back"": ""Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.""
Ms Jones, who calls herself an ""outdoor enthusiast and hunter"", was filmed picking up the joey by the road and running across it to a car, while its mother ran after them.
The man filming can be heard laughing: ""Look at the mother, it's chasing after her!"" The video, which was filmed in Australia, has since been deleted.
Immigration officials are reviewing Ms Jones's visa, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told the BBC, following calls for her to be deported.
An online petition supporting Ms Jones's deportation has received 10,500 signatures so far.
""Given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,"" Burke said in a statement.
Ms Jones's ""appalling"" behaviour could have caused severe harm to the wombats, conservationists say.
The Wombat Protection Society said it was shocked to see the ""mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for 'social media likes'"".
""[She] then placed the vulnerable baby back onto a country road - potentially putting it at risk of becoming roadkill,"" it noted in its statement, adding that it remains unclear if the joey reunited with its mother.
""I caught a baby wombat,"" Ms Jones exclaimed in the video, while the joey could be heard hissing and struggling in her grip.
Her caption in the now-deleted post read: ""My dream of holding a wombat has been realised! Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush.""
""The baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom,"" she wrote in the comments, responding to criticism.
""They wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed. I don't ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so.""
Following the backlash, Ms Jones, who has more than 92,000 followers on Instagram, made her account private. But several media outlets had already shared the video - as well as earlier posts, said to be taken in Australia, which show her holding an echidna and a ""little shark"".
Wombats, which are native to Australia, are a legally protected species across the country. Baby wombats share a strong bond with their mothers, and any separation can be distressing and harmful, conservationists say.
""Wombats are not a photo prop or plaything,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection Australia, in a statement online.
""It's just unacceptable, and we're glad she's being called to account. Snatching a screaming baby wombat from their mother is not just appalling, it's very possibly illegal under state or national laws,"" Ms Milthrope said.
Some experts believe Ms Jones broke the law because Australia prohibits people from harming or taking native wildlife.
It is only allowed if the joey is in need of help because its mother has died, wildlife veterinarian Tania Bishop told ABC News.
Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong also weighed in on the ""dreadful"" video.
""I think everyone who would have seen that would have thought, leave the baby wombat alone. Leave it with its mum,"" she told 7News.

Australia correspondent
Reporting fromSouthern Queensland","A tropical storm is expected to make landfall on Australia's eastern coast on Saturday morning as tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and more than 230,000 households left without power.
Initially called Cyclone Alfred, the weather front was downgraded to a tropical low with winds set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast.
The Bureau of Meteorology said the storm is currently sitting off Bribie Island and is moving slowly north, and expected to cross the mainland coast between the island and Maroochydore.
Authorities are still warning people to stay indoors, with fines for those who visit beaches, as heavy rain and flooding is still expected.
On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology, said there is an ongoing risk of widespread severe weather, especially rainfall.
""Our 24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days as that system slows and moves inland,"" she told ABC News Breakfast.
""The rain is still coming through in full force, and we're still seeing widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well,"" she added.
The ex-tropical cyclone has already caused flooding which authorities fear could worsen over the weekend. New South Wales police said on Friday that one man was missing after his vehicle was swept into a fast-flowing river.
Four million people across Queensland and northern New South Wales are in the firing line of the storm.
But its slow progress, described by weather experts as ""walking pace"" and ""erratic"", has raised concerns of flash and riverine flooding in low-lying areas.
Stephen Valentine and his wife, who live in Logan city south of Brisbane, have prepared some 30 litres of water, food for themselves and their pets, and set up ""protected rooms"" in their home situated away from windows.
""At the moment we are as prepared as we can be for something that none of us have been through... Nothing has come this far south across the south,"" said Mr Valentine, who grew up in the city.
""We would get the edge of a cyclone ever so often, but not to this level,"" he added.
While Queensland isn't a stranger to cyclones – it's the most disaster-prone state in Australia – it's rare they come so far south.
""These are tough times, but Australians are tough people, and we are resilient people,"" said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday, echoing the Gold Coast's acting Mayor Donna Gates, who has said Cyclone Alfred is a ""scary proposition"" for the region.
Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Flights aren't expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled.
The last time a cyclone hit was in 1974, when Wanda hit in January and then two months later, Zoe crossed the coast.
Flooding though, is more common. In February 2022, thousands of homes were damaged along much of Australia's east after heavy rain.
Authorities have been keen to prepare communities ahead of Cyclone Alfred. The council opened sandbag depots across the region to help residents protect their homes.
""It's surreal. We know it's coming, but it's very quiet,"" said Anthony Singh, a resident of the Brisbane suburb of West End. He waited for four hours on Wednesday to pick up sandbags to protect his home.
Fellow resident Mark Clayton, helped to co-ordinate the sandbag collection, shovelling more than 140 tonnes of sand.
""I think people are a bit apprehensive,"" he says. ""Are the buildings going to stay up, are the roofs going to stay on? People expect a lot of trees to come down and to lose power for an extended period of time.""
With supermarkets now shut and people mostly sheltering at home, there's a lot of uncertainty as Australians wait for the storm to hit.
But some die-hard surfers have thrown caution to the increasing wind.
""This is what we look forward to,"" said surfer Jeff Weatherall as he waited for a jet ski to pick him up from Kirra beach and carry him into the big waves. ""This is the fifth day straight - I've done nothing but eat, sleep, surf and do it again.""
Kirra beach is famous for its breakers and surfers have been busy this week seizing the strong winds.
""There are people that are going to lose their houses, but at the moment, you're taking the good of it all. This is just crazy surf,"" said surfer Donnie Neal.
Meanwhile Albanese have warned people to take the cyclone warnings seriously.
""This isn't a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it's like to experience these conditions firsthand,"" he said.
""Please stay safe. Be sensible.""

""There have been so many amazing times and wonderful memories. Winning two World Cups was a great highlight along with the many fantastic team-mates who shared the journey,"" said Smith, Australian men's ODI player of the year in 2015 and 2021.
""Now is a great opportunity for people to start preparing for the 2027 ODI World Cup so it feels like the right time to make way.
""Test cricket remains a priority and I am really looking forward to the World Test Championship final, the West Indies in the winter and then England at home. I feel I still have a lot to contribute on that stage.""
Smith hit the winning boundary as Australia beat New Zealand in the 2015 ODI World Cup final at the MCG.
He also played a key role eight years later as Australia upset hots India to win the tournament for a sixth time.
Smith finishes his ODI career with 5,800 runs, at an average of 43.28.
His highest score of 164 came against New Zealand at the SCG in 2016.
Matthew Henry, BBC Sport journalist in Dubai
Smith gave no hint at retirement in his news conference after defeat by India, but this decision is no surprise. He will be 38 by the time the next 50-over World Cup comes around in 2027.
He will go down as one of the great cricketers of his era, although still probably more for his Test exploits despite being a two-time World Cup winner.
A recent resurgence in red-ball cricket suggests he can continue there for a few years yet, beyond this winter's Ashes against England.
This retirement will give an early hint at the future of the Australia after their current crop - Mitchell Starc, Glenn Maxwell and Josh Hazlewood are 34 or older - move on.
Expect 21-year-old Cooper Connolly, who came in against India after injury to Matt Short, to be given opportunities.

BBC News, Sydney","A second Sydney nurse who allegedly appeared in a video that made threats towards Israeli patients has been charged by police.
Ahmad Rashad Nadir, 27, and Sarah Abu Lebdeh, 26, were both suspended from their duties at Bankstown Hospital in February after the video was released online. It was filmed on an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a chat.
Authorities say there is ""no evidence"" the pair actually harmed patients.
Mr Nadir was charged on Wednesday with using a carriage service to threaten, menace or harass, and with possessing a prohibited drug.
Carriage services refer to modern communication systems such as phones and the internet.
Ms Lebdeh was charged last week with three offences: threatening violence to a group, using a carriage service to threaten to kill, and using a carriage service to harass or cause offence.
Neither person has entered a plea to the charges, but Mr Nadir apologised last month through his lawyer.
In the footage, which appeared to have been filmed inside a hospital and was published by an Israeli content creator, Ms Abu Lebdeh and Mr Nadir allegedly bragged about refusing to treat Israeli patients, killing them, and said they would go to hell.
The video spread widely online and caused public outcry, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese describing it as ""disgusting"" and ""vile"".

BBC News","An adventurer who tried to row across the Pacific Ocean from the United States to Australia has been rescued just days before he reached his final destination.
Lithuanian rower Aurimas Mockus sounded a distress signal late on Friday after he was stranded by a cyclone, and surrounded by towering waves and strong winds packing up to 100 km/h (62 mph), local media reported.
Authorities made radio contact with Mr Mockus the next day when he was about 740km east of Mackay, a city on Australia's east coast in the Coral Sea.
By the time he was rescued on Monday morning, the 44-year-old had spent nearly five months alone at sea.
Mr Mockus is getting medical treatment on an Australian warship, which will take him to Sydney, the Australian navy said.
He was attempting to become one of few rowers who have crossed the Pacific alone and without stopping.
Among them are Britons Peter Bird and John Beeden, who achieved the feat in 1983 and 2015 respectively, and Australian Michelle Lee in 2023.
Mr Mockus started his 12,000km-long journey in October from San Diego in southern California. Brisbane was meant to be his destination.
He rowed for an average of 12 hours a day, according to local reports.
He regularly updated his progress on Instagram. In the latest post published a day before he called for help, Mr Mockus reported that he had crossed the Chesterfield Islands, a cluster of French coral islands about 1,500km east of Australia.
""The highlight is that I successfully sailed the reefs of Chesterfield Islands. And further as God allows... The most important thing is to hold back the next few days,"" he wrote.

BBC News","One of the world's most prolific blood donors - whose plasma saved the lives of more than two million babies - has died.
James Harrison died in his sleep at a nursing home in New South Wales, Australia on 17 February, his family said on Monday. He was 88.
Known in Australia as the man with the golden arm, Harrison's blood contained a rare antibody, Anti-D, which is used to make medication given to pregnant mothers whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies.
The Australian Red Cross Blood Service who paid tribute to Harrison, said he had pledged to become a donor after receiving transfusions while undergoing a major chest surgery when he was 14.
He started donating his blood plasma when he was 18 and continued doing so every two weeks until he was 81.
In 2005, he had the world record for most blood plasma donated - a title he held until 2022 when he was overtaken by a man in the US.
Harrison's daughter, Tracey Mellowship, said her father was ""very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain"".
""He always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own,"" she said.
Mellowship and two of Harrison's grandchildren are also recipients of anti-D immunisations.
""It made [James] happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness,"" she said.
Anti-D jabs protect unborn babies from a deadly blood disorder called haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn, or HDFN.
The condition occurs at pregnancy when the mother's red blood cells are incompatible with that of their growing baby.
The mother's immune system then sees the baby's blood cells as a threat and produces antibodies to attack them. This can seriously harm the baby, causing severe anaemia, heart failure, or even death.
Before anti-D interventions were developed in the mid-1960s, one in two babies diagnosed with HDFN died.
It is unclear how Harrison's blood came to be so rich in anti-D, but some reports said it had to do with the massive blood transfusion he received at 14.
There are fewer than 200 anti-D donors in Australia, but they help an estimated 45,000 mothers and their babies every year, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood.
Lifeblood has been working with Australia's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research to grow anti-D antibodies in the lab by replicating blood and immune cells from Harrison and other donors.
Researchers involved hope lab-made anti-D can one day be used to help pregnant women worldwide.
""Creating a new therapy has long been a 'holy grail',"" Lifeblood's research director David Irving said.
He noted the scarcity of donors committed to regular donation, who are able to produce antibodies in sufficient quality and quantity.",Australia

Australia left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann has had his bowling action cleared by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
The 28-year-old, who has played nine times for Australia, was reported for a suspect action during the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle earlier this month.
Subsequent independent testing has shown the bend in his elbow falls within the permitted 15 degrees, leaving him free to continue bowling.
""It was a disappointing way to finish what was such a successful Test series for Australia,"" Kuhnemann said in a statement on Thursday.
""I've never doubted my bowling action throughout my career and I'm always looking to improve the art of spin bowling in different conditions.
""I appreciated the professional manner in which testing was explained to me and then conducted.""

""It has been a challenging period for Matt. However, he has carried himself exceptionally well.
""He has had the full support of Australian cricket and he can now move forward to the next phase of his international career with great confidence.""

BBC News","An Australian couple have spoken of the ""traumatic"" moment the body of a dead passenger was placed next to them on a Qatar Airways flight.
Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a dream holiday, told Australia's Channel 9 a woman had died in the aisle beside them during the flight from Melbourne to Doha.
The couple say cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him, despite there being empty seats.
Qatar Airways said it apologised for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"".
The couple said they had not been contacted or offered support by Qatar Airways or Qantas, the airline through which they booked the flight.
In a later statement on Wednesday, Qatar Airways said it had now spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns, as well as the family of the woman who died.
Mr Ring told Channel Nine's Current Affair programme that staff had responded ""in no time"" when the woman collapsed, but that ""unfortunately the lady couldn't be saved, which was pretty heart-breaking to watch"".
He said the cabin crew had tried to move her body towards business class ""but she was quite a large lady and they couldn't get her through the aisle"".
Mr Ring said the crew had seen seats were available beside him.
""They said, 'Can you move over please?' and I just said, 'Yes no problem'.
""Then they placed the lady in the chair I was in.""
While Ms Colin was able to move to an empty seat nearby, Mr Ring said he had not been given the option to do so by cabin crew - even though there were vacant seats.
When the plane landed four hours later, he said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board.
He said ambulance officers had then started pulling blankets off the woman and he had seen her face.
The couple said there needed to be a ""duty of care"" for customers and staff.
""We should be contacted to make sure, do you need some support, do you need some counselling?""
Ms Colin called the experience ""traumatic"" and said: ""We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board.""
In its latest statement, Qatar Airways said: ""We have been in contact with the family of the passenger who passed away to express our condolences on their loss. We have also directly spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns.
""The safety and comfort of all our passengers is of paramount importance to us.""
A Qantas spokesperson said: ""The process for handling incidents onboard an aircraft like this is managed by the operating airline, which in this case is Qatar Airways.""
Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, said deaths in the air ""occur more frequently than people would think"" but said as a far as he was aware there was no specific protocol in place for such situations.
""On a long haul flight it tends to depend largely on when it occurs and where it occurs and what the crew have in terms of facilities to place the body somewhere because on an aeroplane, there's no access to the hold, there's a crew rest area but that's for the crew so it can be problematical.""
A toilet area or galley area could be blocked off, he said, but the crew are required to keep a certain number of toilets available.
Mr Eustance said that, while he was not being judgemental as he did not know the full situation, he was surprised that the crew did not move Mr Ring if there had been spare seats.
""I would expect the crew would do all they could to avoid that. You are creating potential future liabilities in terms of the trauma of the people next to whom the body was placed,"" he said.
""In my experience the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons. You have a dead body that is uncontained and all that goes with it.""",Australia

BBC News","The parents of an eight-year-old diabetic girl in Australia who died after they denied her insulin for almost a week have each been sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter.
Elizabeth Struhs had in 2019 been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections.
Her parents belonged to a religious sect known as The Saints, who opposed medical care, believing God would heal her.
She died from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes at her home in Toowoomba west of Brisbane in January 2022.
Her father Jason Struhs and mother Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter last month.
The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens has been jailed for 13 years by the judge at the Supreme Court of Queensland, who called him a ""dangerous, highly manipulative individual"".
Eleven other members were handed jail terms of six to nine years.
Stevens and the girl's father had been on trial for murder but they were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty.
When handing down his almost 500-page verdict last month, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death.
""Due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive.""
Elizabeth would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness because she was denied medical care, prosecutor Caroline Marco said during the trial, which lasted several months and was heard by a judge sitting alone without a jury.
Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days.
The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for the girl as she lay on a mattress and her condition deteriorated.
Believing she could be brought back to life, the sect member made no effort to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, the court heard.
""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" her father Jason Struhs had earlier told the court.
Stevens, 63, had defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"".
Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin.
Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs had earlier said she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them.
She and other witnesses described the congregation as having strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals.
The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and count around two dozen members from three families among its members.",Australia

BBC News, Brisbane","An Australian radio presenter has left the network after comments he made about the country's women's football team – which have been branded as misogynist and disrespectful.
Marty Sheargold said on nationwide radio station Triple M that the Matildas players reminded him of ""year 10 girls"" and implied that their matches were boring.
He apologised earlier on Wednesday, and was due to be back on air but did not appear in his usual time slot.
Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of Triple M, later said Sheargold and the station had agreed to ""mutually part ways"".
In a statement on Wednesday, Sheargold said that he fully understood the gravity of his remarks and would like to ""sincerely apologise to the Matildas and the broader organisation"".
The company said that it ""takes its responsibility to listeners, shareholders, and clients seriously and its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience.""
""Right now, it's clear this is a moment for reflection and review. Triple M, and the wider SCA network, will continue to take all necessary steps to support staff,"" the firm's chief content officer Dave Cameron said in a statement.
Earlier the sport's governing body said the remarks ""diminish the extraordinary achievements"" of a team that were semi-finalists in the women's world cup in 2023.
During his drivetime show on Monday afternoon, Sheargold interjected during a sports bulletin - which was discussing Australia's defeat to the US in its second consecutive loss in the SheBelieves Cup.
""You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls,"" Sheargold said, to the laughter of his co-hosts.
""All the infighting and all the friendship issues... Now I'm sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that's what I think of it.""
When his colleague mentioned the SheBelieves Cup by name, Sheargold interrupted saying: ""Oh, she believes in what? It better be men.""
And when reference was made to Australia hosting the AFC Women's Asian Cup next year, he said ""oh god - the Asian Cup"", before criticising the event with an obscene comment. He then asked his co-host: ""Got any men's sport?""
Sheargold's comments later went viral.
Minister for Sport Anika Wells called the comments ""boorish, boring and wrong"".
""Australia's most watched television event ever was the Matildas World Cup semi-final; the Tillies' quarterfinal is the second-most-watched event in Australian history,"" Ms Wells said.
Australian Olympian Ambrosia Malone, who represents her country in hockey, also criticised Sheargold.
""All I could think about was the young girls sitting in the car with their parents, maybe on the way to or from their own training sessions hearing this,"" she wrote on social media.
""I'm sure many of them would have been hurt and confused… I was in disbelief.
""This is apparently acceptable on mainstream afternoon radio??? HOW??""
Football Australia said it was ""deeply disappointed by the unacceptable comments"" which ""fail to recognise the profound impact they have had on Australian sport and society"".
""This incident is a stark reminder of the responsibility media outlets and personalities have in fostering respectful and constructive discussions about women's sport and its participants,"" it added.",Australia

Without specifying a reason, Amazon confirmed the series will finish at the end of 2025 - 40 years and more than 9,000 episodes after its television debut.
It was dropped by Channel 5 in 2022, but revived by Amazon for its streaming platforms just four months after a star-studded farewell episode watched by millions.
The soap - which helped launched the careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie - has long been a huge hit with Australian and UK audiences, and last year received its first Emmy nomination.
A statement on the show's social media said the soap would be ""resting"" from December.
""Audiences all around the world have loved and embraced Neighbours for four decades and we are very proud of the huge success over the last two years,"" executive producer Jason Herbison wrote.
""We value how much the fans love Neighbours and we believe there are more stories of the residents of Ramsay Street to tell in the future,"" Mr Hebrison added, hinting that the producers will again hunt for a new backer.
New episodes will continue to air on Amazon Prime Video and Australia's Channel Ten four times a week until the end of 2025.
In a statement, Amazon MGM Studios said it was ""proud"" to have played ""a small part"" in Neighbours history.
""Forty years is an incredible milestone,"" a spokesperson said.
Fans vented their disappointment at the decision.
One wrote on social media: ""I refuse point blank to accept that they will try to take @neighbours from me AGAIN!!! It's sometimes the only 20 minutes in the day I can escape. Absolutely blooming well not!!""
Someone else wrote: ""I can't begin to count the number of times I've logged into @primevideouk to be greeted by #Neighbours sitting at the top of the weekly charts.

Set and filmed in Melbourne, Neighbours was first broadcast in Australia in 1985 and launched on BBC One a year later.

It also had its controversies, however. A number of actors recently came forward with racism allegations, prompting production company Fremantle Media to promise a review.
News of the show's cancellation comes after actor Ian Smith - who plays Ramsay Street stalwart Harold Bishop - last year announced he would leave the show, revealing he has terminal cancer.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz65p1k45o,"Children routinely using social media, Australian regulator says",2025-02-20T14:31:30.425Z,"Graham Fraser
Technology Reporter","More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.
It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.
The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.
The regulator accused the apps of ""a lack of robust interventions"" for checking the ages of their users.
The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube.
Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.
For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.
In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.
It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.
""The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,"" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant.
Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users.
In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram - took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. ""This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,"" said a TikTok spokesperson.
""Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.""
A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies.
Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.
They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.
Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.
The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.
If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.
""These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,"" the report's authors said.
""However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account.""
The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.
Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.
""Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,"" the report said.
""This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms.""",Australia

The woman from Pascoe Vale suburb is due in court on Wednesday, where it will be alleged that she targeted the two victims on 13 February because of their head coverings, local media report.
She allegedly grabbed and choked a 30-year-old pregnant woman using the latter's hijab at Epping shopping centre before pushing and slapping another 26-year-old woman in a separate assault 10 minutes later.
This comes two weeks after the country passed tough new laws against hate crimes following a recent string of high-profile antisemitic attacks.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday condemned the incident as ""reprehensible"". He rejected criticism that his government was taking Islamophobic attacks less seriously compared to antisemitic attacks.
""I take all attacks on people on the basis of their faith seriously, and they should all face the full force of the law,"" he told reporters.
Melbourne police say they are investigating reports of online threats against one of the two victims in the shopping centre. Both suffered non-life-threatening injuries.
On Tuesday, Australia's anti-Islamophobia envoy, Aftab Malik, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that ""all forms of hate need to stop"" and that the country's leaders must condemn the incident in Melbourne.
Earlier in the week, the president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Rateb Jneid, expressed alarm over attacks on Muslims in the country and called the government's response ""grossly insufficient"".
Australia's government has described new laws passed in early February as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"".
It imposes mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years for the use of hate symbols such as the Nazi salute.
The reforms come as attacks on Jewish targets have become a topic of fierce debate in the country.

BBC News, Sydney","Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.
A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.
They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.
Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.
False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.
Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.
Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.
""There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.""
""It's just absolutely horrific.""
The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.
""This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,"" he said.
""We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.""
Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.
""The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,"" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.
With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the ""tough"" and ""confronting"" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.
""The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,"" Dr Carlyon said.
That grim task - which involves shooting the animals - is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.
Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested ""it may be a case of... letting nature run its course"".
Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.
More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.
Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.
Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.
There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.
Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.

Australia spinner Matthew Kuhnemann has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action.
The 28-year-old was Australia's leading wicket-taker in their 2-0 Test series win in Sri Lanka but was reported following the second Test in Galle.
Kuhnemann will now have his action assessed to determine its legality and, if deemed illegal, the left-armer would be suspended from bowling until his action has been modified and passed a further assessment.
""The Australian team was notified of the match officials' referral following the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle and will support Matt through the process of clearing this matter,"" Cricket Australia said in a statement.
""This is the first time in eight years of professional cricket that his action been questioned.
""Cricket Australia will liaise closely with the ICC (International Cricket Council) and independent experts in line with ICC regulations.""
The ICC says in its rules and regulations
, external
that an illegal bowling action is ""where a player is throwing rather than bowling the ball"".
This is defined by the ICC as being ""where the player's elbow extends by an amount of more than 15 degrees between their arm reaching the horizontal and the ball being released"".
Kuhnemann is free to continue bowling in domestic cricket for Tasmania but is not permitted to bowl at international level until his action is cleared.

Australia seamer Mitchell Starc has opted out of the Champions Trophy.
It continues a disruptive build-up for the two-time winners, who had already lost captain Pat Cummins, seamer Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh to injury, plus the sudden ODI retirement of all-rounder Marcus Stoinis.
Starc, 35, will not be sharing a reason for his decision and has asked for privacy.
The left-armer, who has taken 244 wickets in 127 one-day internationals, was the only Australia seamer to play in all seven Tests against India at home and Sri Lanka away between November and February.
It leaves Spencer Johnson, Nathan Ellis, Sean Abbott and Ben Dwarshuis, who have played in 37 ODIs between them, as Australia's frontline pace options.
""We understand and respect Mitch's decision,"" chair selector George Bailey said.
""Mitch is deeply respected for his commitment to international cricket and the priority he places on performing for Australia.
""His well-documented ability to play through pain and adversity, as well as forgoing opportunities in other parts of his career to put his country first should be applauded.
""His loss is of course a blow for the Champions Trophy campaign but does provide an opportunity for someone else to make a mark on the tournament.""
Steve Smith has been appointed captain ahead of Travis Head in Cummins' absence.

BBC News","Two Australian nurses have been suspended after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them.
The man and woman - both employees at a Sydney hospital - are now being investigated by police, officials in New South Wales (NSW) said.
State Health Minister Ryan Park said that a ""thorough investigation"" would be carried out to make sure there had been ""no adverse [patient] outcomes"", but that a ""rapid"" examination of hospital records had not turned up anything unusual.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the video as ""sickening and shameful"" after it began circulating online.
It comes less than a week after Australia passed tougher laws against hate crimes following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks.
On Wednesday, NSW Police said that they believed they had ""identified the individuals involved"" in the video.
The health minister said both had been stood down immediately, and promised that they would never work in the NSW healthcare system again.
The video was shared on TikTok by content creator Max Veifer, who says he is from Israel.
His account features conversations with people he encounters on the app Chatruletka - an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a video chat.
The footage, seen by the BBC, appears to have been recorded in a hospital.
A man, who claims to be a doctor, tells Mr Veifer that he ""has beautiful eyes"" but adds ""I'm sorry you're Israeli"" before saying he sends Israelis to Jahannam - an Islamic place akin to hell.
He goes on to make a throat-slitting gesture, before a woman comes on screen and says that ""one day"" Mr Veifer's ""time will come"" and that he will die, later adding that she won't treat Israelis.
""I won't treat them, I will kill them,"" she says.
The video has been edited, emojis have been added, and some comments have been bleeped out - but authorities are not questioning its authenticity.
Albanese described it as ""disgusting"" and ""vile"", writing on X: ""These antisemitic comments, driven by hate, have no place in our health system and no place anywhere in Australia.
""Individuals found to have committed criminal antisemitic acts will face the full force of our laws.""
Park also apologised to the Jewish community, and said he wanted to reassure them that they could still expect ""first class"" health care in NSW.
""There is no place in our hospital and health system for this sort of view to ever, ever take place. There is no place for this sort of perspective in our society.""
He added that staff at the hospital in the suburb of Bankstown were embarrassed and ashamed, but said it did not diminish the good work they did.
In recent months, in incidents unconnected to the hospital video, there have been a series of arson and graffiti attacks involving homes, cars, and synagogues in Jewish areas across Australia, causing fear in the community.
A caravan packed with power gel explosives that police warned had the potential to cause a ""mass casualty event"" was found in NSW in January, alongside a document with antisemitic sentiments and a list of Jewish targets in Sydney.
The co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said the video served as a ""warning sign once again to all Australians about the evil that exists in our midst"".",Australia

BBC News, Sydney","A ""large"" sewer blockage caused by ""fat, grease and rags"" has forced the cancellation of a Bryan Adams concert in Australia on public health grounds.
The Grammy Award winning artist was due to perform at the RAC Arena in Perth on Sunday, but the city's water corporation said a blocked main risked backing up the venue's toilets.
Adams apologised to fans on social media - many of whom had lined up for hours only to be turned away - and thanked them for their ""patience and support"" before promising to try to reschedule the show.
The concert promoter said the cancellation was ""bitterly disappointing"" and would provide ticketholders with a full refund.
""While every effort was made for the show to proceed, this matter was outside of the control of Bryan Adams, Frontier Touring and RAC Arena,"" it wrote in a statement.
Perth's water corporation said the fatberg responsible for the disruption had already ""caused several wastewater overflows"" on the main road near the venue and urged the public to avoid direct contact with ""pooled water"" in the area.
""We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will provide further updates as required,"" it said in a post on Facebook, advising of the cancellation.
Adams - who is known for his tracks such as Summer of '69 and Please Forgive Me - made his Australian debut in 1984 and has remained a beloved performer across the country ever since.
""I'm really sorry we couldn't make this happen tonight — I was so looking forward to seeing you all,"" he posted on social media on Sunday.
The Canadian rock star is still due to play in Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne later this week.
Found in sewers around the world, fatbergs are formed when fat, oil and grease solidify and bind with items such as rags, or wet wipes.
They are known to cause serious blockages and environmental hazards. Last year, a fatberg weighing roughly the same as three double-decker buses was cleared from an east London sewer.

BBC News, Sydney","Australian reptile handlers say they have been stunned to rescue 102 venomous snakes from a backyard mulch pile in Sydney.
Cory Kerewaro said his business was initially called to rescue ""a bunch"" of the reptiles after one was reported to have bitten a dog at the property.
When his colleague arrived, he discovered 40 red-bellied black snakes - four of which gave birth to more live young once he had placed them in a removal bag.
Red-bellied black snakes are one of the most common venomous species in Australia but have not caused any human deaths on record.
The five adult and 97 baby snakes are currently under quarantine and will be released into a national park once the weather cools.
Mr Kerewaro said it was as record haul for the snake handlers, who normally catch between five and 15 reptiles per day.
He said he recalls colleague Dylan Cooper calling him within 15 minutes to say: ""Mate, I'm going to be here a while. It's a pretty big pile... I'm already over 15 snakes!""
""I thought he was stitching me up.""
The dog was ""alive and well"" after the incident which happened on Boxing Day, he added.
Female red-bellied black snakes often gather in small groups when they are ready to give birth, possibly to protect against predators, according to Mr Kerewaro.
They are the only snake of their genus to give live birth, the Australian Museum says on its website.
The species is considered to be shy, and bites - though uncommon - can cause swelling, nausea and diarrhoea.
Snake catchers are required by law to release the animals close to where they were found. But given the size this discovery, the catchers have been given permission to release the snakes into a national park away from human interactions.",Australia

BBC News","Hate symbols and terror offences will be punishable with mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years in Australia, after parliament passed a series of amendments to hate crime laws on Thursday.
The new laws were passed following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks which have become a major topic of debate in the country.
The amendments have been described by the government as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"".
But critics say that the governing Labor Party is caving to opposition demands and going against its own policy of opposing mandatory jail sentences.
Under the amendments, displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute is now punishable with at least one year in prison.
Other penalties include a minimum of three years for financing terrorism and six years for committing or planning terrorist acts.
There have been several attacks on Jewish targets in Australia in recent months.
Last week authorities in Sydney found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note.
The discovery came just a week after a childcare centre near a Jewish school and synagogue in Sydney was set on fire and antisemitic graffiti was seen on one of its walls.
In December, a synagogue in Melbourne was set alight with worshippers inside. No-one was seriously hurt in the incident, which sent shockwaves through the country.
Former Labor senator Kim Carr criticised the party for what he said was a ""clear breach of the Labor party national platform"".
Labor opposes mandatory sentences on the grounds that such penalties do not reduce crime, undermine the courts' independence and are often discriminatory in practice.
But opposition parties did not rush to welcome the new amendments either, accusing Labor of dragging its feet.
""The parliament is not acting today because of the decisiveness of the Labor Party,"" Liberal senator James Paterson told reporters in Canberra.
""The prime minister has been dragged kicking and screaming to finally introduce tough legislation that will ensure there are real penalties for this behaviour.""
Performing the Nazi salute and displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika, have been banned since January 2024 and carry up to one year in jail. The amendments on Thursday make the jail term mandatory.
""This is not about politics,"" Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday night as the amendments were introduced to parliament.
""This is about whether the Australian Parliament believes it's acceptable to advocate, threaten or commit violence against another person because of who they are, who they pray to or who they love.""",Australia

BBC News, Sydney","Australian scientists have produced the world's first kangaroo embryo through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a breakthrough they say could help save other species from extinction.
Using specimens from eastern grey kangaroos, the researchers successfully injected a single sperm cell into an egg, but said achieving a live birth would require more work and ""technical advancements"".
The feat provides important insights into marsupial breeding and could aid efforts to improve the genetic diversity of endangered species such as the koala, Tasmanian devil, northern hairy-nosed wombat and Leadbeater's possum, lead researcher Andres Gambini said.
Australia houses the largest variety of marsupial mammals, but it also has the highest rate of mammal extinctions.
The University of Queensland experiment looked at the growth of kangaroo eggs and sperm in a laboratory setting before creating embryos using a method known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
The technique, which is already used on humans and some domestic animals, was tried on eastern grey kangaroos that had died. The species was selected because it is not endangered and has existing high populations.
Despite how iconic marsupial species are in Australia and the crucial role they play in its biodiversity, studies into their tissues have been limited, scientists say.
""We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm,"" said Dr Gambini, adding that such methods would play a crucial role in safeguarding ""the genetic material of these unique and precious animals"".
IVF is being used as a tool to try and preserve endangered species the world over.
Last year, scientists achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother in Kenya.
In 2018, IVF was also used to create the world's first donkey embryo.",Australia

Cummins' absence would leave 50-over world champions Australia with a decision to make over the captaincy, with all-rounder and vice-captain Mitchell Marsh already out with a back issue.
McDonald said Steve Smith, who is currently leading in Cummins' absence in Sri Lanka and has captained Australia in 59 one-day internationals, and fellow batter Travis Head are the two options being considered.
Head has never been captain in ODIs but has been in charge for one T20 - a defeat by England in Cardiff last year.
""Pat Cummins hasn't been able to resume any type of bowling so he's heavily unlikely, so that would mean that we do need a captain,"" McDonald said.

Reporting fromTownsville","A second woman is confirmed to have died in flooding which has inflicted ""incredible"" devastation on communities in northern Australia.
Police said the 82-year-old woman's body was found in a cane paddock in Queensland on Tuesday, two days after a 63-year-old woman died when a dinghy she was in overturned during a rescue attempt.
The region has been inundated since Saturday, with parts of northern Queensland seeing nearly 2m (6.5 ft) of rain.
By Tuesday, conditions were starting to ease - although Queensland Premier David Crisafulli warned it was still ""a disaster that's going to test the resolve of people"" during an interview with broadcaster ABC.
He described the devastation as ""incredible"", but noted weather conditions had been ""really kind"" in recent hours. Thousands had begun to return to their homes.
In Townsville, locals woke on Tuesday to grey skies and drizzle, and the news that predicted flooding levels had not materialised there. It was a stark contrast to the intense downpours which have battered the region over the past few days.
""We believe that the danger has passed,"" Townsville Local Disaster Management Group chair Andrew Robinson told reporters.
Pointing to earlier forecasts which had suggested up to 2,000 Townsville homes could have faced flood risks, Crisafulli said that ""the city had dodged a bullet"".
Local resident Jo Berry told the BBC she and her family were among those returning home on Tuesday, after spending a sleepless night monitoring the rainfall.
""People talk about PTSD when it rains here and I totally understand,"" says Ms Berry, formerly from Leicester in the UK.
""We've been in the house here for over 20 years, and have been through a few cyclone events and the 2019 flooding so it is not our first rodeo,"" she adds, referring to a flooding disaster which caused A$1.24bn (£620m; $770m) in damage.
On Monday night, other local residents told the BBC they were ""on a knife edge"" as they waited to see whether their houses would survive.
But further north in the state, power outages and damaged roads have made it difficult to assess the full extent of the destruction in towns such as Ingham and Cardwell.
Crisafulli said early reports suggested the damage was ""quite frankly incredible"" and that Ingham, which is almost entirely without electricity, ""remains the biggest challenge"".
""There are people who have been inundated at home, in their businesses and in their farms,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.
Footage published in local media showed long lines at the town's supermarket as people waited for critical supplies. Crisafulli said that amid the blackout the local hospital was operating as normal, and a petrol station was open.
The flooding has caused damage to the area's homes, crops and coastline, local MP Nick Dametto said in a video posted online.
""The inundation is something that I have never seen before,"" he said.
Home to fewer than 5,000 people, Ingham was already reeling after the 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday.
The second woman's body was found on Tuesday just north of Ingham after a neighbour raised the alarm. She was last seen on Monday night in a house, Queensland Police said in a statement.
More than 8,000 properties remain without power across northern Queensland, according to the state's energy provider, and the partial collapse of a critical highway continues to hinder efforts to assist some of the hardest-hit areas.
Crisafulli said the recovery effort would ""take some time"" and that the priority in the coming hours would be to work with the army to get power generators to isolated communities and ""bring them back online"".
He added that federal funding would help reconstruct the battered Bruce Highway - the state's main thoroughfare which stretches 1,673km (1,039 miles) from the south.
Located in the tropics, northern Queensland is vulnerable to destructive cyclones, storms, and flooding.
Speaking to the BBC in Townsville, Scott Heron, a local resident and climate expert, said the latest disaster was not unexpected.
""For a long time, climate scientists have been clear that extreme weather events will become more extreme, and we are seeing that,"" said Prof Heron , who works at James Cook University and is the Unesco Chair on Climate Vulnerability of Heritage.
Prof Heron urged politicians to consider this as they planned recovery and rebuilding efforts, such as to the Bruce Highway.
It would be ""wasting public money"" if infrastructure planning, particularly for long-term projects including roads and bridges, did not ""incorporate changing threats due to climate change"", he said.

Mr Duric lives across the street from the Ross River – overflowing and fast-moving – in Idalia, one of six suburbs labelled ""black zones"" in Townsville, one of the areas hardest hit by a flooding emergency in Queensland state in Australia.
Authorities have urged people living in those spots to leave. They were given a deadline of noon on Sunday, but like plenty of others, Mr Duric has opted to stay put.

""We haven't panicked but we are prepared. Let's hope for the best and hope we don't have to use the sand bags.""
The city has been inundated with more than 600mm (23.6in) of rain in the past week. Other parts of the state of Queensland have seen almost 1.3m of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow, with officials suggesting as many as 2,000 homes could be inundated before the water reached its peak.
But by late Monday afternoon, both the cloud and the mood had lifted. The first break in the rain for days bringing smiles, and curiosity, as locals headed out to inspect the waterways.
For Daniel Watts, walking the dog with his family, there's a glimmer of optimism that their home will not suffer the same fate as during floods here six years ago – when water rose 1.5 metres and his property had to be gutted.
""It's been on a knife edge as to whether our house will get inundated or not, so there's been quite a bit of anxiety,"" he told the BBC.

Police confirmed that the girl had suffered life-threatening injuries and died shortly after 17:00. Australian media reports that she was 17 years old.
The waters around the beach are home to many sharks, but the attack occurred close to shore in the popular surfing spot, which has measures to protect against sharks.
Police confirmed the girl had been swimming in the waters off Bribie Island - just off the mainland, on which Woorim Beach sits - when she was attacked by the shark, the species of which has not been identified.
The Queensland Ambulance Service confirmed the victim suffered life-threatening injuries to her upper body.
She was bitten on the arm around 100m from shore, Australian media reports.
Christopher Potter arrived at the beach shortly after the attack happened. He told ABC News: ""There are a lot of swimming groups that swim along here, morning and afternoon.
""It's known there are a lot of sharks around Bribie, but this close to shore, it's still a shock.""
The waters near the beach are protected with drumlines - barrels anchored to the sea floor which have baited hooks to catch sharks that get too close.
Target species caught in these are then euthanised, while other species are relocated and released.
Police said they will prepare a report on Monday's incident for the coroner.
It is the second shark fatality in Australia's waters this year, after surfer Lance Appleby was killed off the coast of South Australia on 2 January.
The last fatal attack in the Greater Brisbane area came in 2006, when 21-year-old Sarah Whiley was killed while swimming with friends.

Northern Queensland","Australian authorities are scrambling to help isolated communities in Queensland after a flooding emergency forced thousands of evacuations, cut power to homes and washed away sections of a vital highway.
The flooding has claimed a woman's life and caused havoc across the state's north, with residents in Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell among the hardest hit.
""Record"" downpours are set to continue, authorities say, with parts of the region already experiencing almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese - who was briefed about the response efforts on Monday - said that the disaster had brought out ""the best of Australians"".
""I've seen Australians helping one another in their time of need,"" he wrote on X, adding that the ""threat from floodwaters"" would persist in affected areas for days.
Efforts to assist the hardest-hit areas have been hindered by flood damage to parts of the Bruce Highway - the main thoroughfare stretching 1,673km (1039 miles) from the state's south.
This included the partial collapse of a bridge that could add an extra 700km to driving routes and slow down the delivery of critical supplies, the Queensland Trucking Association told the ABC.
Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli offered his condolences to the ""tight-knit"" town of Ingham, after a 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday.
""We are deeply sorry for their loss,"" he told reporters on Monday.
Crisafulli also urged all residents located in the so-called ""black-zone"" of the floods - which includes six Townsville suburbs - to not return home, due to the ongoing threat posed by the nearby Ross River.
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the area had received six months of rainfall in three days.
About 2,000 homes could be inundated as water levels rise before their expected peak on Tuesday, the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group warned.
Many homes have already been flooded. One Ingham resident who lives with her elderly mother told the Townsville Bulletin that she had waited seven hours for emergency services to help them evacuate after their property was affected.
""I was crying, I was hysterical. Someone even hung up on me when I called [emergency number] triple-0, saying: 'We're busy,'"" she said.
Though rainfall is now easing, major flood warnings remain in place for communities along several rivers.
Crisafulli has warned that Ingham could be on track to experience its worst flooding in 60 years if the Herbert river surpasses a peak of 15.2m.
Emergency responders have continued working around the clock, with the SES receiving 480 calls for help on Sunday night and performing 11 ""swift water"" rescues. Widespread power outages continue to be reported, making it impossible for some communities to call for assistance.
SES Deputy Commissioner Shane Chelepy urged people to stay vigilant and check on their neighbours when possible. He added that some 400 people were now being housed in evacuation centres across Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell.
Authorities have also asked locals to be on the lookout for crocodiles, saying that they could be lurking in streams away from their usual habitats.

BBC News, Far North Queensland","A woman has died in Australia and thousands have been forced to flee their homes after torrential rainfall caused flooding in northern Queensland.
Authorities say waters will continue to rise and have warned of a ""dangerous and life-threatening"" situation, with parts of the region recording almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday.
""Record"" downpours are set to continue into Monday, according to Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli.
Meteorologists say these could be the worst floods in the region in more than 60 years.
Crisafulli said conditions were unlike anything northern Queensland had experienced ""for a long time"".
""It's not just the intensity, but it's also the longevity of it,"" he told Australian broadcaster ABC.
The woman who died was onboard a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy which hit a tree and capsized in the town of Ingham.
It is understood she was a member of the public who was being rescued at the time, and was not an emergency worker. The other five people on board were able to get to safety. An investigation has been launched.
Meanwhile, three people were rescued from the roof of a house in Cardwell, about halfway between Cairns and Townsville.
Video has emerged showing a man clinging to a pole in Ingham after his vehicle was washed away - and being taken to safety by locals in a boat.
The Townsville Local Disaster Management Group says that 2,000 homes in the city may be inundated - some up to the second floor - as river levels rise.
Thousands of people across six Townsville suburbs were told to leave their homes by midday on Sunday, but officials say about 10% of residents had opted to stay.
The same areas were severely hit during 2019 flooding.
Premier Crisafulli urged people to heed the warnings, saying: ""In the end, houses and cars and furniture, that can all be replaced. Your family can't"".
On Sunday night local time a new evacuation centre was being opened - as others reached capacity.
Parts of the road on a major highway collapsed, hampering efforts to get rescue teams and sandbags to the worst-hit areas.
Meanwhile supermarkets had run out of fresh food, and thousands of homes were without power, including in Ingham and the Indigenous community of Palm Island.
And there is a warning for locals to watch for crocodiles lurking in floodwaters away from their usual habitats.

BBC News","Authorities in Sydney are investigating whether explosives discovered in a caravan were intended for an antisemitic attack.
The explosives could have caused a 40m-wide blast and ""significant damage,"" police said on Wednesday, adding that the threat was contained.
A note was found in the caravan that displayed antisemitic messages, investigators said.
""This is the discovery of a potential mass casualty event,"" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said.
New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner David Hudson told a news conference that the caravan was discovered on 19 January in Dural, a suburb of north-west Sydney.
The investigation became public on Wednesday after details of it were leaked to the media.
There was ""some indication that the explosives might be used in some form of antisemitic attack,"" Mr Hudson said, but he wouldn't be drawn on the possible target.
He said officers had ""mitigated the risk as much as possible"" but stressed: ""I'm not saying it's been eliminated. I'm saying it's been mitigated.""
""That's one of the reasons we're talking today, for members of the public to be vigilant in relation to what they see and what they hear in relation to antisemitism in our community.""
An investigation involving the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has been launched.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told ABC Radio Sydney the threat was ""clearly designed to harm people"" and ""create fear in the community"".
He said he agreed with Premier Chris Minns in describing it as ""terrorism"".
It has not yet been designated as terrorism by NSW Police.
Earlier, Albanese said that New South Wales Police had ""people in custody"" and was working with the AFP taskforce investigating antisemitic crimes called Special Operation Avalite.
Minns said the threat would be ""met with the full resources of the government"".
The discovery follows a spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia in recent months.
On Thursday, police said a Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs had been vandalised with antisemitic graffiti.
In December, worshippers were forced to flee as Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue was set on fire.
Earlier this month, a childcare centre in Sydney was set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages.

Australia batter Steve Smith passed the 10,000-run mark in Test cricket as he scored a century on the first day of his side's opening match in Sri Lanka.
The 35-year-old went into the first Test of the two-match series on 9,999 runs and, as captain in the absence of Pat Cummins, chose to bat after winning the toss.
He came to the crease after Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne had been dismissed and nudged his first delivery to mid-on for a single to become the 15th batter to reach 10,000 Test runs.
""Fortunately hit that one in the gap so nice to get that one away,"" Smith told Australia's 7Cricket.
""Nice to tick that off,"" he added.
Smith went on to score 104 not out as he helped his side reach 330-2 at the close of play in Galle.
He is the fourth Australian to reach the 10,000 Test run landmark after Allan Border, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting.
Smith missed a year from the game when he was banned for 12 months after being part of the sandpaper ball-tampering scandal in a 2018 Test match against South Africa.
India's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test runs on 15,921, with Ponting second with 13,378.

BBC News, Sydney","Fourteen members of an Australian religious group have been convicted of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl who was denied insulin for almost a week.
Elizabeth Struhs died at home in 2022 from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes.
The court heard that Elizabeth's treatment was withheld because the group, known as the Saints, opposed medical care, believing God would heal her.
Her father Jason Struhs and the group's leader Brendan Stevens were on trial for murder but convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Twelve other members, including Elizabeth's mother and brother, were also convicted of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty.
When handing down his almost 500-page verdict on Wednesday, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death.
""It cannot be doubted that Elizabeth was lovingly cared for in almost every way,"" he said.
""However, due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive.""
The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and have roughly two dozen members from three families.
The judge-alone trial in the Supreme Court of Queensland began in July last year and lasted several months.
Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days.
""She was described as speaking little, needing help going to the toilet, and being incontinent,"" prosecutor Caroline Marco said, adding that the girl would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness.
The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for Elizabeth, whose health deteriorated as she lay on a mattress at her home in Toowoomba, about 125km (78 miles) west of Brisbane.
No effort was made to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, as the group believed she could be brought back to life, the court heard.
The 14 defendants, aged between 22 and 67, represented themselves at trial, having all refused legal representation or to enter pleas. The court was required to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf.
Most had been charged because they had either counselled or aided her father in his decision to withhold Elizabeth's insulin, the court heard.
Prosecutors said that Jason Struhs, 53, had converted to the church much later than his wife Kerrie Struhs, 49, and that he had previously supported giving Elizabeth medicine.
They argued he changed his mind after being baptised into the group and that ultimately he knew the decision would end his daughter's life.
Speaking through tears when it was his turn to take the stand at trial, Jason Struhs said that he and Elizabeth had agreed to ""stop the insulin"" together, and that he still believed his daughter would be resurrected.
""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" he told the court.
Stevens, 63, defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"".
He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"" and that their decision not to enter pleas was because the congregation had ""no intention of fighting"" the case by using law.
Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs told the trial she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them.
She and other witnesses described the congregation as having increasingly strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals.
The court also heard that Elizabeth's life had been in danger in 2019 when she was admitted to hospital in a diabetic coma weighing just 15kg (2st 5lb), after having become too weak to walk.
She was then diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections.
Both parents were charged over that incident - however Jason Struhs testified against his wife and received a more lenient sentence.
At the time, he said his wife - who had been a member of the Saints for years - did not believe in providing their kids with medical treatment for religious reasons. He also openly expressed regret for having ""let his daughter down"".
The court heard he later helped provide her with insulin for a period while his wife was in jail, but that he then faced pressure from other members of the religious group to stop doing so.
Giving his verdict, Justice Burns said that Jason Struhs and Stevens couldn't be convicted of murder because prosecutors had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the pair had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Elizabeth.
But all 14 defendants were guilty of manslaughter, he ruled, because they were jointly involved in a crime that resulted in her death.
Jayde Struhs said that while she was pleased with the verdict, the ""system had failed"" her sister.
""We are only here today because more wasn't done sooner to protect her or remove her from an incredibly unsafe situation in her own home,"" she said in a statement outside court.
The group is expected to be sentenced next month.
Toowoomba has long had a ""colourful array of sectarian Christian groups and independent churches of various kinds"", says Bernard Doherty, who studies new religious movements.
""The Saints appear to be one of these small independent churches which form around a few families,"" he told the BBC, adding that little is known about the close-knit congregation.
Jayde Struhs said the Saints had attended the Revival Centres International church in Brisbane, but they broke away after Stevens failed to become a pastor there. They then formed their own parish and held sermons at his house multiple times a week, she said.",Australia

BBC News, Sydney","Australian police are investigating after a statue of Captain James Cook was covered in red paint and disfigured, ahead of the Australia Day weekend.
It is the second time in 12 months that the statue in Sydney has been vandalised.
Australia Day is a national holiday that is held each year on 26 January - the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet landing at Sydney Cove in 1788. Many Indigenous Australians say the date causes them pain.
The local council in Randwick - the suburb where the statue is located - described the vandalism as ""a disservice to the community and a disservice to reconciliation"".
Councillor Carolyn Martin told Sydney radio station 2GB that the vandals had knocked off one hand and parts of the face and nose.
The statue - which was first unveiled in 1874 - was previously targeted in February last year, when it was covered with red paint and had parts of its sandstone damaged. Works to repair and restore it were completed a month later.
There are several Captain Cook statues across Australia, and others have also been vandalised on or around 26 January.
In 2024, one in Melbourne was cut down on the eve of the holiday, while its plinth was spray-painted with the words ""the colony will fall"". Two years earlier the same statue had been splashed with red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words ""no pride"" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it.
Cook charted Australia's east coast in 1770, laying the groundwork for the later decision to send the First Fleet, which was led by Captain Arthur Phillip.
Australia Day is a contentious holiday for some, particularly among those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who view it as a reminder of the dispossession and displacement of their people.
To many Australians though, it is celebrated as a day of nation-building and achievement. Polling suggests a majority of people are supportive of keeping the holiday, despite suggestions it should be changed to a different date.",Australia

BBC News","An endangered plant known as the ""corpse flower"" for its putrid stink is blooming in Australia - and captivating the internet in the process, with thousands already tuned in to a livestream to witness its grand debut.
The titan arum plant, housed in the Royal Botanic Gardens of Sydney, blooms only once every few years for just 24 hours.
Affectionately dubbed Putricia, it will release a smell described as ""wet socks, hot cat food, or rotting possum flesh"".
The long wait to see Putricia fully unfurl has spawned jokes and even a unique lingo in the livestream's chat, with thousands commenting ""WWTF"", or ""We Watch the Flower"".
The livestream attracted more than 8,000 simultaneous viewers on Thursday, doubling within hours as the plant's appearance slowly changed.
John Siemon, director of horticulture and living collections at the gardens, compared the spectacle to Sydney's 2000 Olympics, saying ""we've had 15,000 people come through the gates before it [the flower] even opened"".
""This specimen is around 10 years old. We acquired it from our colleagues in LA Botanic Garden at the age of three, and we've been nurturing it for the last seven years,"" he told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""[We're] incredibly excited to have our first bloom in 15 years.""
After days of inaction, the view on the livestream markedly changed on Thursday as Putricia, comfortably ensconced behind a red velvet rope, began to open up.
As she continues to bloom, viewers can expect to see Putricia unfold a vibrant maroon or crimson skirt, known as a spathe, around her spadix which is the large spike in the middle of the plant.
The gardens has said it is ""hard to predict exactly when"" Putricia will bloom, but that has not stopped the thousands gathered online.
""I'm back again to see how Putricia is going and I can see she's still taking her time like the queen she is, fair play,"" wrote one commenter. ""This is the slowest burlesque ever,"" said another.
Yet another person wrote: ""Overnight I watched, fell asleep, awoke, watched, fell asleep. I am weak, but Putricia is strong. WWTF.""
Other popular acronyms among viewers are WDNRP (We Do Not Rush Putricia) and BBTB (Blessed Be The Bloom).
The plant can only be found in the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia, where it is known as bunga bangkai - or ""corpse flower"" in Indonesian. Its scientific name is Amorphophallus titanum, which is derived from Ancient Greek and means ""giant misshapen penis"".
When in bloom, the plant's long yellow spadix emits a strong odour, often compared to the smell of decaying flesh, to trick pollinators into landing on what they think is rotten meat so they can move pollen between male and female specimens.
It has the world's largest flowering structure, as it can grow up to 3m (10 feet) tall and weigh up to 150kg. The plant contains several hundred flowers in the base of its spadix.
It is endangered in the wild due to deforestation and land degradation.
Putricia is one of several titan arums in Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens, which last saw one bloom 15 years ago.
But there have been other corpse flower blooms across Australia in recent years, including Melbourne and Adelaide's botanic gardens, each time attracting thousands of curious visitors keen on having a whiff.
There are also a few housed in Kew Gardens in London, where one bloomed in June last year. The titan arum first flowered outside of Sumatra in 1889 in Kew.",Australia

Mittens, an eight-year-old Maine Coon, was booked to travel from Christchurch to Melbourne on 12 January - but her cage was left in the Air New Zealand aircraft's cargo hold.
After waiting for three hours for Mittens at Melbourne airport, owner Margo Neas was told by ground staff the plane had already returned to New Zealand with her pet.
During that flight the heating was turned on to keep the cat comfortable, Ms Neas said. The pet - who had lost weight but was otherwise unharmed - was later flown again to Melbourne to reunite with her owner.
Speaking to NBC on Wednesday, Ms Neas said she and her son had been informed about the mishap by airport ground staff in Melbourne.
""They said: 'Look, we have located your cat - but it's actually on the return flight to Christchurch...'
""And I said: 'When did you discover that the cat wasn't taken off the plane?' And they said: 'We've only just discovered now.' And I said: 'How can this happen?'""
Ms Neas said she was told that the pilot had already been alerted to turn the heating on in the cargo hold where the temperature could be as low as 7C.
Air New Zealand is still looking into how Mittens was forgotten, but reports say a stowed wheelchair may have obscured a baggage handler's view of her cage.
The airline has apologised for the distress caused and promised to reimburse all travel costs.
The company does not accept direct animal bookings from the public for international flights, so passengers must book via approved pet carrier firms.
Ms Neas said she had been relieved to be finally reunited with Mittens.
""She basically just ran into my arms and just snuggled up in here and just did the biggest cuddles of all time,"" she was quoted as saying by the AP news agency on Wednesday. ""It was just such a relief.""

There has been a spate of such incidents in recent months, the latest of which saw a childcare centre in Sydney set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti. No-one was injured.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called a snap cabinet meeting in response, where officials agreed to set up a national database to track antisemitic incidents.
Thus far, the federal police taskforce, set up in December to investigate such incidents, received more than 166 reports of antisemitic crimes.
Albanese said it appeared some of the crimes were ""being perpetrated by people who don't have a particular issue, aren't motivated by an ideology, but are paid actors"".
""Now, it's unclear who or where the payments are coming from,"" he told reporters on Wednesday.
Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said it was possible that cryptocurrencies - which can take longer to identify - had been used.
He added that police were also investigating whether young people were carrying out these crimes and whether they had been radicalised online.
However, Mr Kershaw cautioned, ""intelligence is not the same as evidence"" and more charges were expected soon.
Last week, a man from Sydney became the first person to be charged by the federal taskforce, dubbed Special Operation Avalite, over alleged death threats he made towards a Jewish organisation.
Albanese said Tuesday's incident at a childcare centre in the eastern Sydney suburb of Maroubra was ""as cowardly as it is disgusting"" and described it as a ""hate crime"".
""This was an attack targeted at the Jewish community. And it is a crime that concerns us all because it is also an attack on the nation and society we have built together,"" he wrote on social media.
Israel's deputy foreign minister told the ABC that Australia's government had been ""inflaming"" problems in the local community by not clamping down harder on antisemitic crimes.
But Albanese on Wednesday said his government had ""acted from day one"" to protect Australia's Jewish community, and criticised those seeking to make it a ""political issue"".
The Jewish Council of Australia, which was set up last year in opposition to antisemitism, said that it ""strongly condemns"" this and all such incidents.
""These acts underscore the urgent need for cooperation, education and community dialogue to combat prejudice and promote understanding,"" it said in a statement.
Most of the recent incidents have taken place in Sydney and have involved antisemitic graffiti, arson and vandalism of buildings including synagogues.
New South Wales has set up its own state-level taskforce to address these incidents and more than 35 people have been charged so far with antisemitism-related offences. These include a 33-year-old man who was charged on Wednesday over an attempt to set fire to a synagogue earlier this month.

Sydney's Northern Beaches council said it has sent the debris to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) for further analysis.
Nine beaches, including popular spots Manly and Dee Why, were closed on 14 January after the marble-sized balls started washing up.
It came months after thousands of black blobs started appearing on the city's coasts in October, prompting authorities to close some of its most famous beaches for several days and order a massive clean-up.

The Queensland woman claimed she was chronicling her child's battle with a terminal illness on social media, but detectives allege she was drugging the one-year-old and then filming her in ""immense distress and pain"".
Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode.
After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud.
""[There are] no words for how repulsive offences of this nature are,"" Queensland Police Det Insp Paul Dalton told reporters on Thursday.
Between August and October, detectives say that the woman - from the Sunshine Coast region - gave the child several prescription and pharmacy medicines, without approval.
She went to great lengths to obtain the unauthorised medications and cover up her behaviour, they alleged, including using leftover medicine for a different person in their house.
Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing ""severe emotional and physical distress and harm"". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said.
However, Insp Dalton said the child was now ""safe and doing well"".

Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days in October and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of black deposits started appearing on the coast.

BBC News","A woman in Australia has annulled her marriage after realising that a fake wedding ceremony she took part in for a social media stunt was in fact real.
The unknowing bride said her partner was a social media influencer who convinced her to take part in the ceremony as a ""prank"" for his Instagram account.
She only discovered the marriage was genuine when he tried to use it to gain permanent residency in Australia.
A Melbourne judge granted the annulment after accepting the woman was tricked into getting married, in a judgement published on Thursday.
The bizarre case began in September 2023 when the woman met her partner on an online dating platform. They began seeing each other regularly in Melbourne, where they lived at the time.
In December that year, the man proposed to the woman and she accepted.
Two days later, the woman attended an event with the man in Sydney. She was told it would be a ""white party"" - where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing - and was told to pack a white dress.
But when they arrived she was ""shocked"" and ""furious"" to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographer's friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents.
""So when I got there, and I didn't see anybody in white, I asked him, 'What's happening?'. And he pulled me aside, and he told me that he's organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page,"" she said.
She said she had accepted his explanation as ""he was a social media person"" who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court.
Still, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend ""laughed it off"" and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not.
Reassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to ""play along"" to ""make it look real"".
Two months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners.
When she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the woman's testimony.
The woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip - before they even got engaged - which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the woman's.
""I'm furious with the fact that I didn't know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application,"" she said.
In his deposition, the man claimed they had ""both agreed to these circumstances"" and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an ""intimate ceremony"" in Sydney.
The judge ruled that the woman was ""mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed"" and ""did not provide real consent to her participation"" in the marriage.
""She believed she was acting. She called the event 'a prank'. It made perfect sense for her to adopt the persona of a bride in all things at the impugned ceremony so as to enhance the credibility of the video depicting a legally valid marriage,"" he stated in the judgement.

Former captain Steve Smith will lead Australia in the upcoming three-match Test series against Sri Lanka as Pat Cummins will be on paternity leave.
Smith, 35, previously served a two-year ban from captaincy following his involvement in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal.
Cummins is missing the series for the birth of his second child and seamer Josh Hazlewood is also left out as he recovers from a calf injury.
Spin-bowling all-rounder Cooper Connolly earns his first Test call-up while Nathan McSweeney, who opened in the first three Tests in the recent series against India, retains his place.
McSweeney, 25, scored 72 runs in six innings before being replaced by 19-year-old Sam Konstas, who is also named in the squad.
Connolly, 21, has played two one-day internationals and two T20s for Australia and is yet to take a wicket in either format.
He joins Nathan Lyon, Matt Kuhnemann and Todd Murphy in the spin attack, while Mitchell Starc, Scott Boland and Sean Abbott are the frontline seamers.
All-rounder Mitchell Marsh has also been omitted after a poor series against India while Beau Webster, who replaced him in the final Test at Sydney, keeps his spot.
The first Test takes place on 29 January in Galle.
Australia's series win over India saw them qualify for the World Test Championship final, where they will take on South Africa at Lord's on 11-15 June.
Australia Test squad for Sri Lanka: Steve Smith (capt), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cooper Connolly, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Matthew Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Nathan McSweeney, Todd Murphy, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw2w8qd7klo,How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war,2025-01-08T16:23:13.028Z,"Tiffanie Turnbull
BBC News, Sydney","For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches.
Swallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze, is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia.
""It's chockers [crowded]. They're all over the place,"" Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC.
For her – and most Australians – cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity trying to find a parking space. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach.
Polyester covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them.
""The sheer amount of space that people are taking up… [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating,"" Claire says.
She's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette.
A row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and even dragged in the prime minister.
Self-described haters say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers.
""When you're… polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle [Gay Uncle] Nic going to go,"" anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project.
""I just want my space on the beach, guys.""
But the pro-cabana mob say seeking protection from Australia's vicious sun isn't a crime - and it's every man for himself.
Australia is the skin cancer capital of the world, and many supporters – including national charity, the Cancer Council – argue the new trend should actually be celebrated.
""My partner and I have a cool cabana because we both burn extremely easily and we don't want to die of skin cancer by 30, hope this helps,"" one person wrote, responding to a TikTok rant.
No one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents.
Half the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun cream and a hat will do just fine.
Other cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing ""the prime piece of real estate"" on busy beaches.
She is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day.
""There's a lot of research that goes into this. You get up early, you've got to watch the tides. You can't just plonk it there and walk away… you invest in it,"" Smith argued on Nine's Today programme.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the hordes irked by the trend: ""That's not on,"" he told the same show.
""One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach. Here, everyone owns the beach… And that's a breach of that principle, really.""
Even lifeguards have opinions on the matter, with some telling local media the cabana camps can make it hard for them to do their jobs.
There are a number of cultural quirks which mean Cabanagate has Australians more worked up than a magpie in spring.
Firstly, the country loves to think of itself as an egalitarian society – the land of a ""fair go"" – and that extends to the use of one of its most precious national assets.
""Australian beaches, they always have been seen as shared spaces, democratic spaces where social hierarchies dissolve…. [they're] seen as a great equaliser,"" says Ece Kaya, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney.
And Australians are ""fiercely"" protective of that ideal: ""They see it as a birthright,"" says Chris Pepin-Neff, who studies Australian beach culture.
They point to the backlash in 1929 when beachgoers at Sydney's Coogee Beach were forced to pay for access to the only part of the water covered by shark nets. More recently, a bid to rent out part of Sydney's famous Bondi Beach to an exclusive beach club was met with a huge outcry.
And while the use of sprawling cabanas is a relatively new phenomenon, there's long been ""enormous class tension"" around the use of the country's coastline, Dr Pepin-Neff adds.
A lack of infrastructure, affordable housing and community attitudes tend to lock ordinary Australians out of waterfront areas, while those natural assets are often monopolised by those lucky enough to live there.
""And there's a perception that it's encroaching even further, [so] that an average family can't even get a spot at the beach.""
But they say there's no real data on who is using cabanas and why. They also argue there's many good reasons people might use them. Maybe they've travelled a long way so they plan to stay at the beach longer, or they may have a disability or young children they need to cater for, he says.
""There is a balance between a free and open beach that everybody can use, and making sure that you're respectful.""
They offer no defence for the ""land bankers"" though: ""As a Sydneysider, I think that is abusing the privilege… that is not a fair go.""
As the debate intensifies though, there are some calls for a truce to restore the peace to Australian shores.
Beachkit Australia founder Rowan Clark, who sells equipment including cabanas, told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper even he thinks cabana lovers should be more courteous.
""They should only allow set up at the rear of the beach in a line,"" he said. ""Once this is exhausted, then no more of this style of shade should be allowed.""
Others want authorities to rein it in, like some have in the United States. There are suggestions councils could limit how many cabanas can be set up on their beaches, and where.
But Sydney resident Claire, for all her wrath, worries that this could tip the scales in the other direction and exclude other people from using the beach.
""You don't want to get too precious about it, obviously… it's just the beach, first world problems right?
""I think in general, we should just try to be considerate of one another.""",Australia

BBC News","A hiker who went missing for nearly two weeks in New South Wales, Australia has been found alive, having survived on foraged berries and two muesli bars.
Medical student Hadi Nazari went missing on Boxing Day after he wandered off to take photos during a hike with his friends in Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains region.
Hundreds of people, including Mr Nazari's friends and family, joined search efforts to locate the 23-year-old.
He was found by other hikers around 15:15 local time (04:15 GMT) on Wednesday.
Mr Nazari had called out to the hikers and ""told them that he'd been lost in the bush and was thirsty"", Superintendent Andrew Spliet told reporters.
After the hikers contacted emergency services, Mr Nazari was winched over to the search command post by a helicopter. He was assessed by paramedics at the scene and conveyed to a hospital.
Mr Spliet said that Mr Nazari was found in good health - alert, able to speak and had no significant injuries.
The two muesli bars, which Mr Nazari had found in a hut in the mountains, was ""pretty much all that he's had to consume over the last two weeks"", said Mr Spliet, adding that the hiker had also found water from creeks and foraged for berries.
Mr Nazari's family, who were seen hugging him at the search base camp on Wednesday, later confirmed to local media that he was fine. ""It is the happiest day of our lives,"" they told 9News.
Mr Nazari was found near Blue Lake, around 10km (6 miles) away from the campground where he was supposed to meet his friends on 26 December.
""He's covered a lot of ground in that time,"" said Spliet, adding that police would ""catch up with him"" after he is checked out of hospital.",Australia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v14vxdjeo,To conserve or cull? Life in Australia's crocodile capital,2025-01-03T01:01:03.287Z,"Katy Watson
Australia correspondent
Reporting fromDarwin, Northern Territory","It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.
Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent – that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.
""You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,"" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.
We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.
The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.
And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.
Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.
After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.
But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.
They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.
The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.
""The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],"" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.
""And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.""
The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.
There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.
While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.
Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.
Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.
This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues.
Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.
His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.
The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.
The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.
""It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,"" says Ewin, who's been doing his ""dream job"" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.
""Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.""
Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.
The NT government goes into schools with its programme ""Be Crocwise"" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.
It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.
""We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?"" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.
""If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.""
In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.
Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.
This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.
Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.
In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.
Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.
It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.
Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.
The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT – for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.
Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch ""croc jumping"" - which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.
""I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,"" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat.
""The bit I don't have to tell you… [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here.""
For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them.
""It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,"" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.
Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.
It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.
Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; £398,000) - have all invested in the industry.
""The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,"" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.
His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.
Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.
One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.
For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.
""My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,"" the Balngarra man says.
""Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.""
But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.
The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.
Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.
Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.
But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.
""If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,"" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.
""The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,"" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs.
He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.
""We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator…and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them.
""You try and get people in Sydney or London or New York to put up with a serious predator - they aren't going to do it.""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c8xjw8v99kdo,The making of Konstas - Australia's new batting star,2024-12-31T08:27:08.431Z,,"'Unbelievable' Konstas ramps Bumrah three times in over
Sam Konstas first revealed his plan to ramp Jasprit Bumrah over a pre-match meal late on Christmas Day.
""We had dinner the night before the game and he said he would do it on 150 if he got there,"" his batting coach Tahmid Islam tells BBC Sport.
Fast forward a few hours and debutant Konstas, Australia's new 19-year-old batting sensation, was doing so on Boxing Day in front of 90,000 people at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Only, he had not waited until his 150th run, and not even his 150th ball.
""Initially I thought I might be out of a job as batting coach when he missed the first couple,"" Islam says.
Konstas may have failed with those first two scoops, but he tried again soon after and hit Bumrah - the world's top-ranked bowler - for a six and two fours on the way to 60 from 65 balls.
Those shots marked one of the most remarkable starts to a Test career in recent memory – cult hero status gained in a matter of minutes by a batter long tipped for the top.
Because, while Konstas' emergence at the highest level was explosive, the journey to get there has been long.
He was the Sydney suburb kid of Greek heritage who was scoring hundreds before his age had reached double figures.
In October he became the youngest player since the great Ricky Ponting to score centuries in each innings of a match in the Sheffield Shield, Australia's first-class competition.
Two years before that, and just a month after his 17th birthday, Konstas became the youngest batter to score a century for Sutherland in the top tier of Sydney's notoriously tough grade cricket.
The previous holder of that record? A certain Steve Smith.
""I remember not being too surprised it was him that did it,"" says Sutherland captain Tom Doyle.
The talent has always been there, those scoop shots too.
""We had a T20 game and he had come off a hundred in the U21s game in the morning,"" says Doyle, remembering another innings by Konstas while still aged 17.
""I remember him getting sledged by the opposition and he preceded to ramp like he did for Australia against some pretty intimidating first grade bowlers.""
A host of internationals have passed through the club's pavilion - Smith, Shane Watson, West Indies legend Andy Roberts and Glenn McGrath to name a few.
Konstas joined as a 17-year-old in 2022 from St George's - the club where the great Sir Don Bradman once played - in a switch that made the newspapers, such was the noise around him.
""It is hard to compare,"" Doyle says. ""From a talent level, Sam is no doubt on par.
""He is on this upwards curve where he keeps getting better and better each time he plays.""
Those that know Konstas describe him as polite and a hard worker.
During his time at Cranbrook School, then in his early teens, he first met Islam - a former first-class cricketer and a batting consultant in the school's cricket set-up.
He and Islam speak every day, practising together numerous times per week, while Watson, the all-rounder who played 307 times for Australia, has become a mentor working on Konstas' mental approach.
""The one that really sticks out was when I was at the rugby grand final and Sammy kept calling me,"" Islam says.
""He wasn't quite happy with how he had batted in his club session, had a game the next day and wanted a net session at 6am before his game.
""I remember thinking I have never seen anyone have that desire and hunger to make sure he has ticked every box to give himself the best chance.
""He hit for about an hour and a half and got 205 in that game.""

Konstas makes Big Bash history in Thunder win
How debutant Konstas 'lit up' Boxing Day Test
While Konstas' first innings in international cricket had all of the shots of a Bazballer, scoring big hundreds is how he made his name.
""Looking back on a lot of Sam's innings, he doesn't play every day of cricket the same,"" says Sutherland's Doyle.
""He is a multi-dimensional cricketer. The way he played in a lot of his first grade innings is more traditional, with a spark of flair here and there.""
The other thing people mention when talking about Konstas is confidence.
The confidence to ramp Bumrah, the confidence to not be put off by a shoulder barge by Virat Kohli, the confidence to point to the name on the back of his shirt when reaching 50 and wave his arm to ramp up the capacity Boxing Day crowd.
England might well be taking notes, with the Ashes coming up towards the end of 2025 down under.
""There can be a blurred line between arrogance and confidence,"" Doyle says.
""Sam has, through a lot of hard work and persistence, developed a level of confidence to score runs in a way that works for him.
""You see him revving up the crowds. We don't have crowds at grade cricket but that is his personality coming out. He is an energised, enthusiastic and eager cricketer.
""Him being that person for the crowd is just his personality coming out.""
That confidence will, of course, be tested as his international career continues.
The second-innings effort was more difficult for Konstas, as he reached only eight before Bumrah gained some revenge with an inswinger that hit middle stump having gone through the gate.
""He has always had this desire and hunger to get it right and to continue to develop his game,"" Islam says of Konstas.
""At the start of every season we write down a few goals and plans for the season coming up and playing Test cricket certainly wasn't part of that.""
Those goals may have changed after Konstas' week in the spotlight. He will hope the run-scoring does not.

BBC News, Gold Coast","On the table, unconscious and stretched out on a pillow, Joe Mangy looks deceptively peaceful. The koala's watery, red-rimmed eyes are the only sign of the disease at war with his body.
Tubes snarl out of a mask covering his face as a vet tech listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is not healing as well as they had hoped.
Eight days earlier, Joe Mangy – who is about two years old – was found wandering in the middle of a suburban road. Dazed and confused, eyes nearly glued shut with mucus, he was rushed here, to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary's hospital.
Enveloped by rainforest on Queensland's Gold Coast, the park is full of koalas like this.
Outside the clinic, in a ""Koala Rehab Centre"" faintly perfumed by eucalyptus leaves, is a three-year-old recovering from a hysterectomy. ""It saved her life… but she can't reproduce,"" the head vet Michael Pyne says.
Another male koala stares blankly through narrowed slits. His left tear duct is so inflamed his eyeball is barely visible.
This hospital is ground zero of a grim chlamydia epidemic which is killing thousands of koalas and making even more sterile, pushing the national icons to the brink of extinction.
But it's also at the core of desperate bid to save them with a vaccine – frustrated efforts which, after over a decade, are still tied up in regulation and running out of both time and money.
Even a few decades ago, spotting a koala snuggled in a backyard tree was nothing out of the ordinary. They were plentiful on the country's populous east coast.
But in recent times the species has been in dramatic decline – in some places plummeting by 80% in just 10 years.
Land clearing and urbanisation are leaving the marsupials hungry and homeless, while natural disasters are drowning or cooking them en masse.
""[But] it's the chlamydia that shot up tremendously - almost exponentially,"" says Dr Pyne, who has run the Currumbin clinic for more than 20 years.
""You get days where you're euthanising heaps of koalas that just come in completely ravaged.""
Estimates vary greatly – koalas are famously difficult to count – but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered on most of the eastern seaboard. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation.
Dr Pyne wistfully recounts ""the early days"" when his hospital only saw a handful of koalas a year.
They now see 400.
So many come through the door that the team has started giving them two names, a vet nurse says, cradling Joe Mangy as he wakes from the anaesthetic. His last name is a nod to the state of his eyes when he first arrived, she explains.
Of the top reasons koalas are brought into wildlife hospitals – vehicle strikes, pet attacks and chlamydia – the bacterial infection is the biggest and deadliest.
It results in conjunctivitis for koalas like Joe Mangy, but presents as an infection of the genitals and urinary system for others. Particularly unlucky animals, get both at the same time.
At its worst, the ocular form can be so bad koalas are blinded and starve to death, while the urogenital infection produces giant fluid-filled cysts so ""nasty"" everyday bodily functions like passing urine make the animals cry out in pain.
""Their reproductive system falls apart,"" Dr Pyne explains.
If caught early enough, treatment is an option, but that in itself is a potentially fatal ""nightmare"" as the antibiotics destroy the gut bacteria which allow koalas to digest otherwise toxic eucalyptus leaves – their main food source.
On a species level though, the disease, which spreads through bodily fluids, causes even greater ruin.
Chlamydia is not uncommon in other animals – koalas are suspected to have first caught it from livestock – but the spread and intensity of the disease amongst the marsupials is unmatched.
Experts estimate around half of koalas in Queensland and New South Wales could be infected, but just a suburb away from Currumbin, in Elanora, that has climbed beyond 80%.
It is the most diseased population in the region and numbers have been ""falling off a cliff"", Dr Pyne says. ""It's a disaster.""
Enter the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and their vaccine, which aims to prevent and treat chlamydia in koalas and has been almost two decades in the making.
Alongside Currumbin, they're trying to save the Elanora koalas from oblivion: capturing 30 youngsters and vaccinating them, before recatching them at intervals over three years to track their health.
So far only three of the vaccinated koalas in this research trial have contracted the disease, though all recovered, and encouragingly, more than two dozen joeys have been born - bucking the infertility trend.
""There's generations of koalas now that have come through. We've got grand joeys,"" Dr Pyne says excitedly.
Currumbin has also been vaccinating every koala which comes through their hospital, and have reached about 400 koalas this way.
But treating and vaccinating each koala with chlamydia costs them about A$7,000 (£3,500, $4,500). Capturing, jabbing, and tracking each wild Elanora koala is basically double that.
Two hours away, researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) are doing their best to flatten the wave of disease too, with a separate vaccine.
They inoculate about 2,000 koalas a year through wildlife hospital trials and tack themselves onto development projects or research studies in the region that involve their capture.
They've just wrapped a decade's-worth of those projects into one study of more than 600 animals – the largest and longest of its kind.
Incredibly, deaths dropped by two thirds among vaccinated koalas.
Molecular biologist Samuel Phillips tells the BBC about one local koala population they studied which was at risk of extinction. Authorities are now looking at translocating some animals so they don't overpopulate the area.
""It turned it around completely.""
And crucially, the study found that the koalas that did contract chlamydia were doing so later in life, after their peak breeding years had begun.
Dr Phillips and his research partner Peter Timms have now submitted their vaccine to the federal regulator for approval but say they're keeping their hopes in check.
""There'll be hurdles,"" Dr Timms explains.
In the meantime, for their small, overstretched team, dividing time and funding is an impossible balance. Do they involve themselves in as many trials as possible to help small groups of koalas now, or do they devote their efforts to advancing the tedious research and approval process which could help a huge cohort of them down the track?
""People come to us semi-regularly and say, 'Can we vaccinate more koalas?' And the answer at some point is 'No', because otherwise we're just spending all our time and energy doing [that],"" Dr Timms says.
It has now been a decade since these two research teams first started seeing results, and there is still no real timeline on when a jab will be ready.
And even when it is, there are huge barriers to any roll out.
While making the vaccine isn't that costly, finding, capturing, and vaccinating wild koalas is extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming.
Dr Phillips says they would have to strategically target select populations, though they're not yet sure how many koalas in each they'd need to treat to reverse decline.
That challenge will be doubly complicated with the QUT vaccine, though, because it requires two doses, as opposed to UniSC's single-shot formula.
The QUT team has been developing an implant – inspired by a human contraceptive device – that dissolves after four weeks to provide the booster. It will be trialled on Currumbin's captive koalas next year.
Then there is the question of funding, which has been, and continues to be, fickle. Both vaccine developers provide their shots to wildlife hospitals and research trials for free, relying on individual donors, generosity from their universities, and the unpredictable whims of election cycles.
State and federal governments are the biggest financial backers of the vaccine projects – last year Canberra gave QUT and UniSC A$750,000 each.
""No-one wants to imagine an Australia without koalas,"" Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said at the time.
But government contributions are random, and never quite enough.
""I cannot believe somebody will not come along tomorrow and say 'You need to vaccinate? Here's my cheque to cover the next 10 years'. But we can't find them,"" Dr Timms says.
However, the biggest barrier is the mountain of red tape researchers are yet to cut through.
Both groups have conservation charities and wildlife hospitals knocking down the door, desperate for access, but until they go through the ""painful"" approval process, their hands are largely tied.
""[It's] a critical step that is just taking too long. It kills me,"" Dr Pyne says.
""We've kind of passed it being urgent. It was urgent probably 10 years ago.""
Adding to their despondency, is a fact all involved stress repeatedly: the vaccine is simply not enough to save the species.
And so even the lucky koalas like Joe Mangy, who dodge death by chlamydia and return to the wild, still must face off against a myriad of other mortal threats.
""It's death by a thousand cuts, right?"" Dr Timms says.",Australia

Luke Walford, a youth pastor, had been spearfishing with his family when he was bitten on Saturday afternoon.
He sustained ""life-threatening injuries"" and despite paramedics' efforts, he died at the scene about an hour later, authorities said.
He and his family had been in the water at Humpy Island, in the Great Barrier Reef's Keppel Bay Islands National Park, when the attack happened. The area is a popular spot for diving and snorkelling.
Walford had been a school chaplain and pastor at the Cathedral of Praise church in Rockhampton, Queensland.
Donna Kirkland, his local MP, said she was in shock, and that Walford was a friend to her and ""countless others.""
""My prayers and heartfelt condolences are with his beautiful family and indeed the many who will be devastated, as I am, at this news"", she added.
A family friend told ABC News he had watched the rescue helicopter fly over his house, unaware it was for his friend.
""I always say a little tribute for whoever it may be, but to find out it was Luke was a very sad day,"" Doug Webber said.
Queensland police said a report would be prepared for the coroner.
Australia's last fatal shark attack happened in December 2023, when a teenage boy was killed in the south.
Just this year, there have been four other shark incidents in Australia, according to a local database.

The couple held a wedding ceremony in Sardinia in September, and were subsequently formally married at the service in Sydney, which was officiated by Wilson's sister.
The actress proposed to Agruma, a fashion and jewellery designer, at Disneyland in 2023.
Among well-wishers commenting on social media were Pitch Perfect co-stars Adam Devine and Elizabeth Banks, who offered their congratulations to the couple.
Wilson, 44, said it felt ""right"" to get married in her hometown: ""It meant my 94-year-old grandmother Gar could come, which was very special to us to have her included,"" she wrote on Instagram.
Agruma also shared photos from the day adding: ""Married officially in Australia to my Australian princess.""

Both crew members died in separate incidents after being hit by a boom - the large pole attached horizontally to the bottom of a sail.
The event's organisers said the incidents happened on the Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline.
The first boats are expected to arrive in the city of Hobart, in Tasmania, later on Friday or early on Saturday. Several have already retired due to bad weather.
New South Wales (NSW) police said the first incident was reported to officers just before midnight on Thursday local time (12:50 GMT) by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the country's capital, Canberra.
Just over two hours later, at 02:15 on Friday, NSW police were told that crew aboard the second boat were giving CPR to the second person, which also had not worked.
Flying Fish Arctos had been sailing approximately 30 nautical miles east/south-east of the NSW town of Ulladulla, the organisers said.
Bowline, meanwhile, was approximately 30 nautical miles east/north-east of the town of Batemans Bay, also in NSW.

Opener Sam Konstas is set to become Australia men's youngest Test batting debutant in 71 years in the Boxing Day Test against India.
The 19-year-old was called up to replace Nathan McSweeney last week after he managed only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40.
The series is currently tied at 1-1 with two matches left to play.
""He's composed, relaxed, knows his game is in a good place at the moment, he'll play Boxing Day,"" said Australia coach Andrew McDonald.
""We're really excited for him, Boxing Day, the biggest stage. He might as well get that one out of the way early.""
New South Wales' Konstas will be Australia's youngest batting debutant since Ian Craig in 1953.
Earlier this season Konstas scored two centuries against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, becoming the youngest player to do so since Ricky Ponting in 1993.
McDonald said he has been selected to take the game to India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with bowlers having had the upper hand in the series so far.
""We want to throw a different challenge at India at this point in time,"" said McDonald.
""We believe Nathan [McSweeney] is good enough for Test level. We weren't sure about how the top order was functioning. We challenged ourselves for that decision. Whether it works or not, time will tell (but) we're really confident that Sam can do the job.""
McDonald was also ""pretty confident"" Travis Head would be fit to play despite a quad strain preventing him from training on Monday.

BBC News, Sydney","Residents in an Australian region engulfed by bushfires were given two hours to return home to collect their belongings before Christmas on Tuesday, as emergency crews try to contain the blaze.
Communities around the Grampians, in Victoria, have been evacuated amid warnings from authorities that conditions there in the days ahead could be the worst since Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called ""Black Summer"" of 2019-20.
The bushfires have already burnt over 41,000 hectares (101,000 acres) of land in the past week, however there have been no deaths or loss of property.
Intense heat forecast for Boxing Day has also prompted a string of fire warnings across the country.
Throughout Victoria, temperatures are expected to reach 40C (104F) and be accompanied by strong dry winds, while parts of South Australia and New South Wales could also face bushfire conditions on Thursday into Friday.
""We're expecting to see extreme fire danger across almost the entire state,"" Luke Hegarty, a spokesman for Victoria's State Control Centre, said.
""This is the most significant fire danger that the state has seen – across the whole sections of state that we're talking about – since Black Summer. It's important that people understand that Thursday is a day with serious potential,"" he added.
Four interstate firefighting forces and two incident management teams - made up of over 100 personnel - will land in Victoria in the coming days to provide reprieve for emergency crews that have been working around the clock to fight the current fires.
The decision to give families around the Grampians temporary access to their homes ""to get Christmas items … presents and the like"" on Tuesday morning was made by the state's Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer, Jason Heffernan.
""[This is] to ensure if the residents of Halls Gap will be relocated for Christmas, at least they will have what they need,"" he told Seven's Sunrise programme.
Mary Ann Brown, who lives on the southern edge of the Grampians National Park, told the ABC that her community are on edge heading into the holidays.
""We are not out of the woods until we get a really good drop of rain and that may not come until March or April, so it's going to be a long summer.""
Parts of Australia have been on high alert for bushfire danger this summer, following several quieter seasons compared with the 2019-20 fires which were linked to hundreds of deaths and swept across 24 million hectares of land.

Culture reporter","The crocodile who starred in 1980s hit film Crocodile Dundee has died in Australia.
Burt, who was thought to be over 90 years old, appeared alongside Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski in the 1986 movie.
News of his death was confirmed by staff at Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin, a reptile and aquarium attraction where Burt had lived since 2008.
In a statement posted on Instagram, the wildlife centre wrote: ""It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Burt, the iconic saltwater crocodile and star of the Australian classic Crocodile Dundee.
""Burt passed away peacefully over the weekend, estimated to be over 90 years old, marking the end of an incredible era.""
In the film, character Mick Dundee (Hogan) swaps the Australian outback for the jungle of New York after meeting American reporter Sue Charlton (Kozlowski), who eventually falls in love with him.
The croc is famously seen in the scene where Kozlowski's character is attacked as she kneels next to a creek.
Burt, who was captured in the 1980s in the Northern Territory's Reynolds River, was described by Crocasourus Cove as having a ""bold"" personality.
""Burt was a confirmed bachelor - an attitude he made clear during his earlier years at a crocodile farm,"" the centre's statement continued.
""His fiery temperament earned him the respect of his caretakers and visitors alike, as he embodied the raw and untamed spirit of the saltwater crocodile.""
""Burt was truly one of a kind. He wasn't just a crocodile; he was a force of nature and a reminder of the power and majesty of these incredible creatures.
""While his personality could be challenging, it was also what made him so memorable and beloved by those who worked with him and the thousands who visited him over the years.
The statement concluded: ""Visitors from around the globe marvelled at his impressive size and commanding presence, especially at feeding time.""
It's not unusual for saltwater crocodiles to live beyond 70 years old, especially in captivity.
Burt will be honoured with a commemorative sign at the attraction.
Crocodile Dundee remains the highest grossing Australian film of all time, taking $47,707,598 (Australian dollars).
It also spawned two sequels, 1988's Crocodile Dundee II and 2001's Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.
Hogan and Kozlowski got married in 1990 but later divorced.

Australia have dropped Nathan McSweeney and called up 19-year-old opener Sam Konstas to replace him for the final two Tests against India.
New South Wales' Konstas is in line to become Australia men's youngest Test batting debutant since Ian Craig in 1953.
McSweeney was preferred to Konstas at the start of the series but he managed only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40.
Australia's chief selector George Bailey said Konstas' selection offers the chance to ""throw something different"" at India's bowling attack.
""I think Sam's method and style is different to Nathan's, should we go down that path,"" he said.
Earlier this season Konstas scored two centuries against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, becoming the youngest player to do so since Ricky Ponting in 1993.
Should the right-hander be picked, he would become Australia's youngest Test debutant since current skipper Pat Cummins, who was 18 years and 193 days when he played against South Africa in 2011.
Seamer Jhye Richardson, who last played a Test in the 2021-22 Ashes, has also been recalled with Josh Hazlewood out injured.
Fellow quick Sean Abbott and all-rounder Beau Webster, both uncapped at Test level, have been retained in the squad, having been called up previously in the series but not selected in the XI.
Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, who, like McSweeney, have struggled at the top of the order, have retained their places in the squad.
The Boxing Day Test in Melbourne starts at 23:30 GMT on 25 December with the series tied at 1-1.

Konstas averages 42.23 across 18 first-class innings
Konstas made his debut for New South Wales in 2023, less than two months after his 18th birthday, but has played only 11 first-class matches.
Part of the Australia team that won the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year, his breakthrough came with the twin centuries against South Australia in October when he followed a first-innings 152 - his first first-class hundred - with 105 in the second innings.
He has scored 471 runs at 58.87 in five matches in the Sheffield Shield this season and made a timely, 20-ball fifty for Sydney Thunder on his Big Bash debut on Tuesday, in doing so becoming the youngest man to score a fifty in the competition.
He also played for Prime Ministers XI against the India squad in a tour match between the first and second Tests and scored 107 from 97 balls against an attack featuring most of India's Test line-up.
He will still play in the Big Bash against Sydney Sixers on Saturday before joining up with the Test squad.

BBC News, Sydney","British YouTuber Yung Filly has pleaded guilty to reckless driving in Australia while on bail over rape allegations.
The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, admitted to driving at almost 60km/h (37mph) over the speed limit on a Perth highway last month.
He is yet to enter a plea on eight sexual assault charges, over allegations he attacked a woman in his Perth hotel room after performing at a nightclub in September.
Barrientos is best known for his work with the YouTube collective Beta Squad, and has presented shows on BBC Three.
Barrientos appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday, where his lawyer said her client would enter a plea of guilty to the driving offence, which resulted in his car being impounded.
The case was adjourned until 30 January, to be heard alongside Barrientos' other charges, which include four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm and one count of choking.
The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music when the alleged rape occurred. His bail conditions bar him from leaving the state of Western Australia or posting about the case on social media.

The 83-year-old faces 34 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault.
Mr Jones is one of Australia's most influential media figures and a former coach of its national rugby union team. He has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023.
After appearing in court, he spoke publicly for the first time since his arrest last month, saying: ""I have never indecently assaulted these people.""
""I want you to understand this: these allegations are all either baseless or they distort the truth, and you should know that prior to my arrest I was given no opportunity by police to answer any of these allegations.""
Mr Jones was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment on 18 November, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices.
Originally charged in relation to eight people - including a 17-year-old boy - police have since filed additional charges, and say investigations are continuing.
All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences.
Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio and TV host personally, and that at least one had been employed by him.
Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters last month.
""The law assumes that I am not guilty, and I am not guilty,"" Mr Jones told the media scrum waiting for him after his first court appearance in Sydney on Wednesday.
""That's all I can say at the moment, but I am emphatic that I'll be defending every charge before a jury in due course.""
A former teacher, Mr Jones coached the Wallabies between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career.
He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics.
A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues.
The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy.
He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had ""died of shame"", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should ""shove a sock"" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern.",Australia

BBC News","The five remaining members of the infamous ""Bali Nine"" drug ring say they are ""relieved and happy"" to be home in Australia, after serving nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons.
Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj arrived in Darwin on Sunday following years of lobbying by Australia on their behalf.
""They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society,"" said a statement issued on behalf of the men and their families.
The high-profile case began in 2005 when Indonesia caught nine young Australians trying to smuggle 8.3kg (18lb) of heroin out of Bali strapped to their bodies.
The eight men and one woman were arrested at an airport and hotel in Bali after a tip-off from Australian police.
The case made global headlines when two of the gang's ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed by firing squad in 2015 - sparking a diplomatic row between neighbours Indonesia and Australia.
Other members of the Bali Nine - most of whom were aged under 21 - were handed sentences of either 20 years or life in prison.
The case put a spotlight on Indonesia's strict drug laws, some of the most stringent in the world.
One of the nine, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of cancer in prison in 2018. Shortly afterwards, Renae Lawrence, then 41, the only woman among the group, had her sentence commuted after spending almost 13 years in prison and returned to Australia the same year.
Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society.
The five are banned for life from entering Indonesia, a spokesman for the government there said in a statement.
On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to several of the men's ""grateful"" parents.
""They did a serious crime and they have rightly paid a serious price for it. But it was time for them to come home,"" he told reporters.
He said the deal did not come with conditions or favours Australia would have to repay: ""This is an act of compassion by President Prabowo [Subianto] and we thank him for it.""
The men and their families also said they were ""immensely grateful"" to Prabowo.
They also thanked the lawyers, diplomats and government figures who had helped advocate for them over the past two decades, before asking for privacy.
""The welfare of the men is a priority, they will need time and support, and we hope and trust our media and community will make allowance for this.""
The five men are being put through medical checks at Darwin's Howard Springs facility - which was used for quarantine during the pandemic - and will begin a voluntary ""rehabilitation process"", Education Minister Jason Clare said. It is not clear what that entails, or how long the men will stay there.
He added that normal visa processes would apply to any Indonesian family members of the men, who did not follow them to Australia.
The Bishop of Townsville, Timothy Harris, who has supported the families of Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj since their arrests, said he immediately called Scott Rush's father Lee when he heard the news.
Scott's parents are eagerly awaiting the reunion, Bishop Harris told the BBC.
""They are mortified by what their son did. They always believed he has committed a crime... But this turn of events [has] filled them with a sense of anticipation.""
However, he said it would take time for the men to heal from their experience and re-integrate into society.
""If you think that through, your son commits a crime [and was] incarcerated in a foreign country, they return. How does someone get re-integrated into the family, let alone society?""
""Things have changed. The relationships need to be rekindled. They are going to have to face that as time goes on,"" he said.
""Once [Scott's family] gets to embrace him... I hope and pray things will be better, because there's nothing like having your family [nearby].""",Australia

BBC News, Sydney","A pilot who caused a deadly light plane crash on an island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been spared a jail sentence.
British tourist Jocelyn Spurway, 29, was killed and 21-year-old Irish woman Hannah O'Dowd seriously injured when the aircraft hit the sand on Middle Island in January 2017.
A jury found pilot Leslie Woodall guilty of dangerously operating a vehicle causing death and grievous bodily harm, after a short trial which focused on his actions after the plane's engine suddenly failed.
Woodall was given a two-year sentence, wholly suspended - which means he will remain free as long as he complies with certain conditions.
The three-day trial in the Brisbane District Court was shown footage filmed by one of the three passengers inside the plane, which captured the moment the engine stopped and Woodall sharply turned the plane to the left.
The Cessna 172N then rapidly lost altitude, before a wing hit the sand and it rolled.
Ms Spurway suffered fatal spinal injuries, and her friend Ms O'Dowd was left with a traumatic brain injury and a series of fractures. Woodall also sustained serious injuries, and a 13-year-old boy who was on board suffered a broken ankle.
Prosecutors argued it was not the engine failure that caused the crash, but rather Woodall's response to it.
Aviation experts who gave evidence during the trial agreed that Woodall, an experienced pilot, went against flight training and best practice. He should have kept the wings level in order to glide and safely land, they said.
However Woodall's defence team argued he had little other options available to him in a highly stressful situation.
In a 2019 police interview played to the court he told officers he was trying to reach a sandbank, according to reports by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
""I decided not to land in the water as it was deep, and I was concerned about the risks of drowning and the risk of bull sharks,"" the pilot said.
""I truly believe I did everything I could to ensure the safety of those on board.""",Australia

BBC News, Sydney","The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.
The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to ""community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders"" and will act as a deterrent.
But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.
The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.
The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the ""rights of victims"" ahead of ""the rights of criminals"".
""These laws are for every Queenslander who has ever felt unsafe and been a victim of youth crime across our state,"" Premier David Crisafulli said after parliament passed the bill on Thursday.
Leading up to the vote, both sides of politics had claimed that Queensland was in the grips of a youth crime wave, and that a more punitive approach was necessary to combat the issue.
But data from the Australian bureau of statistics, shows that youth crime has halved in Queensland across the past 14 years, that it hit its lowest rate in recorded history in 2022, and has remained relatively steady since.
Figures from the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology also demonstrate a clear downward trend.
Dubbed by the government as ""adult crime, adult time"", the new laws list 13 offences which will now be subject to harsher prison sentences when committed by youths, including mandatory life detention for murder, with a non-parole period of 20 years.
Previously, the maximum penalty for young offenders convicted of murder was 10 years in jail, with life imprisonment only considered if the crime was ""particularly heinous"".
The laws also remove ""detention as a last resort"" provisions - which favour non-custodial orders, such as fines or community service, for children rather than incarceration - and will make it possible for judges to consider a child's full criminal history when sentencing.
The Queensland Police Union has called the changes ""a leap forward in the right direction"", while Queensland's new Attorney-General Deb Frecklington says it will give courts the ability to ""better address patterns of offending"" and ""hold people accountable for their actions"".
But in a summary, Frecklington also noted the changes were in direct conflict with international standards, that Indigenous children would be disproportionately impacted and that more youngsters were likely to be held in police cells for extended periods because detention centres are full.
Queensland already has more children in detention than any other Australian state or territory.
Premier Crisafulli said on Thursday that although there may be ""pressure in the short-term"" his government had a long-term plan to ""deliver a raft of other detention facilities and different options"".
Australia's commissioner for children, Anne Hollonds, described the changes as an ""international embarrassment"".
She also accused Queensland's government of ""ignoring evidence"" which suggests ""the younger a child comes into contact with the justice system, the more likely it is that they will continue to commit more serious crimes"".
""The fact that [the bill's] provisions are targeting our most at-risk children makes this retreat from human rights even more shocking,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Other legal experts, who gave evidence to a parliamentary hearing on the bill last week, said the laws could have unintended consequences for victims, with children being less likely to plead guilty given the tougher sentences, resulting in more trials and longer court delays.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zgemkexdo,Australia turns to rugby to curb China influence in PNG,2024-12-12T07:56:13.683Z,"Tiffanie Turnbull
BBC News, Sydney","Papua New Guinea (PNG) will join Australia's national rugby league competition, after signing a deal that obligates them to shun security ties with China.
The Pacific nation has produced many stars of Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) and has long been lobbying to join the franchise.
Australia will provide A$600m (£301m, $384m) over ten years to set up the team – which will be based in Port Moresby and compete from 2028 – and help develop the game at a grassroots level across the Pacific region.
In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner.
The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called ""Pacific family"". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region.
If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team.
Announcing the agreement in Sydney on Thursday, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said it was a ""monumental"" opportunity for his country, and one aimed at fostering ""unity"" - not only between the 830 language groups in PNG, but also between the nation at large and its closest neighbour.
""For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people,"" he told reporters.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared it was a ""great day"" for both countries, and said PNG - the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport - ""deserves"" a spot in the league.
""The new team will belong to the people of Papua New Guinea… And I know it will have millions of proud fans barracking for it from day one,"" Albanese said.
It is a big milestone for the NRL too. This is the first time the competition, which is trying to lure international audiences, has expanded overseas. The only other foreign team, the New Zealand Warriors, has been a part of the competition since its inception almost three decades ago.
NRL boss Peter V'landys had been championing the PNG bid, arguing it was a huge opportunity for the league, as well as for PNG's economic development.
A name and uniform for the new team will be decided at a later point.
Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented.
The country has over the past decade been ""thinking innovatively about how you can marry sport with policy to counter classical security threats"" said Dr Murray, from Bond University.
In this case, he added, ""the scale, the size, the scope and the funding, and the fact that it's being endorsed at such a high level with both prime ministers - that's never been done before"".
""Basically, through this one channel, we will open up 20 or 30 other channels - for business, trade, policing, educational exchange, gender work, climate change... I think it is fantastic.""
Australia and China have each been vying for greater influence in the Pacific in recent years. After Beijing inked a major policing deal with the Solomon Islands in 2022, Australia has spent years trying to forge exclusive security pacts with countries across the region – including a policing agreement with Tuvalu last year, and a treaty with Nauru unveiled earlier this week.
Some have lauded the pact with PNG - which declared independence from Australia in 1975 - as another major strategic win for Australia.
""Over the past couple of years, with the heightened geopolitical interest and engagement in the Pacific, something a lot of other middle powers and major powers have struggled to do is to get PNG on a deal of exclusivity for security partnerships,"" said Oliver Nobetau, a PNG government lawyer turned policy analyst at the Lowy Institute think tank.
Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a ""thinning"" relationship between the two countries.
Marape made a point to say the agreement ""doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours"".
""We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,"" he said. ""But in security, closer to home… our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed… together.""
Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as ""an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty"".
Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging ""transactional"" dynamic in Pacific relations.
""People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,"" Dr Murray said. ""For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy.""
Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region.
""China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure… which is sort of what China is good at… [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,"" Mr Nobetau said.
""It's something that other countries can't do,"" Dr Murray added. ""We need to use it, especially in a very, very contested region such as the Pacific.""",Australia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pvgjklevo,Australia to force tech giants to keep paying for news,2024-12-12T06:13:53.742Z,"Hannah Ritchie
BBC News, Sydney","Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.
The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.
Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.
The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; £125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.
The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.
In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was ""charging one industry to subsidise another"".
Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.
""Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,"" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.
The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.
That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.
As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.
Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.
""We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content… news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,"" it said in a statement in February.
The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as ""a fundamental dereliction"" of Meta's ""responsibility to its Australian users"".
""The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,"" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.
The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.
The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue.",Australia

BBC News, Sydney","Australian police have launched an investigation after a car was set alight and houses were vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney.
The incident has been condemned by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a ""hate crime"". He told ABC News: ""There's no place for antisemitism in this country, or anywhere for that matter.""
It comes days after a fire engulfed a synagogue in Melbourne, causing minor injuries to one man, in what police there are treating as a probable terror attack.
Authorities in Sydney said they were seeking two people aged between 15 and 20 over the vandalism incident.
The pair had been wearing ""face coverings and dark clothing"" and were seen running from the scene, New South Wales Police said.
""We need public assistance to come forward and help identify those two people,"" Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters.
Police said the car blaze was extinguished shortly after firefighters were called to the scene in Woollahra, a suburb in Sydney's east, at around 01:00 local time (14:00 GMT).
Anti-Israel messages, including ""Kill Israiel"" [sic], were found at the scene, scrawled on the fence of two properties and cars.
The vehicle that was set on fire had been driven to the scene by the suspects, police said.
Albanese said he had spoken to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) about the vandalism.
Earlier this week, the law enforcement body established a special taskforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism, including the alleged terror attack in Melbourne, and another vandalism spree that occurred in Woollahra last month. Police do not believe the two incidents in Woollahra are linked.
New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the latest incident appeared to have been ""specifically designed"" to ""intimidate the Jewish community in Sydney"".
""If the question is can we do more? I think the answer is yes, and I'm not closing the door to changes to the law,"" he told reporters, adding that he had spoken with Israel's Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon.

BBC News, Sydney","Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has pleaded guilty over a car incident in Australia which killed his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins.
Hoskins died in hospital on 30 December 2023, after being struck by a vehicle being driven by Dennis outside their home in Adelaide.
The 34-year-old was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care, but on Tuesday he admitted a lesser charge - one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm.
Dennis - who has two children with Hoskins - will be sentenced at a later date.
Few details are known about the circumstances leading up to Hoskins's death.
However, Dennis's guilty plea means he has admitted to driving a car when Hoskins was in close proximity, knowing that act was likely to cause harm or being recklessly indifferent to whether it would.
""There was no intention of Mr Dennis to harm his wife and this charge does not charge him with responsibility for her death,"" the retired athlete's lawyer told the court.
Hoskins was a world champion in the team pursuit in 2015 and a two-time Olympian, and her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world.
She and Dennis married in 2018.
Dennis retired at the end of the 2023 season after a career in which he won stages at the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana.

BBC News, Sydney","A fire which ripped through Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue is being treated as a likely terror attack, Australian police say.
Three suspects are being hunted over Friday's early-morning blaze, which left one man with a minor burn to his hand and caused extensive damage.
Witnesses say they saw masked figures spreading what appeared to be an accelerant in the building, before setting it alight.
Victoria Police say they have no evidence that further antisemitic attacks are planned, but patrols are being increased to reassure the community.
After a meeting with Australian Federal Police and domestic spy agency Asio, the state police force said additional ""intelligence"" had led them to conclude the incident should be treated as a probable terror attack.
Commissioner Shane Patton said police had no information before the fire to suggest an arson attack was imminent.
He declined to provide any further details on the investigation while it continued.
Mr Patton's declaration came a day after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the incident as ""quite clearly terrorism"" while acknowledging police were still to make up their minds. He called his description a ""personal view"".
On Monday, state Premier Jacinta Allan said the terror designation meant police would now have extra resources for their investigation.
Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia, and that it has heightened fears of violence.
A few worshippers were inside the building at the time of the fire, and have described hearing banging and seeing a window smash, before liquids were thrown inside and lit on fire.
""The whole thing took off pretty quickly,"" synagogue board member Benjamin Klein, who spoke to witnesses, told The Age newspaper.
After officers at the scene were confronted by angry and scared worshippers on Friday, Mr Patton said police were focused on ensuring their safety.
""We have... extra police officers deployed in those areas where there are high numbers of Jewish persons living and congregating,"" he said.
Allan also called for the city to rally behind its Jewish communities.
""We cannot let this conflict overseas continue to be a cloak for behaviour like [this].""
Albanese also on Monday announced a new federal strikeforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism.

BBC News","Australian breaker Rachael Gunn's legal team has stopped a musical parody about her journey to the Paris Olympics from taking to the stage.
The show titled 'Raygun: The Musical' was created by Australian comedian Steph Broadbridge, who was also due to feature in the cast.
It was due to debut on Saturday at Kinselas in Darlinghurst, Sydney, but Broadbridge was forced to cancel the show after lawyers sent a cease and desist letter, saying that the Olympian owned the dance moves.
In a statement to the Guardian, Gunn's legal and management team said it was committed to protecting her intellectual property and ensuring that her brand remained strong and respected.
Some of Gunn's unconventional moves - such as the sprinkler and kangaroo-hop - went viral after her Olympics performance.
Now, Gunn's lawyers have reportedly trademarked the poster for the musical and advised Broadbridge that she was ""not allowed"" to do the kangaroo dance because Gunn ""owns"" it.
""That one did puzzle me - I mean, that's an Olympic-level dance,"" Broadbridge said in her Instagram video. ""How would I possibly be able to do that without any formal breakdancing training?""
Broadbridge said on Instagram that she planned for the show to be ""back soon"" and ""with a whole new story arc"". Everyone who was due to attend the trial show would be offered a refund for their A$10 ticket, she added.
She said: ""They [Gunn's legal team] were worried I was damaging her brand, which I would never.""
Gunn failed to receive a single point from judges at this summer's Olympic games and was subsequently eliminated from the round-robin stage which led to a torrent of abuse online.
Despite being defended by officials, her performance divided opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the scene.
Gunn had initially planned to keep competing after the Olympics, but in November said the saga had been so ""upsetting"" that she changed her mind and had decided to retire.
She ended her video saying that she intends to change the name of her character to ""Raygun with an I"" in hopes that ""fixes everyone's concerns"".
In their statement to The Guardian, Gunn's legal team said: ""While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael's creative rights and the integrity of her work.

Community leaders told local media that ""a few people"" were inside at the time for morning prayers, and they had reported seeing firebombs thrown. One person was injured and the fire caused extensive damage.
Police say they believe the fire was deliberately lit but are keeping an ""open mind"" on a motive.
In a statement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the incident in Ripponlea, in the city's south-east, was ""clearly aimed at creating fear in the community"".
""This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage,"" he wrote.
""I have zero tolerance for antisemitism.""
He added that he had been briefed by the Australian Federal Police, who would provide support to authorities in the state of Victoria.
""The people involved must be caught and face the full force of the law.""
Victoria Police said the exact cause of the fire had not yet been determined and an arson chemist would visit the site.
However Det Insp Chris Murray said a witness had told them two people in masks appeared to have spread accelerant inside the building.
""We believe it was deliberate. We believe it has been targeted,"" he added. ""What we don't know is why.""
He appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage from the local area, to contact police.
Synagogue board member Benjamin Klein told The Age newspaper that people inside ""heard banging on the door and the window, and some liquids came through which were lit"".

BBC News, Sydney","A man wanted over one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, dubbed the Easey Street murders, has arrived in Melbourne after being extradited from Italy.
Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were stabbed to death in their Melbourne house in 1977, in a case which has gripped the nation ever since.
Police said suspect Perry Kouroumblis, 65, only became the focus of their investigation in recent years after DNA testing breakthroughs.
Mr Kouroumblis - who has not been charged and maintains his innocence - was detained in Italy in September. If charged, he is expected to face court later this week, according to local media.
Mr Kouroumblis first came to police attention the week after the murders, when the then 17-year-old said he had found a bloodied knife near the scene in Easey Street, Collingwood, an inner-city suburb.
The bodies of the high school friends were discovered three days after they were last seen alive. Ms Armstrong's one-year-old son was also found in the home, unharmed in his cot.
Both women had been stabbed more than a dozen times and Ms Armstrong had been sexually assaulted, police say.
The case has long drawn huge interest - becoming the subject of major police appeals, true crime books and a hit podcast. In 2017 Victoria Police offered a A$1m (£511,800, $647,600) reward for information.
Commissioner Shane Patton described the murders as ""an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide"" when announcing the arrest of Mr Kouroumblis - a dual Greek-Australian citizen - in Rome in September.
""This was a crime that struck at the heart of our community - two women in their own home, where they should have felt their safest,"" he said.
Police had issued an Interpol red notice for Mr Kouroumblis on two charges of murder and one of rape, after he left Australia about seven years ago.
But he was not able to be arrested in Greece, where he had been living, as the country's law requires murder charges to be laid within 20 years of an alleged crime.
At the time of Mr Kouroumblis's arrest, the women's families released a statement, saying their lives had been changed ""irrevocably"" by the murders.

Eleven men and two juveniles were arrested, including the vessel's crew and others waiting on the shore to collect the illegal shipment.
The drugs had an estimated street value of A$760m ($490m; £388m), with the potential to be distributed across 11.7 million separate street deals - making it the largest cocaine bust in Australian history.
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) alleged one of the men arrested on Saturday night was vice-president of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle club’s Brisbane chapter.
Biker gangs are notorious in Australia for their drug violence, with more than 1,000 shootings recorded since the 1980s.
This recent cocaine bust came as part of a wider investigation into the Comanchero gang, codenamed Operation Tyrrendor, which began last month.
Authorities said they received intelligence suggesting a criminal syndicate with links to the gang was planning to import illegal drugs into Australia.
This comes after reports last week that the Colombian navy intercepted a semi-submersible carrying cocaine to Australia.
Investigators told reporters in Brisbane the record cocaine shipment had come from an unidentified South American country.
The AFP worked with the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and the Australian Border Force (ABF) to track a fishing boat, recently purchased by a 35-year-old man.
On Saturday night, it was being used to transport the cocaine delivery from a larger mothership to the Queensland coast when it suffered a mechanical fault, police said.
Stranded about 18km from the north-eastern tip of K'gari, it was intercepted by the AFP and QPS, who found 51 bales of cocaine tied with rope netting.
Two men were arrested on the boat and two others were arrested on the coast while waiting for the shipment.
A further three arrests were made at a nearby fast-food restaurant, with five others at a traffic stop.

In addition to this case, the BBC understands Griffith is separately accused of abusing at least two dozen children in the Australian state of New South Wales and in Italy.
In the Brisbane District Court on Friday, Judge Smith said Griffith - who the court heard had a ""paedophilic disorder"" - had a high risk of reoffending, ordering a non-parole period of at least 27 years.
Griffith was first arrested in August 2022 by the Australian Federal Police, and a year later charged with more than 1,600 child sex offences. Most of these were eventually dropped.

Investigators found thousands of photographs and videos of his abuse, which he had filmed and uploaded onto the dark web.
Although faces were cropped out of the footage, they managed to trace them to Griffith because of a unique set of bedsheets seen in the background of some of the videos, which had been sold to childcare centres across Queensland.
He pleaded guilty to 28 counts of rape, almost 200 charges relating to indecent treatment of a child, and several related to making and sharing child exploitation material.
Four of the girls who featured in his videos were from a childcare centre in Pisa, Italy. His other 65 victims were from 11 locations across Brisbane.
Ahead of his sentence behind handed down, the court heard a string of emotional statements from some of those victims and their parents - who cannot be identified for legal reasons.
Among them were two sisters who were abused in kindergarten, one of whom recalled Griffith being her favourite teacher.
""To find out what he was really doing was devastating... I don’t seem to be able to process it even now, because there’s a disconnect between what I remember and the reality,"" she said, according to The Courier Mail.
Another woman told how his actions had robbed her of a normal childhood, recounting her struggles with mental illness in the years since.
""I will never know what my life could have been like,"" she is quoted as saying, in an article by The Guardian Australia.
""I can never know what it would have been to grow up unafraid of people.""
Parents meanwhile told the court of their horror upon discovering the crimes inflicted upon their children, with several saying they struggled to forgive themselves for trusting Griffith.
""(My daughter) loved you like an uncle and you used her like a toy,"" one said, according to News Corp Australia.
Another explained how she was trying to keep the burden of knowledge of the abuse from her daughter.
""I cannot undo what you did to her body but will do everything I can to limit the damage to her mind,"" she said, according to the Courier Mail.
Outside court, the families called for an investigation into the childcare centres - and broader system - in which Griffith was able to go undetected for so long.

BBC News, Sydney","Australia will ban children under 16 from using social media, after its parliament approved the world's strictest laws.
The ban, which will not take effect for at least 12 months, could see tech companies fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they don't comply.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the legislation is needed to protect young people from the ""harms"" of social media, something many parent groups have echoed.
But critics say questions over how the ban will work - and its impact on privacy and social connection - have been left unanswered.
This is not the first attempt globally to restrict children's social media use, but the minimum age of 16 is the highest set by any country. Unlike other attempts, it also does not include exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.
Having passed the Senate by 34 votes to 19 late on Thursday, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where it passed early on Friday.
“We want our kids to have a childhood and parents to know we have their backs,"" Albanese told reporters afterwards.
The legislation does not specify which platforms will be banned. Those decisions will be made later by Australia’s communications minister, who will seek advice from the eSafety Commissioner - an internet regulator that will enforce the rules.
However the minister, Michelle Rowland, has said the ban will include Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and X. Gaming and messaging platforms are exempt, as are sites that can be accessed without an account, meaning YouTube, for instance, is likely to be spared.
The government says will it rely on some form of age-verification technology to implement the restrictions, and options will be tested in the coming months. The onus will be on the social media platforms to add these processes themselves.
However digital researchers have warned there are no guarantees the unspecified technology - which could rely on biometrics or identity information - will work. Critics have also sought assurances that privacy will be protected.
They have also warned that restrictions could easily be circumvented through tools like a VPN - which can disguise a user’s location and make them appear to be logging on from another country.
Children who find ways to flout the rules will not face penalties, however.
Polling on the reforms, though limited, suggests it is supported by a majority of Australian parents and caregivers.
""For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out,"" Amy Friedlander, who was among those lobbying for the ban, recently told the BBC.
""We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.""
But many experts say the ban is ""too blunt an instrument"" to effectively address the risks associated with social media use, and have warned it could end up pushing children into less regulated corners of the internet.
During a short consultation period before the bill passed, Google and Snap criticised the legislation for not providing more detail, and Meta said the bill would be ""ineffective"" and not meet its stated aim of making kids safer.
In its submission, TikTok said the government’s definition of a social media platform was so ""broad and unclear"" that ""almost every online service could fall within [it]"".
X questioned the ""lawfulness"" of the bill - saying it may not be compatible with international regulations and human rights treaties which Australia has signed.
Some youth advocates also accused the government of not fully understanding the role social media plays in their lives, and locking them out of the debate.
""We understand we are vulnerable to the risks and negative impacts of social media… but we need to be involved in developing solutions,"" wrote the eSafety Youth Council, which advises the regulator.
Albanese has acknowledged the debate is complex but steadfastly defended the bill.
""We don't argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for [children] under 18 doesn’t mean that someone under 18 never has access – but we know that it’s the right thing to do,"" he said on Friday.
Last year, France introduced legislation to block social media access for children under 15 without parental consent, though research indicates almost half of users were able to avoid the ban using a VPN.
A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - was overturned by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional.
Australia’s laws are being watched with great interest by global leaders.
Norway has recently pledged to follow in the country’s footsteps, and last week the UK’s technology secretary said a similar ban was “on the table” - though he later added “not... at the moment”.

Australia have added uncapped Tasmania all-rounder Beau Webster to their squad for the second Test against India in Adelaide.
The 30-year-old, who was player of the year in the Sheffield Shield last season, will join the national team for the match which starts on 6 December.
Webster averages 38 with the bat in first-class cricket and 37 with the ball.
He will provide cover for Mitchell Marsh, who is struggling for fitness following Australia's defeat in the first Test in Perth.
The Tasmanian, who bowls mostly seam but can also deliver off-spin, joins an otherwise unchanged squad as the home side look to square the five-match series.
He scored 61 and 49 batting for Tasmania against New South Wales this week, taking five wickets with the ball.
Earlier this month he scored 145 runs in two matches against India A, along with taking seven wickets at an average of 19.57.

by CricViz analyst Ben Jones
While few Australians have been banging the door down domestically, Webster has impressed. In the last four editions of the Sheffield Shield he’s the fourth leading run scorer, and is the only batter to average in excess of 50 having played at least 10 matches.
While spinners do tend to find life difficult in Australia, Webster’s recent record against them - an average of 172 in the last four years - is exceptional. He’s a tall man and loves to pull (average 94) and cut (average 200) the quicks.
Webster could also relieve the pressure that’s been placed on Australia’s fifth bowler Mitchell Marsh, who continues to struggle with his fitness. He often comes on first change for Tasmania, and in the 2023-24 Sheffield Shield season took 30 wickets at an average of 29, with an unusual mix of seam up and spin deliveries.
County fans may also be familiar with Webster from a brief stint with Gloucestershire last season, where he averaged 58 with the bat from four County Championship matches, and took a tidy 16 wickets at 21.

BBC News, Sydney","A police officer who Tasered a 95-year-old woman with dementia symptoms at an Australian care home has been found guilty of her manslaughter.
Kristian White, 34, used his weapon on Clare Nowland after the great-grandmother was found wandering with a small kitchen knife in the early hours of 17 May 2023.
Her death a week later caused public outcry, but White - a senior constable - argued at trial that his use of force was reasonable and proportionate to the threat.
Prosecutors, however, said Mrs Nowland - who relied on a walker to get around and weighed under 48kg (105lb) - was not a danger and that the ""impatient"" officer had neglected his duty of care to her.
Police and paramedics were called to Yallambee Lodge - in the town of Cooma about 114km (71 miles) south of Canberra – around 04:00 on the day of the incident, after Mrs Nowland had been seen roaming the care home with two serrated steak knives.
The trial in the New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court heard that Mrs Nowland, while not formally diagnosed with dementia, had been displaying signs of cognitive decline in the months leading up to her death and had at times behaved aggressively towards healthcare workers.
At one point that night she had entered the room of another resident holding the knives, though he told the court he did not feel unsafe, and she had also later thrown one of the blades at a staff member.
When emergency services found Mrs Nowland, they repeatedly asked her to drop the knife in her right hand, and – using thick gloves – had tried to disarm her themselves, the court was told.
In the moments before she was hit by the Taser, footage played to the jury showed the elderly woman using her walker to slowly shuffle forward - 1m (3.3ft) over the course of a minute - before stopping and raising the blade.
White warned Mrs Nowland his weapon was aimed at her, before saying ""bugger it"" and firing it, while she was still 1.5m-2m away. She fell and hit her head, triggering a fatal brain bleed.
“Who could she have injured at that moment? No one,” Crown prosecutor Brett Hatfield said, summing up his case for the jury last week.
He said White had used his weapon only three minutes after finding the woman: “He was fed up, impatient, not prepared to wait any longer.”
However in a written incident report, the officer - who had been stood down from duties while facing court - said he deployed his Taser because he felt a “violent confrontation was imminent”.
In court he added that he didn’t think Mrs Nowland would be “significantly injured” and that he was “devastated” by her death.
The defence pointed to evidence from one of the paramedics and White’s police partner, who both said Mrs Nowland had made them feel scared for their safety.
""I thought that I was going to be stabbed,” Jessica Pank, also a senior constable, said.
However, both agreed they could have easily moved to safety, given Mrs Nowland’s limited mobility.
Mrs Nowland's family, who were in court to hear the jury's verdict, thanked prosecutors, the judge and the jury.
""The family will take some time to come to terms with the jury’s confirmation that Clare’s death at the hands of a serving NSW police officer was a criminal and unjustified act,"" they said in a statement issued by a lawyer, which also asked for privacy.
NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Wednesday said White's employment was still under legal review.
She added that the force's Taser policies and training had also been reviewed but found to be appropriate.
""The death of Clare Nowland is a terrible tragedy... this should never have happened,"" she said.
White, who remains on bail, will be sentenced at a later date.",Australia
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c9wr4j18kego,How individual toll of Hughes' death still haunts Australia,2024-11-25T16:32:07.663Z,,"Phillip Hughes played 52 times for Australia
Warning: Some people may find this article upsetting. For help and support dealing with grief, please visit the BBC Action Line
At some point in the previous year, for a lot of people who follow cricket, the thought would have come up.
Late November in the last nine years has included moments of remembrance for Phillip Hughes, Australia's prodigy who died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield in 2014, trying to make a score to get back into the Test team. This year marks a decade since that loss.
In grief, milestones are everywhere. The ones that surprise us are marked in space, things we stumble into like low furniture. Here's a garden near my old house, and here's me remembering the last time you walked through it.
The predictable ones are marked in time. Months at first, then anniversaries, birthdays twinned in the mental calendar with dates of death. Some dates evaporate. Some lodge.
So in a world that puts store in anniversaries, this one is significant. And complicated. Hughes' injury happened on 25 November, two days before an official announcement of death.
That means there is not exactly an anniversary, but more a long weekend of mourning. For those three days in the cricket world you are acutely aware of the sensitivity.
This coming week or two his story will feature heavily. The Perth Test, which finished on Monday, was never planned to be part of this, given the lack of certainty around an end date. The ceremony instead will happen around the Adelaide Test from 6 December.
Hughes' final match was for South Australia, and the tribute Test that followed his death was also against India at Adelaide.
Three of those players from a decade ago were still in the team in Perth this week: Nathan Lyon, Steve Smith and Mitchell Marsh. The 2014 Shield match involved three current players - Lyon, Mitchell Starc and Travis Head - as well as commentators Callum Ferguson, David Warner and Brad Haddin.
Even now, we probably underestimate the effect on that generation of cricketers. The players at that match had the trauma of being there.
Others who were not there still suffered. Peter Siddle played for Victoria but was Hughes' national team-mate. After a Test hat-trick on his birthday in 2010, Siddle had a fun three years of people posting memes about it each year.
But his birthday is 25 November. From 2014 the association changed completely, and he later explained in a podcast interview how he became weighed down with sadness whenever someone mentioned his birthday.
Glenn Maxwell became a meme, too, when he charged a pace bowler in a Big Bash game before failing to play a shot and being bowled. He was mocked worldwide.
Melbourne journalist Ron Reed wrote that it ""looked like the work of a man in a mental meltdown"" and that ""his form has deteriorated alarmingly over the past few weeks"" - but even then nobody joined the dots.
It was one month after Hughes had died. Maxwell was an emotional wreck, the two of them close from age-group cricket. Only this year Maxwell explained the context in his book. Until then nobody had asked.
Michael Clarke delivering the eulogy for Phillip Hughes
Or take Michael Clarke, national captain at the time, close with Hughes from New South Wales cricket, who gave the very public eulogy days before leading his team in the tribute Test. Clarke later said that he should have retired after that match, rather than battling to lead the 2015 World Cup and Ashes campaigns when he was mentally shot.
Even for people who did not know Hughes, the 10-year commemoration will be emotional. For so many this is the defining memory of 2014: the intense and spontaneous upswell of sorrow, how astonishing it was to see and share it across Australia and worldwide.
The symbolism made sense. Hughes represented youth and vitality, as a 25-year-old sportsman. Potential, as a player of 26 Tests who was tipped to play a hundred more. Injustice, first at the trivial level of his problems with selectors, then the tragic luck of his injury. Talent, that would never get its full display. A prodigy cut short, a smiling kid who was apparently everyone's mate. Losing those things moved people deeply.
This year, people will revisit those feelings. The sudden sadness, the surprise. They will see how much time has passed and think about how different they were, their life was, our world was. They will feel that world moving on.
Time is supposed to ease grief, but it sharpens it too: time passing means that your time with the person you loved grows further away. That holds its own grief. They recede, you keep moving on a path they can no longer join.
This is the part of memory, the one means of keeping somebody with you when your ways have parted. Now and then as you move through your world, it offers ways to remind you, and you listen.

BBC News","A tourist in Tasmania has had his leg amputated in the middle of a raging river after getting trapped between rocks during a kayaking trip with friends.
Medics said they made the ""life or death"" decision in consultation with the international visitor during a complex rescue on the Franklin River lasting some 20 hours.
The visitor in his 60s was partially submerged in water throughout the ordeal, and rescuers said it was clear that ""had he remained in the location where he was, and trapped in the rock crevice he would not have survived"".
Multiple attempts to move him prior to the amputation were unsuccessful, police in the Australian island state said.
The tourist was kayaking with a group in the south-west of Tasmania when his leg got stuck between rocks in an area of rapids on Friday afternoon.
Emergency services rushed to the remote and inaccessible area after the man's smartwatch called for assistance, police said.
After a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to free the man overnight and as his condition deteriorated, the decision was made to amputate his leg so he could be winched from the location and airlifted to hospital.
""This rescue was an extremely challenging and technical operation, and an incredible effort over many hours to save the man’s life,” Doug Oosterloo, acting assistant commissioner at Tasmania Police, said in a statement.
""This was a life and death situation,"" Oosterloo told Australian national broadcaster ABC.
The man is now in a critical condition in hospital.
Oosterloo said that though the kayaker was “well prepared”, he wasn’t prepared for spending ""that significant amount of time in a rock crevice with that temperature and the torrent of water that was he was under”.
The other 10 travellers who were kayaking with the man were being airlifted from the area and police plan to speak to them about how the accident happened, the Australian Associated Press reported.
Oosterloo told the news agency that the tourists had stopped kayaking and were on the shore when the man slipped.

BBC News","Singer Katy Perry has successfully appealed against a trademark decision over her name, after being sued by an Australian designer who sells clothes under her birth name Katie Perry.
Three appeals judges on Friday overturned a court decision last year that favoured Katie Taylor over merchandise sold by the pop star during a 2014 tour of Australia.
The judges said Perry had been using her name as a trademark five years before Taylor started her business, adding that by that time, Perry had attained an ""international reputation"" in entertainment.
The judges also cancelled Taylor's trademark registration on Friday.
Taylor had likened her legal battle with Perry to ""David and Goliath"". She told the Sydney Morning Herald after Friday's ruling that she was ""devastated"" with the case outcome.
The appeals judges said it was ""unfortunate"" that the case pitted two enterprising women who used their names as trademarks but were unaware that the other existed.
“Both women put blood, sweat and tears into developing their businesses,” the judges said.
“As the fame of one grew internationally, the other became aware of her namesake and filed a trademark application,” they said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl4dyjg57do,Australia wants to ban kids from social media. Will it work?,2024-11-21T04:04:33.360Z,"Hannah Ritchie
BBC News, Sydney","“I felt really scared to be honest,” says James, describing an incident on Snapchat that left him questioning whether it was safe to go to school.
The Australian boy, 12, had had a disagreement with a friend, and one night before bed the boy added him to a group chat with two older teenagers.
Almost instantly, his phone “started blowing up” with a string of violent messages.
“One of them sounded like he was probably 17,” James tells the BBC. “He sent me videos of him with a machete… he was waving it around. Then there were voice messages saying that they were going to catch me and stab me.”
James - not his real name - first joined Snapchat when he was 10, after a classmate suggested everyone in their friendship group get the app. But after telling his parents about his cyberbullying experience, which was ultimately resolved by his school, James deleted his account.
His experience is a cautionary tale that shows why the Australian government’s proposed social media ban on children under 16 is necessary, says his mother Emma, who is also using a pseudonym.
The laws, which were tabled in parliament's lower house on Thursday, have been billed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as “world-leading”.
But while many parents have applauded the move, some experts have questioned whether kids should - or even can - be barred from accessing social media, and what the adverse effects of doing so may be.
Albanese says the ban - which will cover platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram - is about protecting kids from the “harms” of social media.
""This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood. We want parents to have peace of mind,"" he said on Thursday.
The new legislation provides a ""framework"" for the ban. But the 17-page document, which is expected to head to the Senate next week, is sparse on detail.
Instead, it will be up to the nation’s internet regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to hash out how to implement and enforce the rules, which will not come into effect for at least 12 months after legislation is passed.
According to the bill, the ban will apply to all children under 16 and that there will be no exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.
Tech companies will face penalties of up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7) if they do not comply, but there will be exemptions for platforms which are able to create “low-risk services"" deemed suitable for kids. Criteria for this threshold are yet to be set.
Messaging services and gaming sites, however, will not be restricted, as will some sites that can be accessed without an account like YouTube, which has prompted questions over how regulators will determine what is and isn’t a social media platform in a fast-moving landscape.
A group representing the interests of tech companies such as Meta, Snapchat and X in Australia has dismissed the ban as “a 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges”.
Such legislation could push kids into “dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet”, Digital Industry Group Inc says - a fear also expressed by some experts.
eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant has acknowledged the gargantuan task her office will face when enforcing the ban, given “technology change is always going to outpace policy”.
“It will always be fluid, and this is why regulators like eSafety have to be nimble,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live.
But Ms Inman Grant has also raised concerns about the central idea behind the government’s policy, which is that there’s a causal link between social media and declining mental health.
“I would say that the evidence base is not settled at all,” she said, pointing to research from her own office which found that some of the most vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ or First Nations teenagers, “feel more themselves online than they do in the real world”.
This is a sentiment echoed by Lucas Lane, 15, who runs an online business selling nail polish to boys. “This [ban] destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen,” the Perth teenager tells the BBC.
Ms Inman Grant would rather see tech companies clean up their platforms, as well as more investment in education tools to help young people stay safe online. She uses the analogy of teaching children to swim, rather than banning them from the water.
“We don’t fence the ocean… but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,” she told parliament earlier this year.
But Emma - who has lobbied for the ban through the parent-led Heads Up Alliance - sees it differently.
“Should we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?"" she says.
“Or should we just allow them to be kids and learn how to be sociable outside with each other, and then start these discussions later on?”
Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees.
“We can’t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven’t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren’t ready for it.”
Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as ""too blunt an instrument"" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have “safe access” to digital environments.
It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that’s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations.
To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce ""digital duty of care"" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety.
Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban “could be part of a strategy, it absolutely can’t be the whole strategy”.
She says “the biggest piece of the puzzle” should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media.
The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free “digital literacy tools” to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren’t receiving regular lessons.
Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the “enormous risks” associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online.
The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested.
In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user’s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to “preserve” their privacy.
However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. “I can’t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,” she tells the BBC.
Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online.
In 2011, South Korea passed its “shutdown law” which prevented children under 16 from playing internet games between 22:30 and 6:00, but the rules - which faced backlash - were later scrapped citing the need to “respect the rights of youths”.
More recently France introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent. Research indicated almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN.
A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - ran into a different issue: it was blocked by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional.
Albanese has conceded that Australia's proposal may not be foolproof, and if it passes the parliament, it would be subject to a review.
""We all know technology moves fast and some people will try to find ways around these new laws but that is not a reason to ignore the responsibility that we have,"" he told lawmakers.
But for mothers like Emma and Ms Friedlander - who have lobbied for the changes - it's the message that the ban sends which matters most.
“For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out socially,” Ms Friedlander says.
“We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.”
James says that since quitting Snapchat he’s found himself spending more time outside with friends.
And he hopes that the new laws could enable more kids like him to “get out and do the things they love” instead of feeling pressured to be online.",Australia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz84jy9ypo,Uncertainty after Australia foreign students bill hits opposition,2024-11-21T00:25:28.211Z,"Tiffanie Turnbull
BBC News, Sydney","Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is “not over” despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says.
The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation.
The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week.
However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough.
Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (£25.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy.
Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought ""no sense of relief"" for him.
""I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now,"" said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities.
The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks.
Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector.
The legislation, currently before the Senate, has not been formally withdrawn by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government but it cannot pass without the support of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition or the Greens, who also oppose it.
Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill ""a dog's breakfast"" and vowed to introduce ""deeper cuts"" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May.
The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill ""dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause"".
The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked ""tough"" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years.
The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place.
The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia’s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed.
But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure.
""The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution,"" Mr Sheehy said.
""We're nowhere closer to providing the certainty, stability and growth the government promised us all those many months ago when they proposed caps.""",Australia

BBC News, Sydney","Australian lawmakers have voted to censure an Aboriginal senator who heckled King Charles during his visit to Canberra last month, to express their ""profound disapproval"" of her protest.
Lidia Thorpe shouted ""you are not my King"" and ""this is not your land"" shortly after the King addressed the Great Hall of Parliament, in an effort to highlight the impacts of British colonisation.
The Senate's censure, which passed 46-12, described Thorpe's actions as ""disrespectful and disruptive"" and said they should disqualify her from representing the chamber as a member of any delegation.
A censure motion is politically symbolic but carries no constitutional or legal weight.
Shortly after the Senate vote on Monday, Thorpe told reporters she had been denied her right to respond in the chamber due to a flight delay.
""The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the first peoples of this country... I will not be silent,"" the independent senator said.
Her protest last month drew immediate ire from across the political aisle, as well as from some prominent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders.
But it also drew praise from some activists who argued that it highlighted the plight of Australia's first inhabitants, who endured colonial violence and still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians.
Thorpe is among those who have advocated for a treaty between Australia’s government and its first inhabitants.
Unlike New Zealand and other former British colonies, a treaty with Indigenous peoples in Australia was never established. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people emphasise that they never ceded their sovereignty or land to the Crown.
Despite the protest, the King was warmly greeted by Australian crowds during his five-day tour alongside Queen Camilla.
“You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown. Nothing stands still,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in an official address.
Thorpe has a history of Indigenous activism which has, at times, grabbed global headlines.
During her swearing in ceremony in 2022, the Gunnai, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung woman referred to the Queen Elizabeth II as a coloniser - and was asked to retake her oath after facing criticism.
Last year, Australia decisively rejected a proposal to grant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people constitutional recognition and allow them to establish a body to advise parliament on issues impacting their communities.
The referendum - known as the Voice - became ensnared in a bruising campaign, and both sides of politics have sought to move on swiftly, leaving uncertainty over future policy.
While the data suggests a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn’t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading ‘No’ campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic.",Australia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4nkxv4e4po,India-China relations: Modi's hope for a thaw amid uncertain geopolitics,2025-03-24T00:28:55.410Z,"Michael Kugelman
Foreign policy analyst","In a recent interview, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke positively about India's relationship with long-time rival China. He said normalcy had returned to the disputed India-China border and called for stronger ties.
These are striking comments, because tensions have been high since a nasty border clash in the northern Ladakh region in 2020 - the deadliest since a 1962 war.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning expressed appreciation for Modi's words and declared that ""the two countries should be partners that contribute to each other's success"".
Modi's pitch for closer partnership isn't actually as big of a leap as it may seem, given recent improvements in bilateral ties. But the relationship remains strained, and much will need to fall into place - bilaterally and more broadly geopolitically - for it to enjoy a true rapprochement.
India-China ties have many bright spots.
Bilateral trade is consistently robust; even after the Ladakh clash, China has been India's top trade partner. They co-operate multilaterally, from Brics, the alliance of major developing countries, to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. They share interests in advancing non-Western economic models, countering Islamist terrorism and rejecting what they deem US moral crusading.
Even after the Ladakh clash sunk ties to their lowest level in decades, the two militaries continued to hold high-level dialogues, which resulted in a deal in October to resume border patrols. Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Brics summit in Russia that month and they pledged further co-operation. In January, the two sides agreed to resume direct flights.
Still, the relationship remains troubled.
Each side has close security ties with the other's main competitor: India with the US and China with Pakistan.
China opposes Indian policies in the disputed Kashmir region. Beijing frustrates India's great power ambitions by blocking its membership in influential groupings like the Nuclear Suppliers Group and permanent membership on the UN Security Council.
China has a large naval presence, and its only overseas military base, in India's broader maritime backyard.
The Belt and Road Initiative, the connectivity corridor through which Beijing has expanded its footprint in India's neighbourhood, is categorically rejected by Delhi for passing through India-claimed territory.
Meanwhile, India is deepening ties with Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province. It hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. Beijing regards him as a dangerous separatist.
India is negotiating sales of supersonic missiles to Southeast Asian states that could be used to deter Chinese provocations in the South China Sea. China views several global forums to which India belongs, such as the Indo-Pacific Quad and the Middle East Europe Economic Corridor, as attempts to counter it.
There are several signposts to watch to get a better sense of the relationship's future trajectory.
One is border talks. Fifty thousand squares miles of the 2,100-mile (3,380km)-long frontier - an area equal to the size of Greece - remain disputed.
The situation on the border is the biggest bellwether of the relationship. The Ladakh clash shattered trust; last year's patrolling deal helped restore it. If the two sides can produce more confidence-building measures, this would bode well for relations.
Future high-level engagement is also important. If Modi and Xi, both of whom place a premium on personal diplomacy, meet this year, this would bolster recent momentum in bilateral ties. They'll have opportunities on the sidelines of leaders summits for Brics in July, G20 in November and the Shanghai Co-operation Group (SCO) sometime later this year.
Another key signpost is Chinese investment, which would bring critical capital to key Indian industries from manufacturing to renewables and help ease India's $85bn (£65.7bn) trade deficit with China.
An increase in such investments would give India a timely economic boost and China more access to the world's fastest-growing major economy. Stronger commercial co-operation would provide more incentives to keep broader tensions down.
Regional and global developments are also worth watching.
Four of India's neighbours - Bangladesh, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka - recently had new leaders take office who are more pro-China than their predecessors. But so far, they've sought to balance ties with Beijing and Delhi, not align with China.
If this continues, Delhi's concerns about Beijing's influence in India's neighbourhood could lessen a bit. Additionally, if China were to pull back from its growing partnership with India's close friend Russia - a more likely outcome if there's an end to the war in Ukraine, which has deepened Moscow's dependence on Beijing - this could help India-China ties.
The Trump factor looms large, too.
US President Donald Trump, despite slapping tariffs on China, has telegraphed a desire to ease tensions with Beijing.
If he does, and Delhi fears Washington may not be as committed to helping India counter China, then India would want to ensure its own ties with China are in a better place.
Additionally, if Trump's impending reciprocal tariff policy hits India hard - and given the 10% average tariff differentials between the US and India, it certainly could - India will have another incentive to strengthen commercial cooperation with Beijing.
India and China are Asia's two largest countries, and both view themselves as proud civilisation states.
They're natural competitors. But recent positive developments in ties, coupled with the potential for bilateral progress on other fronts, could bring more stability to the relationship - and ensure Modi's conciliatory language isn't mere rhetoric.

BBC News","South Korean K-pop group NewJeans have announced they are taking a break from all activities, after a court ruled against them in their ongoing dispute with their record label Ador.
The five-piece, who have attempted to rebrand as NJZ, announced during a show at ComplexCon Hong Kong on Sunday that ""this will be our last performance for a little while"", after debuting their new song Pit Stop.
The court ruling on Friday forbade the group from organising their own appearances, making music or signing advertising deals during their dispute with Ador.
NewJeans are seeking to cut ties with Ador after accusing them of mistreatment, and have said they will challenge the court's ruling.
The group have been embroiled in a lengthy dispute with their record label since August 2024, when Hybe, the parent company of Ador, allegedly forced out NewJeans' mentor, Min Hee-Jin.
The band issued an ultimatum demanding that Min should be restored – and, when Hybe refused, went public with a number of complaints against the label, including the claim it had deliberately undermined their careers.
One of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.
In a press conference in November, NewJeans announced their departure from the company, saying Hybe and Ador had lost the right to represent them as artists.
The Seoul court ruled that NewJeans' claims did not ""sufficiently prove that Ador violated their significant duty as part of their contract"", adding that the music label had upheld ""most of its duty including payment"".
The court's decision prevents the band from conducting independent activities, which means it will face difficulty rebranding under its new name, NJZ, without facing severe financial penalties for breach of contract.
The Hong Kong concert on Sunday night marked the group's first public appearance since the ruling.
After debuting their new song, the five members Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Heyin took turns to read a letter addressing their fans in English and Korean.
""This stage means so much to us and every single one of you who gives us strength just by being here,"" Hanni and Dani said.
""It is really hard for us to say this, but this might be our last performance for a little while. Out of respect for the court's decision, we've decided to pause all our activities for now.
""It wasn't an easy decision,"" they added, ""but we believe this is something we need to do at this moment.""
The group also said that the decision was ""about protecting ourselves so that we can come back even stronger"".
""We had to speak up to protect the values that we believe in, and that was a choice that we don't regret at all,"" they added.
""We surely believe that standing up for our dignity, our rights and everything we deeply care about is something we had to do, and that belief will not change.""
The speech ended an hour-long headlining set in front of a crowd of more than 11,000 fans at the AsiaWorld Expo Arena, Hong Kong's largest live music venue.
The group performed under their new name NJZ, in seeming defiance of last week's ruling.
In a statement on Monday, Ador said they ""regret the members' decision to proceed with a performance under a name other than NewJeans, despite the court order, and their unilateral announcement of a suspension of activities"".
""Ador is fully committed to supporting NewJeans, consistent with the terms of our legally valid exclusive contract,"" they added. ""We hope to meet with the artists as soon as possible to discuss the path forward.""
NewJeans are considered one of the brightest new bands in K-Pop, and were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world in 2023.",Asia

More than 200 residents were ordered to leave their homes in eight villages because of the deadly fire in Sancheong County in South Gyeongsang province.

BBC News","South Korea's constitutional court has dismissed the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating him as the country's acting president.
Han took over as acting leader last December when President Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from duties and impeached by parliament after he attempted to declare martial law.
However, Han only lasted two weeks in power before lawmakers voted to impeach him as well. Since then, South Korea has been led by deputy prime minister Choi Sang-mok.
South Korea has been roiled by political chaos since Yoon's botched attempt to impose martial law.
Shortly after assuming the role of acting president, Han blocked the appointment of new judges to the constitutional court - something the opposition had hoped would improve the odds of Yoon getting impeached.
As a result, they voted to impeach Han.
But on Monday, the judges ruled seven to one to strike down the impeachment.
""I thank the constitutional court for its wise decision,"" Han said after the ruling was announced. ""I will work to bring the government to order.""
South Korea remains on tenterhooks for another upcoming decision by the same court - on the impeachment of President Yoon.
Lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon on 14 December, but it is ultimately up to the constitutional court to decide.
If the court votes to uphold the impeachment, Yoon would be immediately removed from office and South Korea must hold a presidential election within 60 days. If it dismisses the impeachment, Yoon would return to his duties immediately.
The court date has not yet been set for the Yoon verdict, but in recent weeks Seoul has seen swelling protests from Yoon's supporters and opponents, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets of the nation's capital last weekend.
Political analyst Leif-Eric Easley said the dismissal of Han's impeachment shows that the constitutional court ""wants to appear impartial, upholding the law and encouraging national stability during a messy political transition"".
It ""serves to admonish progressive parties for their overzealousness in impeaching government officials"", said Dr Easley. He noted that opposition lawmakers have filed several impeachment motions, and the court has dismissed the nine cases it has ruled on so far.
""Reinstating Han is also partly political theatre setting up its more consequential ruling on Yoon's impeachment."" Dr Easley added.
""Mostly siding with conservatives on Han's case can be seen as a play for unity and legitimacy"" for when the court votes on Yoon's fate in coming days, he said.",Asia

BBC News","The family of a British couple in their seventies who have been detained in Afghanistan have expressed fears for their health after a court appearance was delayed.
Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were arrested on 1 February while returning to their home in Bamiyan province.
They were taken out of jail for court proceedings on Saturday and spent four hours sitting on the floor, chained to other prisoners before being returned to prison, according to their daughter.
Sarah Entwistle added that her mother was ""collapsing due to malnutrition"" and that her father's health was ""declining"", saying that they have ""no charges against them"".
She said that on Saturday, the couple had been informed ""at the last minute"" that they would not be seen by the judge.
""The guards indicated that a different judge would now be handling the case, and we continue to hope they will receive a fair hearing in the coming week,"" she said.
The couple are being held separately and did not see each other on Saturday.
Before their arrest, Mr and Mrs Reynolds, who married in the Afghan capital Kabul in 1970, had been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years - including one that involved training mothers and children.
Their work had apparently been approved by the local authorities despite the Taliban banning education for girls over 12-years-old and not allowing women to work.
The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 2022, and in December 2024, it said it would close any NGOs employing women.
Mrs Reynolds is only being given one meal a day and needed help to climb the four flights of stairs to the room where the judge sits, according to her daughter.
""Mum's health is rapidly deteriorating, and she is collapsing due to malnutrition,"" she said. ""She and the other women are provided only one meal a day, while the men receive three.""
She added: ""Dad's health is also still declining, and he's experiencing tremors in his head and left arm.""
The family appealed last week to the Taliban to release them as a goodwill gesture during Ramadan.
Their daughter said there are ""still no charges against them and no evidence of any crime has been submitted"".
""We are, of course, devastated by this delay,"" she said. ""It makes little sense, especially given that the Taliban have repeatedly stated that this situation is due to misunderstandings, and that they will be released 'soon'.""
In a statement to the BBC on 24 February, Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: ""A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible.""
The UK has shut its embassy in Kabul and withdrew its diplomats from the country after the Taliban returned to power.

BBC Urdu
Reporting fromBalochistan","Saira Baloch was 15 when she stepped into a morgue for the first time.
All she heard in the dimly-lit room were sobs, whispered prayers and shuffling feet. The first body she saw was a man who appeared to have been tortured.
His eyes were missing, his teeth had been pulled out and there were burn marks on his chest.
""I couldn't look at the other bodies. I walked out,"" she recalled.
But she was relieved. It wasn't her brother - a police officer who had been missing for nearly a year since he was arrested in 2018 in a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan, one of Pakistan's most restive regions.
Inside the morgue, others continued their desperate search, scanning rows of unclaimed corpses. Saira would soon adopt this grim routine, revisiting one morgue after another. They were all the same: tube lights flickering, the air thick with the stench of decay and antiseptic.
On every visit, she hoped she would not find what she was looking for - seven years on, she still hasn't.
Activists say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan's security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency.
The Pakistan government denies the allegations, insisting that many of the missing have joined separatist groups or fled the country.
Some return after years, traumatised and broken - but many never come back. Others are found in unmarked graves that have appeared across Balochistan, their bodies so disfigured they cannot be identified.
And then there are the women across generations whose lives are being defined by waiting.
Young and old, they take part in protests, their faces lined with grief, holding up fading photographs of men no longer in their lives. When the BBC met them at their homes, they offered us black tea - Sulemani chai - in chipped cups as they spoke in voices worn down by sorrow.
Many of them insist their fathers, brothers and sons are innocent and have been targeted for speaking out against state policies or were taken as a form of collective punishment.
Saira is one of them.
She says she started going to protests after asking the police and pleading with politicians yielded no answers about her brother's whereabouts.
Muhammad Asif Baloch was arrested in August 2018 along with 10 others in Nushki, a city along the border with Afghanistan. His family found out when they saw him on TV the next day, looking scared and dishevelled.
Authorities said the men were ""terrorists fleeing to Afghanistan"". Muhammad's family said he was having a picnic with friends.
Saira says Muhammad was her ""best friend"", funny and always cheerful - ""My mother worries that she's forgetting his smile.""
The day he went missing, Saira had aced a school exam and was excited to tell her brother, her ""biggest supporter"". Muhammad had encouraged her to attend universty in Quetta, the provincial capital.
""I didn't know back then that the first time I'd go to Quetta, it would be for a protest demanding his release,"" Saira says.
Three of the men who were detained along with her brother were released in 2021, but they have not spoken about what happened.
Muhammad never came home.
The journey into Balochistan, in Pakistan's south-west, feels like you are stepping into another world.
It is vast - covering about 44% of the country, the largest of Pakistan's provinces - and the land is rich with gas, coal, copper and gold. It stretches along the Arabian Sea, across the water from places like Dubai, which has risen from the sands into glittering, monied skyscrapers.
But Balochistan remains stuck in time. Access to many parts is restricted for security reasons and foreign journalists are often denied access.
It's also difficult to travel around. The roads are long and lonely, cutting through barren hills and desert. As the infrastructure thins out the further you travel, roads are replaced by dirt tracks created by the few vehicles that pass.
Electricity is sporadic, water even scarcer. Schools and hospitals are dismal.
In the markets, men sit outside mud shops waiting for customers who rarely come. Boys, who elsewhere in Pakistan may dream of a career, only talk of escape: fleeing to Karachi, to the Gulf, to anywhere that offers a way out of this slow suffocation.
Balochistan became a part of Pakistan in 1948, in the upheaval that followed the partition of British India - and in spite of opposition from some influential tribal leaders, who sought an independent state.
Some of the resistance turned militant and, over the years, it has been stoked by accusations that Pakistan has exploited the resource-rich region without investing in its development.
Militant groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), designated a terrorist group by Pakistan and other nations, have intensified their attacks: bombings, assassinations and ambushes against security forces have become more frequent.
Earlier this month, the BLA hijacked a train in Bolan Pass, seizing hundreds of passengers. They demanded the release of missing people in Balochistan in return for freeing hostages.
The siege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.
The disappearances in the province are widely believed to be part of Islamabad's strategy to crush the insurgency - but also to suppress dissent, weaken nationalist sentiment and support for an independent Balochistan.
Many of the missing are suspected members or sympathisers of Baloch nationalist groups that demand more autonomy or independence. But a significant number are ordinary people with no known political affiliations.
Balochistan's Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti told the BBC that enforced disappearances are an issue but dismissed the idea that they were happening on a large scale as ""systematic propaganda"".
""Every child in Balochistan has been made to hear 'missing persons, missing persons'. But who will determine who disappeared whom?
""Self-disappearances exist too. How can I prove if someone was taken by intelligence agencies, police, FC, or anyone else or me or you?""
Pakistan's military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif recently said in a press conference that the ""state is solving the issue of missing persons in a systematic manner"".
He repeated the official statistic often shared by the government - of the more than 2,900 cases of enforced disappearances reported from Balochistan since 2011, 80% had been resolved.
Activists put the figure higher - at around 7,000 – but there is no single reliable source of data and no way to verify either side's claims.
Women like Jannat Bibi refuse to accept the official number.
She continues to search for her son, Nazar Muhammad, who she claims was taken in 2012 while eating breakfast at a hotel.
""I went everywhere looking for him. I even went to Islamabad,"" she says. ""All I got were beatings and rejection.""
The 70-year-old lives in a small mud house on the outskirts of Quetta, not far from a symbolic graveyard dedicated to the missing.
Jannat, who runs a tiny shop selling biscuits and milk cartons, often can't afford the bus fare to attend protests demanding information about the missing. But she borrows what she can so she can keep going.
""Silence is not an option,"" she says.
Most of these men - including those whose families we spoke to - disappeared after 2006.
That was the year a key Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed in a military operation, leading to a rise in anti-state protests and armed insurgent activities.
The government cracked down in response - enforced disappearances increased, as did the number of bodies found on the streets.
In 2014, mass graves of missing people were discovered in Tootak – a small town near the city of Khuzdar, where Saira lives, 275km (170 miles) south of Quetta.
The bodies were disfigured beyond identification. The images from Tootak shook the country - but the horror was no stranger to people in Balochistan.
Mahrang Baloch's father, a famous nationalist leader who fought for Baloch rights, had disappeared in early 2009. Abdul Gaffar Langove had worked for the Pakistani government but left the job to advocate for what he believed would be a safer Balochistan.
Three years later Mahrang received a phone call that his body had been found in Lasbela district in the south of the province.
""When my father's body arrived, he was wearing the same clothes, now torn. He had been badly tortured,"" she says. For five years, she had nightmares about his final days. She visited his grave ""to convince myself that he was no longer alive and that he was not being tortured"".
She hugged his grave ""hoping to feel him, but it didn't happen"".
When he was arrested, Mahrang used to write him letters - ""lots of letters and I would draw greeting cards and send them to him on Eid"". But he returned the cards, saying his prison cell was no place for such ""beautiful"" cards. He wanted her to keep them at home.
""I still miss his hugs,"" she says.
After her father's death, Mahrang says, her family's world ""collapsed"".
And then in 2017, her brother was picked up by security forces, according to the family, and detained for nearly three months.
""It was terrifying. I made my mother believe that what happened to my father wouldn't happen to my brother. But it did,"" Mahrang says. ""I was scared of looking at my phone, because it might be news of my brother's body being found somewhere.""
She says her mother and she found strength in each other: ""Our tiny house was our safest place, where we would sometimes sit and cry for hours. But outside, we were two strong women who couldn't be crushed.""
It was then that Mahrang decided to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Today, the 32-year-old leads the protest movement despite death threats, legal cases and travel bans.
""We want the right to live on our own land without persecution. We want our resources, our rights. We want this rule of fear and violence to end.""
Mahrang warns that enforced disappearances fuel more resistance, rather than silence it.
""They think dumping bodies will end this. But how can anyone forget losing their loved one this way? No human can endure this.""
She demands institutional reforms, ensuring that no mother has to send her child away in fear. ""We don't want our children growing up in protest camps. Is that too much to ask?""
Mahrang was arrested on Saturday morning, a few weeks after her interview with the BBC.
She was leading a protest in Quetta after 13 unclaimed bodies - feared to be missing persons - were buried in the city. Authorities claimed they were militants killed after the Bolan Pass train hijacking, though this could not be independently verified.
Earlier Mahrang had said: ""I could be arrested anytime. But I don't fear it. This is nothing new for us.""
And even as she fights for the future she wants, a new generation is already on the streets.
Masooma, 10, clutches her school bag tightly as she weaves through the crowd of protesters, her eyes scanning every face, searching for one that looks like her father's.
""Once, I saw a man and thought he was my father. I ran to him and then realised he was someone else,"" she says.
""Everyone's father comes home after work. I have never found mine.""
Masooma was just three months old when security forces allegedly took her father away during a late-night raid in Quetta.
Her mother was told he would return in a few hours. He never did.
Today, Masooma spends more time at protests than in the classroom. Her father's photograph is always with her, tucked safely in her school bag.
Before every lesson begins, she takes it out and looks at it.
""I always wonder if my father will come home today.""
She stands outside the protest camp, chanting slogans with the others, her small frame lost in the crowd of grieving families.
As the protest comes to an end she sits cross-legged on a thin mat in a quiet corner. The noise of slogans and traffic fades as she pulls out her folded letters - letters she has written but could never send.
Her fingers tremble as she smooths out the creases, and in a fumbling, uncertain voice, she begins to read them.
""Dear Baba Jan, when will you come back? Whenever I eat or drink water, I miss you. Baba, where are you? I miss you so much. I am alone. Without you, I cannot sleep. I just want to meet you and see your face.""",Asia

BBC News","A South Korean court has ruled against chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans which had sought to cut ties with its record label Ador.
The court said the band, which had renamed themselves NJZ and began organising their own appearances, must not conduct any independent activities - from making music to signing advertising deals.
Earlier last year, NewJeans said that they were leaving Ador, after accusing them of mistreatment. Ador subsequently sued to have NewJeans' contracts upheld and, after accusing the group of trying to sign independent deals without its approval, filed an injunction against them in January.
The group has said that they will challenge Friday's decision.
The court's ruling casts some uncertainty around the release of the group's new song, slated for Sunday.
It also means they will now face difficulty re-debuting under their new name, NJZ, without facing severe financial penalties for breach of contract.
NewJeans and Ador have been embroiled in a dramatic dispute since August 2024, when Hybe, the parent company of Ador, allegedly forced out NewJeans' mentor, Min Hee-Jin.

On Friday, the Seoul court ruled that NewJeans' claims did not ""sufficiently prove that Ador violated their significant duty as part of their contract"", adding that the music label had upheld ""most of its duty including payment"".
""If [NewJeans] unilaterally terminate the contract, Ador would suffer greatly. And if [NewJeans] begins activity under a new name, it could severely damage not only the brand of NewJeans but the reputation of Ador,"" the court's statement reads.
The group says they respect the ruling but has argued that they did not have sufficient opportunity to fully present their case to the court.
""We plan to challenge today's decision... during which we will raise additional legal issues and submit further supporting evidence,"" they responded in a statement just hours after the ruling.
""Regardless... we can no longer remain with a management that has disrespected our identities and undermined our achievements.""
A lawsuit regarding the validity of the two parties' contract termination is still underway.
The five band members – Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein – have over the past few months continued to assert their independence, creating a new Instagram account under the name ""jeanzforfree"".
They have also said they would fight to keep their name, and their career, and would remain ""NewJeans at heart"" even if they lost the fight against Ador.
NewJeans were considered one of the brightest new bands in K-Pop, thanks to a playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies.
In 2023, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world. Last year, they picked up a nomination for best group at the MTV Awards.",Asia

Reporting fromJakarta","Indonesia's parliament has passed controversial changes to legislation that will allow its military a bigger role in government.
Critics warn that the move could return Indonesia to the dark days of Suharto's military dictatorship, which lasted 32 years until he was forced out of office in 1998.
The revisions backed by President Prabowo Subianto - a former special forces commander and Suharto's son-in-law - allow military officers to take up positions in government without first retiring or resigning from the armed forces.
Hundreds of pro-democracy activists have camped outside parliament since Wednesday evening to protest at the changes.
""The essence of democracy is that the military should not engage in politics. The military should only manage barracks and national defence,"" said Wilson, an activist with the Indonesian Association of Families of the Disappeared (KontraS), a group advocating for activists who disappeared during a crackdown in 1997 and 1998.
""Since 1998, there has been a creeping murder of democracy. And today marks its peak. Democracy has been killed by the House of Representatives,"" Wilson told the BBC.
The revisions allow active military personnel to hold positions in 14 civilian institutions, up from 10. They also raise retirement age by several years for most ranks. Highest-ranking four-star generals can now serve until 63, up from 60.
By Thursday evening, the crowd of protesters outside parliament had grown to nearly a thousand. ""Return the military to the barracks!"" ""Against militarism and oligarchy,"" read the banners they held.
Police officers and military personnel stood guard around the protesters.
While there have been efforts over the past 25 years to limit the military's involvement in politics and governance, local human rights watchdog Imparsial found that nearly 2,600 active-duty officers were serving in civilian roles even before the law's revision.
The changes signal a ""broader consolidation of power"" under Prabowo, said Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel.
That the main opposition party endorsed the changes - despite initial opposition - further underscores this shift, he noted.
""By embedding military perspectives into civilian domains, the legislation could reshape Indonesia's policy direction, potentially prioritising stability and state control over democratic governance and civil liberties,"" Mr Dinarto said.
The armed forces' ""dual function"", where they are given control of security and administrative affairs, was central to Suharto's regime.
For some Indonesians, Prabowo epitomises that authoritarian era. It was he who led the special forces unit accused of abducting activists in 1997 and 1998.
Many had feared that his return to political power and becoming president would erode Indonesia's hard-won but fragile democracy.
Since taking office last October, Prabowo has already been expanding the military's involvement in public areas. His flagship $4bn free-meal programme for children and pregnant women, for instance, receives logistical support from the armed forces.
Defending the amendments on Thursday, defence minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament ""geopolitical changes and global military technology"" require the military to transform to tackle ""conventional and non conventional conflicts"".
""We will never disappoint the Indonesians in keeping our sovereignty,"" he said.
However some rights groups argue that increasing military control in public affairs beyond defence will undermine impartiality.
""How can active-duty officers in the Attorney General's Office remain impartial when they are still bound by military command?"" asked Virdika Rizky Utama, a researcher at Jakarta-based think-tank PARA Syndicate, Benar News reports.
""If the military gains influence over the justice system, who will hold them accountable?""
""President Prabowo appears intent on restoring the Indonesian military's role in civilian affairs, which were long characterised by widespread abuses and impunity,"" said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""The government's rush to adopt these amendments undercuts its expressed commitment to human rights and accountability.""
KontraS also noted that the government's ""rush to amend the [law] stands in stark contrast to its prolonged inaction on other critical human rights commitments"".
""This long struggle cannot stop just because the law has been passed. There is only one word: Resist,"" said Sukma Ayu, an undergraduate at Universitas Muhammadiyah Prof. Hamka in Jakarta.
""We will continue protesting until we claim victory... We have no choice but to occupy the 'house of the people',"" she said.",Asia

BBC News","Four Canadians were executed in China on drug-related charges earlier this year, Canadian authorities have confirmed.
All of them were dual citizens and their identities have been withheld, Canada's foreign minister Mélanie Joly said.
A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canada urged Ottawa to ""stop making irresponsible remarks"", as pundits feared a further downturn in relations between the countries after years of strain.
China's foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had acted ""in accordance with the law"", while the embassy said there was ""solid and sufficient"" evidence for their crimes.
Beijing had ""fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned"", the embassy said, urging Canada to respect ""China's judicial sovereignty"".
China does not recognise dual citizenship and takes a tough stance on drug crimes. However, it's rare for the death penalty to be carried out on foreigners.
Joly said she had been following the cases ""very closely"" for months and had tried with other officials, including former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to stop the executions.
In a statement to Canadian media, Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said Canada had ""repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere"".
China imposes the death penalty on serious crimes including those related to drugs, corruption and espionage. While the number of executions are kept secret, human rights groups believe China has one of the highest execution rates in the world.
""These shocking and inhumane executions of Canadian citizens by Chinese authorities should be a wake-up call for Canada,"" said Ketty Nivyabandi, from Amnesty International Canada. ""We are devastated for the families of the victims, and we hold them in our hearts as they try to process the unimaginable.
""Our thoughts also go to the loved ones of Canadian citizens whom China is holding on death row or whose whereabouts in the Chinese prison system are unknown.""
In 2019, Canadian national Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was sentenced to death in China for drug smuggling, in a high-profile case condemned by the Canadian government. He was not among the Canadians who were executed.
""We'll continue to not only strongly condemn but also ask for leniency for other Canadians that are facing similar situations,"" Joly said on Wednesday.
Relations between Canada and China have been icy since 2018, after Canada detained a Chinese telecom executive, Meng Wanzhou, on a US extradition request. China arrested two Canadians shortly afterwards, both of whom have now been released.
In 2023, Canadian media released reports, many based on leaked intelligence, about detailed claims of Chinese meddling in the country's federal elections. China denied the reports, calling them ""baseless and defamatory"".
More recently, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports after Ottawa placed levies on Chinese electric vehicles, steel and aluminium.",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyd0l5w6l6o,Reprieve for Afghan women students facing forced return after US aid cuts,2025-03-19T16:13:08.770Z,"Yogita Limaye
South Asia and Afghanistan correspondent","More than 80 Afghan women studying in Oman on US-funded scholarships - terminated last month due to Trump administration's sweeping cuts to foreign aid - have received a temporary reprieve.
A US State Department spokesperson has told the BBC that funding will continue until 30 June, 2025.
""This is great news, and we are very grateful,"" one student told the BBC, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. ""But I hope there will be a permanent solution.""
The women fled Taliban ruled Afghanistan to continue their studies abroad, but the abrupt freeze on US Agency for International Development (USAID) funds put them at risk of being sent back.
Since regaining power in Afghanistan nearly four years ago, the Taliban has imposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from universities.
The students in Oman were pursuing graduate and post-graduate degrees under the Women's Scholarship Endowment (WSE), a USAID program launched in 2018 to fund studies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
On 28 February, they were informed their scholarships were ending and that they would be sent back to Afghanistan within two weeks, prompting ""shock and tears"".
""We are relieved now, but we are still deeply concerned about our future,"" a student said. ""If the scholarship is not renewed, we will be left with no option but to return to Afghanistan, where we cannot study, and our safety could be under threat as well.""
The US government has not responded to the BBC's inquiries on when a final decision will be made.
The BBC has also contacted the government of Oman to find out whether it is seeking alternative funding.
Afghanistan's Taliban government says it has been trying to resolve the issue of women's education, but has also defended its supreme leader's diktats, saying they are ""in accordance with Islamic Sharia law"".
It has cracked down on women protesting for education and work, with many activists beaten, detained and threatened.
Women in Afghanistan describe themselves as ""dead bodies moving around"" under the regime's policies.
Before the funding extension, a WSE staff member had told the BBC they were urgently ""searching for alternative funding sources"". Calling the situation ""dangerous and devastating"", the staff member warned that the students could face persecution and forced marriages upon return to Afghanistan.
The women, mostly in their 20s, qualified for scholarships in 2021 before the Taliban seized Afghanistan. Many continued their studies in Afghan universities until December 2022, when the Taliban banned higher education for women.
After 18 months in limbo, they said they fled to Pakistan last September.
USAID then facilitated their visas to Oman, where they arrived between October and November 2024.
The decision to slash American aid funding has come under the Trump administration, and been implemented by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

BBC News","A former engineer at a Chinese research institute has been sentenced to death for selling classified material to foreign spy agencies, Chinese authorities said.
After he resigned from the institute, the researcher, identified by his surname Liu, came up with a ""carefully designed"" plan to sell intelligence to foreign agencies, according to an article published on Wednesday by China's Ministry of State Security.
The ministry did not name Liu's former employer or the foreign groups that allegedly bought his material.
The announcement comes amid increasing warnings from China that its citizens are being co-opted by foreign entities to serve as spies.
""Desperadoes who want to take shortcuts to heaven will all suffer consequences,"" the ministry said in Wednesday's article.
Believing that he had been treated unfairly at the institute, Liu saved a large amount of classified material before he left, intending to use it for revenge and blackmail, the ministry stated.
He then joined an investment firm and, after failed investments drove him into debt, approached a foreign spy agency which got the material from him at a ""very low price"", according to the ministry.
This agency subsequently cut off contact with Liu, the ministry added, and he tried to sell the information abroad.
""In half a year, he secretly travelled to many countries and seriously leaked our country's secrets,"" the article said.
Liu, who confessed after being arrested, has been stripped of political rights for life.
Beijing has been increasingly wary of espionage, and warned that its citizens are being recruited by foreign spy agencies trying to secure Chinese state secrets.
Last November, a former employee at a Chinese state agency was handed the death sentence after his USB work flash drive was allegedly seized by foreign spies and he became their ""puppet"", according to Chinese authorities.
In February last year, Australian writer Yang Hengjun, known for blogging about human rights issues in China, was handed a suspended death sentence on espionage charges. That sentence was upheld, and Yang remains behind bars in China, despite Australian leaders calling for his release.
Concerns about Chinese influence and infiltration operations are also brewing among governments across the world, several of which have in recent years stepped up arrests of Chinese nationals on espionage charges.",Asia

Cricket writer","As Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 unfolds, all eyes are on MS Dhoni who continues to command superstar status in Indian cricket despite retiring from the international game in 2020.
Dhoni continues to be a key figure in the world's richest cricket league.
Alongside him are veterans like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, and emerging stars like Shubman Gill, Yashaswi Jaiswal, and Rishabh Pant. They are among the players who led India to two ICC titles in the past nine months - the T20 World Cup in June and the Champions Trophy last month.
Yet it is Dhoni who still commands unrivalled attention, with his leadership and presence in the league continuing to captivate fans.
The cricketer, who turns 44 in July, is playing his 18th straight IPL season, 16 of these representing Chennai Super Kings (CSK). He is the oldest player in the tournament this year, though not the oldest to have played in the IPL.
Australian spin bowler Brad Hogg was 45 years and 92 days old when he last played in the IPL in 2016, representing Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Leg-spinner Pravin Tambe, the oldest debutant at 41 years and 212 days for Rajasthan Royals, played his final match in 2019 at 44 years and 219 days, capping an astonishing career.
Whether Dhoni will surpass Tambe and Hogg remains to be seen. Three seasons ago, when he gave up the CSK captaincy, his retirement seemed imminent. Last year, his infrequent appearances suggested the same. However, CSK used the retention clause in the IPL mega-auction to keep Dhoni for the 2025 season as an uncapped player, given his five-year absence from international cricket.
In 18 IPL seasons, Dhoni has scored 5,243 runs, placing him sixth on the all-time run list, currently topped by Kohli.
His career batting average of 39.12 is higher than both Rohit Sharma and Kohli, and trails only David Warner (40.52) and AB de Villiers (39.70) among players with more than 5,000 runs in the league.
Among players with over 5,000 runs, Dhoni's strike rate of 137.53 ranks behind only de Villiers (151.68) and Warner (139.77).
In sixes, Dhoni (252) trails only Gayle (357), Sharma (280) and Kohli (272).
These batting stats highlight just one aspect of Dhoni's prowess. As a wicketkeeper, he boasts 180 dismissals (141 catches, 39 stumpings), a record unmatched by anyone. His quick reflexes and deft glovework earned him the nickname ""pickpocket"" from former Indian coach Ravi Shastri.
The ""helicopter shot"", a flick-drive played over mid-wicket with a wrist-flex of the bottom hand, became the signature stroke of his batting brilliance.
The other notable aspect of his batting was his ability to control the match, taking the innings deep, virtually to the end, with a remarkable control of nerves, and interspersed with explosive strokes. He also ran like a hare between wickets, making him India's best match-winner in his prime years.
Dhoni holds the record for most IPL matches as captain (210) and most wins (123), leading CSK to five IPL titles and two Champions League titles.
He also captained India to three ICC titles: the T20 World Cup (2007), ODI World Cup (2011) and Champions Trophy (2013).
Additionally, his impact in Test cricket is immense, having played 90 Tests and guiding India to the No1 ICC ranking before his sudden retirement mid-series in 2014-15.
Former Indian captains Sunil Gavaskar and Shastri have frequently hailed him as India's finest cricketer ever. While this is open to debate, that Dhoni belongs to the same cluster as Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar and Kapil Dev is now widely acknowledged.
So what does the current season hold for him?
Advancing age has taken a physical toll on Dhoni, though he remains mentally tough and highly competitive. Last season, he stepped away from his finisher role, which he'd held since the league's inception, and adapted his approach to provide valuable cameos that could impact the outcome.
With the impact player rule - which allows teams to pick an extra specialist batter or bowler based on the game situation - now an integral part of the IPL, Dhoni could well settle into this role, while continuing to be a sounding board for the captain and mentor to the squad in a non-designated informal manner.
For CSK, keeping Dhoni in the squad is a no-brainer. His appeal extends beyond CSK fans, offering massive commercial and branding benefits to both the franchise and the IPL. As CSK puts it, an IPL without Dhoni is ""unthinkable"".
This may limit opportunities for young players, both Indian and overseas, but Ravi Shastri dismisses this argument. ""The league operates on free-market dynamics. Franchise owners aren't sentimental - they know what's best for them, on and off the field,"" he says.
Meanwhile, former India opener Robin Uthappa, who played under Dhoni for both India and CSK, warns rivals: ""Write off Dhoni at your own risk. We could still see some old magic.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx281dlxll2o,Dear Daughter: I too feel ugly sometimes,2025-03-21T23:09:56.767Z,"Hatty Nash
BBC World Service","Kalki Koechlin has acted in blockbuster Bollywood films, modelled for international beauty brands and appeared on the cover of Vogue India. But in a world that puts such a premium on looking young, she says at times she feels ""ugly"".
""We live in a social [media] world that has distorted beauty,"" the actor, writer and producer tells the award-winning BBC World Service podcast Dear Daughter. ""It has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour or a certain shape.""
The half-hour programme features letters from parents to their children - in which they pass on the advice and life lessons which matter to them - and a conversation with the show's host Namulanta Kombo.
Kalki's letter is addressed to her five-year-old daughter. In it, she offers advice for navigating pressures around body image and describes the ways unrealistic beauty standards have affected her personally.
The actor, who lives in Goa in India with her husband Israeli musician Guy Hershberg and their daughter, says the inspiration for the letter came to her when, one day after school, the child came to her to say she didn't feel pretty.
""When they're so young, they're so perfect and you think, 'Oh my goodness. How is it possible that you could think you're not pretty?!'"" she says on the podcast.
In the letter, Kalki, who is herself the host of another BBC podcast, My Indian Life, writes that she also feels ""ugly sometimes, even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful"".
She advises her daughter that ""beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently"".
""Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life. They are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs. They are your friends for life,"" she writes.
Born in Puducherry, India, to French parents, Kalki describes herself as a ""geeky introvert"" while growing up. As a teenager, she says, she was uncomfortable with her appearance, and pursuing a career on camera only intensified those feelings.
""Becoming a celebrity, having your face out there and being in front of the camera… There's another layer of self-consciousness that kicks in.""
Working in the film industry, she says she experienced a particular pressure to maintain a youthful appearance. Once, she says, a producer even suggested over lunch that she get dermal fillers for her wrinkles.
""He said, 'All you need is a little filler for your laughter lines.' I smiled and said, 'Well, I better stop smiling so much.' So I think my approach has been to deal with it with humour.""
Kalki says this happened when she was in her 30s and that she'd ""already lived enough life to not be affected"".
""But I know that 20-year-olds are being told this and they feel the pressure to go and change their face very early on.""
Kalki says she believes this pressure is worsened by the rise of social media. ""We all scrutinise [ourselves] and we all have these filters."" And in her letter, she shares her fears of trying to protect her daughter from such scrutiny.
She jokes that she even wondered about moving to Australia when she heard of the country's plans to ban smartphones for under-16s. ""That's how my mother-brain is working!""
Kalki is not the only celebrity to speak about the pressure to appear young that is faced by women in the public eye.
Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown made headlines earlier this month for calling out journalists who have criticised the way she has aged.
""The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices is disturbing,"" the 21-year-old said in a three-minute video on her Instagram page.
Dear Daughter podcast is the brainchild of Namulanta Kombo, a mother from Nairobi on a quest to create a ""handbook to life"" for her daughter, through the advice of parents from all over the world.
Each episode has a guest reading a letter they've written to their children, or their future children, or the children they never had, with the advice, life lessons and personal stories they wish to pass on.
In one of the episodes of the current season, Bridgerton actor Adjoa Andoh tells her three children to trust their instincts. In another, wildlife documentary presenter Rae Wynn-Grant offers advice on how to survive self-doubt and encounters with bears.
Dear daughter,
One day after school you told me, ""Maman I'm not pretty."" You were only four. I panicked and immediately responded with, ""What do you mean, of course you're pretty, you're as pretty as a butterfly, as bright as the sun.'' And you continued to say angrily, ""I'm not, I'm just not.""
In retrospect, I wish I had listened to you and been curious enough to ask you why you didn't feel pretty? You see I make mistakes too, my own insecurities and need to protect you took over and I didn't allow you the space to feel what you were feeling. Don't let others decide who you are. Not even me. You have far more experience at being you than anyone else. And no-one else can be a better you than you.
Thankfully, I get second chances at being a better mother, and when a few weeks later you said ""I don't like myself"", I stopped my impulse to tell you what you were and listened. There was some silence and then you opened up about how you were having a hard time with some other children in school.
I thought about how to ensure you know that beauty is not skin deep. The truth is sometimes you will feel ugly. I feel ugly sometimes even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful. And so now I have made it a point to tell you how beautiful you are, not when you're feeling bad about the way you look, and not when you're dressed your best, but when you are being the best versions of you.
As you grow older I know that you will not always believe that you're beautiful because we live in a social world that has distorted beauty, that has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour, or a certain shape. These beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently.
Remember that you are whole and that if you start to pick apart your little nose or your hairy brows or your not quite right ears, you will start to feel ugly, but that is only because you are forgetting the whole. An elephant is a beautiful animal, but pick it apart and it's got a long wrinkly nose, strange side glancing eyes, huge sticking out ears and a big fat stomach.
Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life, they are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs, they are your friends for life.
Dear daughter, do you know when I'll stop loving you? Never.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65p1pv8pdo,Why Elon Musk's Grok is kicking up a storm in India,2025-03-20T22:51:08.988Z,"Soutik Biswas
India correspondent•@soutikBBC","It all started with one question.
A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.
And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.
Instead, it was a simple ask: ""List my 10 best mutuals on X."" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.
When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.
The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.
Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, ""I was just having fun, but lost control."" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.
And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything – cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama – and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an ""unfiltered and unhinged"" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the ""most fun AI in the world!"".
Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.
At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, ""Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!"".
Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.
""Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,"" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.
But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
A tsunami of political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding ""I am not afraid of anyone"". It claimed Gandhi had got the ""edge on formal education than Modi"". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews ""often seemed scripted"".
When an X user asked whether the BJP ""is in trouble"" because of Grok, it replied: ""It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer."" When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.
Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.
""Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,"" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.
""Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,"" he adds.
Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the ""discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown"".
""At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,"" he says.
""Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.
""This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,"" he adds.
When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: ""Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.""
Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.
""In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,"" he said.
India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language and ""controversial responses"", according to reports.
While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that ""people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived"", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.

India correspondent•@soutikBBC","India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.
Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.
Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?
Trump has repeatedly branded India a ""tariff king"" and a ""big abuser"" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.
High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.
The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, already seems to have shifted gears.
Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.
Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)
Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to ""come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence"", according to a statement from his ministry.
India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.
In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.
India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.
Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.
High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.
This has allowed ""cosy incumbents"" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires ""reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism"".
With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.
""We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,"" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said. ""A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.""
In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a ""unique opportunity to shape a new vision"" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.
By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a ""re-globalised"" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.
""By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,"" she adds.
That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.
India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.
""While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,"" says Ms Sengupta.
One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.
According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a ""universal reduction"" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.
However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the ""short run"".
""To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,"" she says.
There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.
Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), believes that India's tendency to soften trade policies ""based on rhetoric rather than economic pressure"" shows a lack of assertiveness in global trade talks.
If this trend continues, he says, India may end up making even more compromises in its trade deal with the US, further ""eroding its bargaining power"".
""In comparison to other major economies, India's pre-emptive surrender on multiple trade fronts - without the US imposing a single country-specific tariff - makes it appear exceptionally vulnerable to pressure tactics.""
The broader consensus seems to be that India should capitalise on what could be the unintended consequences of Trump's tariff wars. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, believes that ""potential US tariffs may have become a catalyst for reforms."".
""If supply chains are rejigged again during the second Trump presidency due to higher tariffs on large exporters, and the world looks for new producers, India may get a second chance,"" she writes.
Creating jobs that manufacture goods for the world won't be easy. India has largely missed the bus on low-end, unskilled factory work - jobs China dominated for decades. Automation is taking over. Without deeper reforms, India risks being left behind.",Asia

BBC News•@Nik_inamdar
Reporting fromKerala","It took Arun George half a working life to scrape together £15,000 ($19,460) in savings, which he used to secure a care worker job for his wife in the UK.
But in barely a few months, he lost it all.
Mr George - not his real name as his wife doesn't want to be identified within their small community for the shame associated with having returned without a job - paid the money in late 2023 to the managers of Alchita Care.
The BBC has seen evidence of the payment to Alchita Care, the private domiciliary care home in Bradford that sponsored his family's visa. He did it at the behest of a local agent in his town in the southern Indian state of Kerala.
It was the promise of a better life for their child who has special needs that prodded the couple to dip into their savings and take such a risk. But when they got to the UK there was no work.
""We kept chasing the care home, but they made up excuses. After I pleaded with them, they forced us to undergo some unpaid training and gave my wife just three days of work,"" Mr George said. ""We couldn't carry on and came back to India a few months later.""
Mr George believes he has been scammed by the company and says the ordeal has set him back at least by a decade financially. His family is just one among hundreds of people from Kerala seeking work in the UK who have been exploited by recruiters, care homes and middlemen.
Most have now given up hope of getting justice or their money.
Alchita Care in Bradford has not responded to the BBC's questions. Their sponsorship licence - which allows care homes to issue certificates of sponsorship to foreign care workers applying for visas - was removed by the Home Office last year.
But at least three other care workers who sent thousands of pounds to Alchita Care and uprooted their lives from Kerala told us that the jobs they had been promised did not materialise.
One of them, still in the UK, said his condition was so precarious that he was surviving on ""bread and milk"" from charity shops for the past few months.
Like Mr George, Sridevi (not her real name) says she was charged £15,000 for a visa sponsorship by Alchita Care. She spent another £3,000 to get to the UK in 2023.
She's unable to return to India, scared of facing family members and friends from whom she took a loan to make the trip.
""I struggle to even pay for my rent and meals,"" she said. Her job is a far cry from the stable eight-hour work she was promised, she says. She is sometimes on call from 4am to 9pm, driving from one patient's home to another, but gets paid only for the few hours she is actually with the patient, and not the full shift.
Thousands of nurses from Kerala, desperate to migrate to the UK every year, are estimated to have been exploited after the government added care workers to the UK's shortage occupation list during Covid. This allowed people to be recruited from overseas as long as they were sponsored.
For many, the care worker visa was a golden ticket to a better life as they could take family along.
Baiju Thittala, a Labour party member and the mayor of Cambridge, told the BBC he had represented at least 10 such victims over the last three years.
But the cross-border nature of these exploitative schemes means it has been incredibly hard to pursue justice, he said. Very often the victims have made payments to care homes or middlemen domiciled outside India which leads to ""jurisdiction problems"", he added.
Secondly, lawyers are expensive and most care workers, already in deep debt, can hardly afford to fight it out in the courts.
Thittala estimates at least 1,000-2,000 people from Kerala, directly or indirectly victims of these schemes, are still in the UK.
There are also hundreds of people scattered across Kerala's towns who lost money before they could even leave home.
In the town of Kothamangalam, the BBC spoke to some 30 people who had collectively lost millions of dollars while trying to obtain a care visa that allows professionals to come to - or stay - in the UK to work in the social care sector.
All of them accused one agent - Henry Poulos and his agency Grace International in the UK and India - of robbing them of their life savings through fake job offers and sponsorship letters.
Mr Poulos even made some of them take a 2,500km journey to Delhi for visa appointments that were non-existent, they said.
Shilpa, who lives in the town of Alleppey, told the BBC she had taken out a bank loan at a 13% interest rate to pay Mr Poulos, who gave her a fake certificate of sponsorship.
""I thought the UK would offer a good future for my three daughters, but now I am struggling to pay their school fees,"" she told the BBC.
""I have lost everything. My wife had left her job in Israel so that we could move to the UK,"" said another victim, Binu, breaking down. He made a comfortable £1,500 with his wife in Israel but has now been forced to take his children out of private school in Kerala because there's no money anymore.
Neither Mr Poulos nor Grace International responded to the BBC, despite repeated attempts to get in touch with them. The police in Kothamangalam said Mr Poulos was absconding in the UK, and they had sealed his local offices after receiving complaints from six people.
The previous Conservative government in the UK admitted last year that there was ""clear evidence"" that care workers were being offered visas under false pretences and paid far below the minimum wage required for their work.
Rules to reduce its misuse were tightened in 2024, including increasing the minimum salary. Care workers are also now restricted from taking dependents, making it a less attractive proposition for families.
Since July 2022, about 450 licences allowing employers to recruit foreign workers have been revoked in the care sector.
Since the beginning of this year, sponsors are now also explicitly prohibited by the Home Office from passing on the cost of the sponsor licence fee or associated administrative costs to prospective employees.
Top police officials in Kerala, meanwhile, told the BBC they were still investigating these cases in India and would work with Interpol agencies to crack down on agents, if necessary.
But for the hundreds who've already been exploited, justice remains elusive, and still very much a distant dream.",Asia

India correspondent•@soutikBBC","Bowlers will be allowed to use saliva to shine the cricket ball in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL), reversing the ban imposed during the Covid pandemic five years ago, reports say.
Indian cricket's governing body's decision came after a majority of the tournament's franchise captains supported the move during a meeting on Thursday, ESPNcricinfo said.
A temporary saliva ban was introduced in May 2020 on medical advice during the pandemic, with use of sweat still permitted. The International Cricket Council (ICC) made the ban permanent in September 2022.
Players use saliva and sweat to polish one side of the ball in order to make it swing in the air.
The use of saliva was banned to reduce potential transmission of the Covid infection.
Saliva helps fast bowlers maintain the ball's shine, creating an imbalance that aids swing, a key element in cricket's bowling mechanics for more than a century.
It also helps bowlers generate reverse swing, where the ball moves in the opposite direction to what is expected. This is particularly important in dry conditions or with older balls.
Saliva is more effective in red-ball cricket, typically used in Tests, than in white-ball formats like ODIs and T20s.
In red-ball cricket, the ball is used for a longer period, allowing bowlers to shine one side and help generate reverse swing.
It remains unclear whether the International Cricket Council (ICC) will lift the saliva ban for red-ball cricket, following the Indian cricket board's decision to lift it for the world's richest T20 league. The ICC is led by Jay Shah, former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the world's wealthiest cricket board.
The change will come into effect from Saturday when IPL 2025 - its 18th edition - kicks off with defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) facing Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) at Eden Gardens. The tournament will feature 74 matches across 13 cities over two months.
Indian fast bowler Mohammed Siraj, who is playing for the Gujarat Titans franchise, has welcomed the decision.
""It's excellent news for us bowlers because when the ball is not doing anything, applying saliva on the ball will increase the chances of finding some reverse swing,"" Siraj told Press Trust of India news agency.
""It sometimes aids reverse swing because scrubbing the ball against the shirt will not help [to get reverse swing]. But using saliva on the ball will help in maintaining [the shine on one side], and it is important.""
Mohammed Shami, another Indian fast bowler, had earlier this month called on the ICC to lift the ban.
After India's Champions Trophy semi-final win over Australia, he said, ""We keep appealing that we should be allowed to use saliva so that we can bring reverse swing back into the game and make it interesting.""
Shami's plea was supported by former international bowlers Vernon Philander and Tim Southee.
Recently, Indian spin great R Ashwin, who recently retired from international cricket, had said that he too was confused by the ban.
""ICC released some research papers which said that saliva did not aid reverse swing much and that not putting saliva on the ball has not made a huge difference. I don't know how they did the research, but saliva should be allowed anyways if it is not a problem,"" he said on his YouTube channel.
Sports writer Sharda Ugra says the lifting of the ban on saliva could help make the contest between bat and ball ""more even"".
Many believe the odds are stacked against the bowlers in T20 leagues with batter-friendly wickets. The highest IPL total, set in 2013 with RCB's 263 for five against Pune, was surpassed four times in 2024. In 17 seasons, there have been 10 totals crossing 250 runs.
However, Ugra adds that it's not clear how much impact the lifting of the ban will have on bowling.
""Saliva isn't the only factor in generating swing - conditions must also be ideal, and a skilled bowler is key,"" she told the BBC.
Some former fast bowlers like India's Venkatesh Prasad also had a word of caution about change.
""The ban on applying saliva was also about maintaining cleanliness. Anything can happen today, we don't know how many - and when - a new virus enters the air. So, I think you need to be very careful in making a decision about lifting the ban,"" Prasad told The Times of India newspaper earlier this month.",Asia

BBC News","The Malaysian cabinet has approved a fresh search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, more than a decade after the aircraft vanished.
The search will cover a 15,000 sq km area in the southern Indian Ocean, under a ""no find, no fee"" agreement with the exploration firm Ocean Infinity.
The company will receive $70m (£56m) if the wreckage is found, transport minister Loke Siew Fook announced.
Flight MH370 disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Its disappearance is one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries, which continues to haunt the families of the passengers.
Despite extensive searches in the years since it vanished, no wreckage has been found. Previous efforts, including a multinational search that cost $150m (£120m), ended in 2017.
The governments of the three nations involved - Malaysia, Australia and China - said the search would only be resumed ""should credible new evidence emerge"" of the aircraft's location.
A 2018 search for the wreckage by Ocean Infinity under similar terms ended unsuccessfully after three months.
In December, Malaysia's government agreed in principle to resume the search. However, the final negotiations were not completed until March.
Malaysia's final approval on Wednesday will now allow the search to begin.
Loke said in a statement: ""The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers.""
Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur in the early hours of 8 March 2014. Less than an hour after takeoff, it lost communication with air traffic control, and radar showed that it had deviated from its planned flight path.
Investigators generally agree that the plane crashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, though the reason for the crash remains unclear.
Pieces of debris, believed to be from the plane, have washed up on the shores of the Indian Ocean in the years following its disappearance.
The aircraft's disappearance has given rise to a host of conspiracy theories, including speculation that the pilot had deliberately brought the plane down and claims that it had been shot down by a foreign military.
An investigation in 2018 into the aircraft's disappearance found that the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course, but drew no conclusions behind it.
Investigators said at the time that ""the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found"".
The passengers included people from more than a dozen countries: just under two-thirds were Chinese nationals, followed by 38 Malaysians, with others from Australia, Indonesia, India, France, Ukraine, the US and several other nations.
Family members of missing Chinese MH370 passengers met with officials in Beijing earlier in March to discuss the renewed search for the wreckage and express their hopes for an independent search. Some relatives voiced their frustration over a lack of direct communication from the Malaysian authorities.
""It was promised that we would be informed immediately [but] we can only find out about this kind of news online,"" said Li Eryou, a 68-year-old father who lost his 29-year-old son.
""Many families don't even know how to access this information, so they are completely unaware,"" he told AFP.
Grieving families gathered outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on the eleventh anniversary of the flight's disappearance earlier this month, chanting: ""Give us back our loved ones!""
Cheng Liping, whose husband had been in Malaysia for a film shoot and had been returning to China on MH370, said she hoped Beijing would communicate more with Malaysia to uncover the truth.
""Everyone has been left trapped in pain,"" she told reporters. ""What exactly happened is still unknown.""
The fresh search prompted mixed reactions from the families of passengers when it was announced in December - with some calling it a step towards closure, while others describing the news as bittersweet.",Asia

BBC Hindi","A court in India has sentenced three men to death for the 1981 murder of 24 people from the Dalit (formerly untouchable) community.
The men were part of a gang of bandits who shot the victims, including women and children, in Dehuli village in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
The special court said on Tuesday that the killings fell into the ""rarest of the rare"" category, which justifies capital punishment in India.
The men, who insist they are innocent, can appeal against the sentence in a higher court.
All the victims were from the Dalit community, which sits at the bottom of India's rigid caste hierarchy.
Relatives of the victims have welcomed the sentence but say the decision should have come earlier.
""Justice came very late to us. The accused have lived their lives,"" said Sanjay Chaudhry, whose cousin was killed in the firing.
Thirteen of the 17 men accused in the case have died in the 44 years since the crime was committed. Apart from the three men who have been sentenced to death, there is one more accused, who is absconding.
The crime took place on 18 November 1981, when 17 men - most of them from the upper caste - wearing police uniforms stormed Dehuli and started shooting at villagers.
According to the police complaint registered at the time, the violence followed the murder of a Dalit member of the robbers' gang by his upper-caste colleagues. The gang members then attacked the village because they suspected that some Dalit villagers were providing information to the police in the murder case.
The survivors of the massacre have vivid memories of the day.
""I was doing household chores when suddenly the firing started,"" says Rakesh Kumar, a witness who was a teenager at the time.
""I was hiding behind a stack of paddy and when I came out, I saw that many people, including my mother, were shot,"" he said.
Mr Kumar's mother Chameli Devi, now 80, was hit by a bullet in her leg while running from the gunfire.
""They did not spare anyone, including women or children,"" she said. ""Whoever they found was killed.""
The firing lasted for more than four hours and the attackers fled the scene before the police arrived, according to media reports.
The crime led to an exodus of Dalits from Dehuli, and the local administration sent police personnel to the village, where they stayed for months in a bid to reassure people. It also triggered a political uproar, and then prime minister Indira Gandhi had visited Dehuli to meet the victims.
In 1984, the case was transferred from a district court to the Allahabad Sessions Court on the orders of the state's high court. The trial continued there on and off until 2024, when the case was shifted to the special court in Mainpuri which found the men guilty.
It's not unusual for courts in India to take decades to finish hearing a case and deliver a verdict, especially when the victims are from disadvantaged communities. In 2023, a 90-year-old man was sentenced for life in prison for a caste crime that also took place in 1981.

BBC News, Delhi","A curfew has been imposed in parts of a city in India's western state of Maharashtra after Hindu groups demanded the removal of the tomb of Aurangzeb, a 17th-Century Mughal emperor, sparking violence on Monday night.
Vehicles were set on fire and stones were thrown in the Mahal area of Nagpur city.
Police say the situation is now under control and are appealing to people to keep the peace.
The tomb of Aurangzeb, who died more than 300 years ago, has in recent years become a political flashpoint amid growing calls for its removal by hardline Hindu groups.
It is located about 500km (311 miles) from Nagpur in the state's Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, which was earlier called Aurangabad after the emperor.
Monday's violence broke out after two Hindu organisations, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal, burnt the emperor's effigy and chanted slogans demanding the removal of his tomb, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told the state assembly.
This sparked rumours that some religious symbols had been desecrated. Fadnavis said this led to violence that looked like ""a well-planned attack"".
He said after evening prayers, a crowd of 250 Muslim men gathered and started shouting slogans. ""When people started saying they would set vehicles on fire, police used force,"" he added.
More than 50 people have been detained and 33 policemen were injured in the incident, Nagpur police commissioner Ravinder Singal told ANI news agency.
Shops and businesses in the central areas of Nagpur remain closed and security has been tightened across the city.
Meanwhile, opposition parties have criticised the state's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government saying ""law and order in the state has collapsed"".
The trigger for this week's violence has been a recent Bollywood film about Sambhaji – a Maratha ruler who clashed with Aurangzeb but lost – and its graphic depiction of him being tortured.
The movie has ""ignited people's anger against Aurangzeb"", Fadnavis told the state assembly on Tuesday.
The issue has been making headlines in the state for days with politicians from Hindu nationalist parties criticising Aurangzeb and calling for his tomb to be removed.
The protesters were also angered earlier this month when Abu Azmi, a regional politician, said that Aurangzeb was not a ""cruel administrator"" and had ""built many temples"".
Azmi also said the emperor's reign saw India's borders reaching Afghanistan and present-day Myanmar, and the country was referred to as a golden bird, with its gross domestic product accounting for a quarter of the world's GDP.
He later told a court his remarks were misinterpreted, but he was suspended from Maharashtra's state assembly and an investigation was ordered against him.
In 2022, Aurangzeb's name was trending on social media when the dispute over a mosque - built on the ruins of the Vishwanath temple, a grand 17th-Century Hindu shrine destroyed on Aurangzeb's orders - broke out as a court ordered a survey to ascertain if the mosque had been built over what was originally a Hindu temple.
His tomb was shut for visitors after a regional politician questioned ""the need for its existence"" and called for its destruction.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about ""Aurangzeb's atrocities and ""his terror"" at an event in Varanasi that year. ""He tried to change civilisation by the sword. He tried to crush culture with fanaticism,"" Modi said.
Aurangzeb was the sixth emperor of the Mughal kingdom who ruled India for nearly five decades from 1658 to 1707.
He is often described as a devout Muslim who lived the life of an ascetic, but was ruthless in his pursuit of expanding the empire, imposing strict sharia laws and discriminatory taxes.
He was accused of razing Hindu temples, though some critics point out he also built a few.

BBC News","A portable power bank likely caused a fire that engulfed and destroyed a passenger plane in South Korea in January, according to local authorities.
The Air Busan plane caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in the country's south on 28 January – causing three people on board to sustain minor injuries.
On Friday, South Korea's transport ministry said that interim investigation results indicate the fire may have started because insulation inside a power bank battery had broken down.
The power bank was found in an overhead luggage compartment where the fire was first detected, and its debris had scorch marks, according to the statement.
Investigators could not say what may have caused the battery breakdown, it added.
The update is also based only on interim findings, and is not a final accident report on the aircraft, an Airbus A321ceo.
Airlines around the world have banned power banks from checked luggage for years due to safety concerns, which relate to the lithium-ion batteries inside the devices.
These batteries can produce extreme heat and fire if damage or manufacturing faults cause them to short circuit.
Lithium-ion batteries of any kind have been banned from the cargo holds of passenger planes since 2016, as per a directive by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
In the week after the Air Busan fire, the airline tightened those rules further, announcing that it would no longer allow passengers to keep power banks in their onboard luggage.
The carrier said the new rules were in response to an increase in the number of power banks that were overheating.
A growing number of airlines – including China Airlines and Thai Airways - are rolling out similar rules, with Singapore Airlines and its low-cost unit Scoot set to become the latest to ban the use and charging of power banks onboard from 1 April.
On 28 February, the South Korean government also announced that passengers boarding flights in the country would be required to carry portable batteries and chargers on their person, rather than storing them in overhead compartments.",Asia

BBC News","Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing
An eight-year-old child who was raped in Bangladesh died of her injuries on Thursday, setting off fierce protests around the country.
The girl was raped while visiting her elder sister's house in the city of Magura some time between the night of 5 March and the following morning, according to a case filed by her mother.
The elder sister's 18-year-old husband, along with his parents and brother, were arrested and placed on remand.
On Thursday night, after hearing news of the child's death, an angry mob descended on the house where the incident is alleged to have taken place, setting it on fire.
The girl died at about 13:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Thursday after suffering three cardiac arrests, according to a statement by the government's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) department.
""Although doctors managed to stabilize the condition twice, the heart failed to restart after the third episode,"" the statement said.
She had spent six days in a critical condition at the Combined Military Hospital in the capital Dhaka, after being admitted on 8 March.
""I thought my daughter would survive,"" her mother said following the girl's death, according to local media. ""If she had made it through, I would never have let her go anywhere alone again.""
The girl's body was taken back to Magura in an army helicopter, which landed at the local stadium around 18:00 to fierce protests.
Aiyub Ali, officer-in-charge of Magura Sadar Police Station, said that authorities struggled to bring the situation under control, according to local news outlet The Daily Star.
Thousands of people gathered in the public square in Magura for the girl's namaz-e-janaza, the Islamic funeral prayer, before she was laid to rest at 19:30.
An absentee funeral was also held for the girl at Dhaka University, in the nation's capital, followed by a protest march and speeches by female students.
Many protesters demanded that the government expedite justice for rape victims and reform laws related to women and children's safety.
Protesters also called for greater clarity around the legal definitions of what constitutes rape in Bangladesh, which they said were currently ambiguous.
The trial of the rape and murder case is expected to begin within the next seven days, according to legal advisor Asif Nazrul.
""DNA sample collection has been completed, we hope to get the report within the next five days,"" Mr Nazrul told a press briefing at the Secretariat on Thursday – adding that statements had already been taken from 12 to 13 people.
""If we can start the trial within seven days, our judges will be able to ensure justice with the utmost speed,"" he added.
The rape of minors is punishable by death in Bangladesh, as per a law that was passed in 2020.
The introduction of that law followed a series of high-profile sexual violence cases, including the brutal gang assault on a 37-year-old woman that was filmed and spread on social media.
Less than a week after the rape of the young girl in Magura, media reports emerged of at least three rapes of children of around the same age in different parts of Bangladesh.
In some cases the accused were neighbours of the victim, while others were close relatives.
According to statistics from the Law and Arbitration Center, 3,438 child rape cases have been filed in Bangladesh in the last eight years, and there have been many more rape victims.
At least 539 of them are under the age of six, and 933 are between the ages of seven and twelve.
Research has shown that in most cases, children are sexually abused or raped by people they know.",Asia

BBC News","In some of his strongest rhetoric yet amid worsening cross-strait ties, Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te has labelled China a ""foreign hostile force"".
He said Taiwan had ""no choice but to take even more proactive measures"" as a result, as he announced a raft of new national security measures, including reinstating a military court system and tightening the residency criteria for those from China, Hong Kong and Macau.
In response to Lai's remarks, Chinese authorities called him a ""destroyer of cross-straits peace"" and a ""creator of crisis"".
China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.
China was quick to respond to Lai's statement, with China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Chen Binhua said China would have ""no choice but to take decisive measures... [if] 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces dare to cross the red line"".
""Those who play with fire will surely be burned.""
This is not the first time Lai, whose Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is seen as pro-independence, has incurred Beijing's wrath. He was previously labelled a ""troublemaker"" ahead of the polls, and Chinese state media even suggested he should be prosecuted for secession.
Speaking to reporters after a high-level national security meeting on Thursday, Lai also warned of China's growing espionage efforts.
President Lai said China had ""taken advantage of Taiwan's freedom"" to recruit different members of society, including current and former armed force members, organised crime groups and the media to ""divide, destroy and subvert us from within"".
Taiwanese authorities charged 64 people with spying for China last year - a three-fold increase from 2021 - Lai claimed, adding that the majority of them were current or former military officials.
To counter China's attempts to infiltrate and spy on the military, Lai said he planned to restore the military court system to ""allow military judges to return to the frontline... to handle criminal cases involving active-duty military personnel"".
Taiwan had in 2013 abolished the military court system after it came under fire for its opaque handling of the death of an army conscript.
Lai also called on authorities to ""provide entertainers with guidelines on conduct while working in China"", adding that this would prevent China from pressuring stars to behave in ways that ""endanger national dignity"".
His comments come as Taiwanese authorities earlier criticised Taiwanese celebrities who shared social media posts calling for Taiwan to be ""returned"" to China.
Taiwanese actors and singers looking to advance their careers in China's lucrative entertainment industry have come also under increasing pressure to publicly adopt a pro-Beijing stance on the issue.",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrxez45dr1o,USAID kept them alive - then Trump's cuts came,2025-03-14T00:34:35.536Z,"Samira Hussain
BBC South Asia Correspondent","When Kajol contracted tuberculosis in January, USAID kept her alive. Now she and her family are in danger again after the Trump administration ordered most US aid spending to end.
TB can be fatal if left untreated. The highly contagious bacterial disease, which usually infects the lungs, is not prevalent in rich countries, because treatment is relatively cheap. But in Bangladesh, it is a scourge.
That's especially so in neighbourhoods such as Mohammadpur, a slum in the capital Dhaka where Kajol,17, lives.
""We are poor people,"" she says. She is the sole breadwinner for herself, her mother and little brother. Her job in a garment factory keeps them all afloat.
So when she fell ill in January, it could have been catastrophic.
Instead, help arrived through Dipa Halder. For the last three years, she has been canvassing the residents of Mohammadpur about TB and getting people the treatment they so desperately need, free of cost.
The initiative, which gets people tested and get them treatment they need including proper nutrition, is run by a local aid organisation, Nari Maitree. It was funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID) until February, when it received a letter from the US government saying the funds had been terminated.
That brought Kajol's treatment, only partially completed, to an abrupt end.
Cutting off medicines mid-treatment makes the chances of TB becoming drug-resistant much greater. It makes the disease much more difficult to combat and puts patients at greater risk of severe illness and death.
The government provides free medication but getting diagnosed and collecting the medicines can be cost prohibitive for many.
""Now I have to go get the medicine myself,"" she says. ""I am struggling a lot.""
""The people here are quite vulnerable,"" says Dipa, 21. ""I can tell them to go to a particular doctor, which would help them save some money.
""Or I try to provide them with some financial assistance from our organisation so that they can continue their treatment.""
According to a US government performance report seen by the BBC, support by USAID in 2023 resulted directly in the identification and reporting of more than a quarter of a million new cases of TB in Bangladesh. In the same year, there were 296,487 new or relapse cases of TB which were cured or successfully completed as a result of USAID.
The agency was seen as integral to the country's fight against tuberculosis.
""You ask people on the street, they will say yeah, it's the US, they are the ones that are keeping it [tuberculosis] in control,"" said a director of a USAID project in Bangladesh, who is not authorised to speak publicly and did not want to be named.
""Bangladesh was USAID's largest programme in Asia,"" says Asif Saleh, executive director of the non-profit BRAC organisation. ""In terms of its impact, particularly in the healthcare sector, it has been massive.
""Particularly around vaccination, reducing child mortality and maternal mortality, USAID has played a massive role in this country.""
In 2024, Bangladesh received $500m in foreign assistance. This year, that amount has cratered to $71m. To put that number into context, in the three-year period from 2021-2023, USAID committed an average of $83m annually in Bangladesh for health initiatives alone, including combating TB.
Cuts to USAID have meant Nari Maitree can no longer offer its Stop TB Program, but it also means Dipa is out of work. She supports her elderly parents and her younger sister.
""I am completely shattered now that I lost my job. I am carrying the burden of the family. Being unemployed is a devastating situation,"" she told the BBC.
In a document seen by the BBC, 113 programmes that were funded directly by the USAID office in Bangladesh have stopped. The list does not include the myriad programmes that are funded directly by US agencies in Washington.
""The NGO sector [In Bangladesh] employs 500,000 people at least,"" says Mr Saleh. ""It's huge. Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be eliminated.""
It's not just the United States that is moving away from foreign aid. The UK has announced cuts to its foreign assistance programmes, as has Switzerland. It is likely that other countries may follow suit.
It's a sobering reality for Bangladesh. The country's government was overthrown last year and the economy is shaky, with inflation near 10% and a jobs crisis, particularly among young people.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus says Bangladesh will come up with a new strategy on how to survive following the aid cuts – but doesn't say how.
When pressed in a BBC interview on how the country will cover the shortfall from USAID, Yunus said: ""It was a small part, not a big deal. It doesn't mean Bangladesh will disappear from the map.""
Asif Saleh says the way the cuts have been implemented has been abrupt and chaotic. The impact on a country like Bangladesh is immeasurable.
Nowhere is that more clear than in Cox's Bazar, a coastal city in south-eastern Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp. More than one million Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority community that the United Nations calls victims of ethnic cleansing, fled violent purges in their home country, neighbouring Myanmar.
Unable to go back home and unable to work outside the refugee camp, the Rohingya depend on international aid for their survival.
The United States contributed almost half of all aid to Rohingya refugees.
""We have run out of soap,"" says Rana Flowers, country representative for the UN children's agency Unicef. ""We are now having to truck water into the camps. It's an absolutely critical time. There is an outbreak of cholera with over 580 cases, along with a scabies outbreak.""
Water sanitation projects in the camps used to be funded by USAID.
Since the order to stop work went into effect at the end of January, hospitals such as the International Red Cross hospital in Cox's Bazar are reduced to providing emergency assistance only. Any hope the money would be reinstated was crushed this week, when the Trump administration cancelled more than 80% of all the programmes at USAID.
Patients like Hamida Begum, who was getting regular treatment for hypertension, are left with few options.
""I'm old and I don't have anyone to help me,"" she says. Her husband died last year, leaving her to care for her four children alone, including her 12-year-old daughter who cannot walk.
""I cannot go to another hospital far from home because of my daughter.""
At a nearby UN food distribution centre, Rehana Begum is standing beside two large sacks.
Inside, she says, are six litres of cooking oil and 13kg of rice, along with basics such as onions, garlic and dried chillies. These rations, given to her by the World Food Programme (WFP), need to last her and her family a month.
I ask how she will manage now that her rations will be cut in half beginning next month.
She looked shocked. Then she started to cry.
""How can we possibly survive with such a small amount?"" asks Rehana, 47, who shares one room with her husband and five children. ""Even now, it is difficult to manage.""
The WFP says it was forced to make the drastic cut because of ""a critical funding shortfall for its emergency response operations"".
The rations now being allotted to the Rohingya community will only meet their basic daily dietary needs, igniting fears they will be left with just enough to live and not much more.
""This is an absolute disaster in the making,"" says Rana Flowers of Unicef. ""Desperate frustrated people within the camps will lead to security concerns. If that escalates to the degree it could, we won't be able to go into the camps to help.""",Asia

Reporting fromQuetta
Gavin Butler
BBC News
Reporting fromSingapore","Mehboob Hussain was riding the train home on Tuesday when the tracks under the front car exploded.
In the depths of central Pakistan's Bolan Pass, a pocket of wilderness so remote that there is no internet or mobile network coverage, the nine-coach Jaffar Express ground to a halt. Then the bullets started flying.
""I was a passenger on the train that was attacked,"" Mr Hussain told BBC Urdu.
He, along with some 440 others, had been travelling from Quetta to Peshawar through the heart of the restive Balochistan province when a group of armed militants struck – they bombed the tracks, fired on the train and then stormed the carriages.
The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) quickly claimed responsibility for the siege, and threatened to kill many of those on board if Pakistani authorities did not release Baloch political prisoners within 48 hours.
The group, which many countries have designated a terrorist organisation, has waged a decades-long insurgency to gain independence for Balochistan, accusing Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich mineral resources while also neglecting it.
BLA militants have a long history of attacking military camps, railway stations and trains in the region.
But this was the first time they had hijacked one.
The siege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 300 passengers have now been freed, and 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.
Information relating to the attack and the subsequent rescue operation has been tightly controlled throughout.
But the BBC was able to speak to multiple eyewitnesseses who described the ""doomsday scenes"" on board the train as the attack unfolded.
As Ishaq Noor told BBC Urdu of those first few moments: ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next.""
A railway police officer who was on board the train told BBC Urdu that, contrary to initial reports from Pakistani authorities, the train was ""not in a tunnel but in an open area"" when it was hit.
The BLA has also released an alleged video of the moment the train was struck by the blast. It shows an open section of track that runs along the base of a large rocky slope.
Atop that slope, according to the video, is a cluster of BLA fighters.
The officer described to the BBC how he initially ""fought together with other police officers"" to try and hold off the militants until ""the ammunition ran out"".
""They [the BLA] were moving in front of us on the mountain and they were much more numerous than us, in the hundreds,"" the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recalled. He noted that he was accompanied by four railway police and two members of Pakistan's paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC).
At least 100 of those on the train were members of the security forces, according to Pakistani officials.
""I told my companion to give me the G-3 rifle because it is a better weapon,"" the officer explained. ""When I got the rifle and the rounds, we also started firing back. I used to fire one shot at a time at them so that they could not come near us and the train... [But] in an hour-and-half, our rounds were over... We were helpless.""
When the gunfire from those on board the Jaffar Express ceased, the militants came down from the surrounding mountains and started taking passengers off the train, the officer said.
""They started checking cards and telling people to go this way, this way,"" he said, explaining that the hostages were separated into groups alongside the train, according to their ethnicity.
The militants were speaking in the Balochi language, he added, and declared, ""We have made demands to the government and if they are not met, we will not spare anyone; we will set the vehicle on fire"".
The officer claimed the militants were receiving orders: ""They would get orders to kill, and they would pick up people from the group and kill them. They killed many people - both army personnel and civilians.""
Some passengers, however, were allowed to leave unharmed – including women, children, the elderly and those who lived in Balochistan, according to Mr Noor.
Among those released was Noor Muhammad. He said that when the initial volleys of gunfire stopped after an hour, armed men forced open the door to the train and entered, saying ""get out or we will shoot you"".
Mr Muhammad said he was escorted off the train, and when he told the militants his wife was still in the back of the car, they brought her out too. Then they ""told us to go straight and not look back"".
The couple walked through the wilderness, he said, and with ""great difficulty"" reached Panir Railway Station at about 1900, where they rested.
His wife recalled the moment the Pakistan military arrived to meet them.
""They told me, 'ma'am, come inside with us, we will take you home safely,'"" she said. The soldiers took the couple to the town of Machh, she added, ""and then we reached Quetta to our children, who were waiting for us"".
Some passengers who managed to leave the train late on Tuesday evening said they walked for nearly four hours to reach the next railway station. They included Muhammad Ashraf, who had been riding the train to Lahore to visit his family.
""We reached the station with great difficulty,"" he told BBC Urdu, ""because we were tired and there were children and women with us.""
As night descended over the Jaffar Express, scores of BLA militants began to depart, according to the police official who did not wish to named.
""Many of them hugged each other and 70, 80 people left while 20, 25 stayed behind,"" he said.
At about 10pm, he recalled, violence erupted again.
""Some people tried to run away, they [the BLA] saw them and opened fire, then everyone fell to the ground,"" the official said.
Mr Mehboob similarly recalled gunfire throughout the night – and said that at one point, a person close to him, who had five daughters, was shot.
""When someone is killed in front of your eyes, you don't know what to do,"" he said.
Another passenger, Allahditta, said his cousin was killed in front of him by the BLA. He said his cousin was pleading to the militants to not kill him as he had young daughters but ""his life was not spared"".
The BBC on Wednesday saw dozens of wooden coffins being loaded at Quetta railway station. A railway official said they were empty and being transported to collect casualties.
It was during the time of morning prayer on Wednesday that rescuers from the FC started firing on the BLA militants, Mr Allahditta said.
Amid the sudden chaos, he and others broke free.
""When the FC opened fire at the time of the Fajr call to prayer, we escaped from the militants,"" Mr Allahdita said.
The police official similarly recalled the moment when the FC moved in, briefly diverting the BLA militants' focus away from the hostages.
""When the FC arrived in the morning, the attention of these people turned to this direction,"" the official said. ""I told my companion, 'Let's try to run away.'""
Militants fired on the escapees as they fled, and the official said his companion was hit from behind.
""He told me to let go of him. I said no, I'll carry you on my shoulder. Then another person also joined hands and we went down the hills and out of firing range.""
Mr Mehboob, Mr Allahdita, the police official and his companion all managed to escape the Jaffar Express alive as the FC attacked the militants.
Military and paramilitary troops and helicopters had surrounded the stranded train since Tuesday. On Wednesday, they killed the hostage-takers and cleared the site, according to a military spokesperson.
Authorities said there were 440 passengers on the train - and 300 of them have been freed. But it's still unclear what happened to the remaining 140. Reuters and AFP quoted an unnamed security official who said some miliants had left, taking an unknown number of passengers with them.
The military says it is still working to find passengers who escaped and fled into the surrounding area, and insists that any others involved in the hijacking would be brought to justice.
Mr Noor, who is now distributing alms and charity in his hometown along with his wife, is just grateful to have escaped the situation with his life.
""Thank God,"" Mr Noor said. ""He saved us.""",Asia

Thiruvananthapuram","Thousands of frontline healthcare workers in southern India's Kerala state, who have been holding demonstrations for the past month seeking better pay and recognition, have vowed to continue their protest.
Kerala's 26,225 female workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists or Ashas (Hindi for hope), have been holding protests near the state government headquarters in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram.
The protesters, who provide crucial medical support in the country's rural areas, say they plan to ""lay siege"" to the state secretariat in the coming week, if authorities continue to ignore their demands.
The Ashas, who number more than a million across the country, are fighting for better salaries and for official ""worker"" status.
The women are currently categorised as volunteers, which means they are not guaranteed any benefits from the government, despite playing a crucial role in delivering healthcare in rural and underserved areas.
On Monday, Shashi Tharoor, an MP from Kerala, said the Asha volunteers were ""unsung heroes"" of India's healthcare system and the ""protests highlight the systemic undervaluation of community health workers in India and in particular in Kerala"".
India's federal health minister recently told parliament that the government would raise incentives for the workers. Authorities in Kerala, meanwhile, have released three months of pending payments.
The state's health minister also said Kerala would request the federal government to recognise these women as regular workers and not volunteers.
The state government, however, has insisted that the money it offers to the Ashas is the highest in the country.
But the protesters said state authorities had not engaged in talks with them and accused them of instead employing tactics to suppress their protest.
This week, police removed the plastic tarpaulin sheet the protesters had tied overhead at the site of their sit-in demonstration, exposing them to direct sun.
The Ashas - who get an honorarium of 7,000 rupees and not a salary because they are volunteers and not workers - say they want the payment to be increased to 21,000 rupees ($240.8; £186.2) and retirement benefits.
The state's Health Minister Veena George, however, says that 90% of the Ashas earn between 10,000-13,500 rupees per month, including incentives.
""They are entitled to maternity leave, and measures are taken to prevent excessive workload,"" she said.
But some of the protesting women counter these claims.
Kuzhipparamba Thankamony, one of the protesters, said she received only 6,300 rupees as honorarium in October 2024.
""They deducted 700 rupees for a meeting I missed because I was sick and had to go to hospital.""
When the 45-year-old joined the Ashas 17 years ago, she worked only for an hour or two a day, she said.
""Now I am so burdened with work that a whole day does not suffice,"" she told the BBC.
""This is a matter of social justice,"" Saboora Arifa, one of the Asha protest co-ordinators told the BBC. ""Those who work eight hours a day are not volunteers. We have every right to get worker status.""
In a country where millions of Indians, especially in the remote areas, do not have access to quality healthcare, the Asha workers have played a vital role over the years.
Their job involves going door-to-door to raise awareness about nutrition, sanitation, immunisation and providing neonatal and antenatal care, among other things.
They played a crucial role during the Covid pandemic, especially in Kerala which was first to report a Covid case, and have been credited for successfully containing outbreaks of Zika and Nipah viruses.
Dr Joe Thomas, a Melbourne-based public health policy analyst, believes India should change its perception of these community health workers whose contribution to primary health is universally recognised.
These workers are doing the job of midwives in Kerala after the state's health authorities froze recruitment of midwives, he told the BBC. ""The maternity care support has slowly been shifted to Ashas.""
According to him, 90% of the women in Kerala get prenatal care like testing, nutrition supplements and advice from Asha volunteers.
""Kerala takes pride in achieving 99% vaccination,"" says Dr Thomas. ""The credit for its vaccination success goes to the Ashas. Their contribution to primary health in Kerala is that they are the only people working on prevention.""
The protest in Kerala is only the latest in a series of protests by these community health workers across India.
Earlier this year, neighbouring Karnataka state increased its honorarium amount to 10,000 rupees after Asha volunteers went on strike.
And last year, volunteers in Andhra Pradesh held several state-wide protests. This month, the state became the first in the country to give its workers a gratuity of 150,000 rupees ($1,723; 1,330), along with paid maternity leave of 180 days, and raised retirement age from 60 to 62.",Asia

BBC News","China's biggest hotpot chain Haidilao has offered to compensate more than 4,000 diners who visited one of its Shanghai branches, where two teens urinated into their hotpot broth.
A video of the boys peeing into their broth pot while dining in a private room was widely shared online last month. It is not clear who might have filmed the incident.
Police said the 17-year-olds, who were drunk at the time, were detained soon after the incident.
There is no suggestion anyone consumed the affected broth. Haidilao has apologised to customers, saying it has replaced all hotpot equipment and dining utensils, as well as disinfecting other crockery and utensils.
The incident happened late in February, though the company's management only found out about it days later, after videos circulated on social media.
Haidilao said the staff on duty at the time had failed to stop the teens.
It took another week to find out which outlet it was, the company said, as it has dozens of outlets in the city.
Diners in Haidilao use their own personal hotpot equipment to cook their food, and broths are not re-used again for other customers. However, it is unclear in this case if the hotpot in question was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before it was used by the next customer.
""We fully understand that the distress caused to our customers by this incident cannot be fully compensated for by any means, but we will do our utmost to take responsibility,"" the company said in a statement.
Haidilao said customers who dined at the outlet between 24 February and 8 March will receive a full refund, followed by cash compensation that is 10 times the amount they were billed.
The company has expanded quickly since it opened its first restaurant in Jianyang in Sichuan province. It now operates more than 1,000 restaurants across the world.
Haidilao is known for its customer service and family-friendly atmosphere, where ladies can receive manicures and kids are treated to candy floss while waiting for a table.",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw1nklxezo,Duterte's first night in ICC custody is a pivotal moment for the court,2025-03-13T06:39:02.107Z,"Anna Holligan
Reporting fromThe Hague","Outside the International Criminal Court's (ICC) detention centre, where former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has been taken, his supporters gathered on Wednesday night, waving national flags and shouting, ""Bring him back!"" as a vehicle thought to be carrying him was driven through the imposing iron gates at speed.
Shortly before he landed in the Netherlands, the 79-year-old unapologetically defended his bloody ""war on drugs"" for which the ICC says there are ""reasonable grounds"" to charge him with murder as a crime against humanity.
Small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial on his watch as mayor and, later, as president.
The official toll stands at 6,000, though activists believe the real figure could run into the tens of thousands.
Duterte said he cracked down on drug dealers to rid the country of street crimes.
However, rights groups allege that the campaign was rife with police abuse, targeting young men from the urban poor.
Duterte is the first Asian former head of state to be indicted by the ICC - and the first suspect to be flown to The Hague in three years.
And his arrival comes at a pivotal moment for the International Criminal Court.
Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and deportation on Monday was the result of an unprecedented chain of events.
His supporters allege that the ICC is being used as a political tool by the country's current president Ferdinand Marcos who has publicly fallen out with the powerful Duterte family.
The ICC is a court of last resort designed to hold the most powerful to account when domestic courts are unable or unwilling to do so. But this case is a reminder of the extent to which it depends on state co-operation in order to fulfil its mandate - it effectively has no power to arrest people without the co-operation of the countries they are in, which is most often refused.
In the case of Duterte, chances that he would ever be prosecuted by the ICC seemed unthinkable even in 2022, when his daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, allied with Marcos to create the powerful ""uniteam"" that swept presidential elections.
Up until a few months ago, Marcos had dismissed the idea of co-operating with the ICC.
But the pace at which Duterte was served an arrest warrant and extradited shows that when political winds shift, those once considered untouchable can find themselves touching down in The Hague.
The whole process of his extradition - from his detention in Manila to his arrival in The Hague - has been documented on social media by his daughter Kitty and Duterte himself through his aide. His plane was the most tracked on flight radar.
""I am the one who led our law enforcement and military. I said that I will protect you and I will be responsible for all of this,"" he said on a Facebook video, one of many that was shared over more than 24 hours during his journey from Manila to The Hague.
It provided rare insight into what is usually an opaque process, and the world was able to follow, sometimes in real time, every step of it right down to the meals Duterte was served on board his chartered jet.
Duterte's arrest now sends a strong signal that even powerful individuals may be held accountable for their actions, potentially deterring future abuses.
His case has also reignited debate about the ICC's role in relation to national sovereignty, a concern often raised by non-member states like the United States, Russia, and China.
The court depends on its 128 members to fund and be the operational arm of this judicial body.
So Duterte's headline-making arrival, followed by his first night in custody at The Hague, offer the court a much-needed win.
After serving two high-profile arrest warrants – one for the Russian president Vladimir Putin, and another for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the war in Gaza – which are unlikely to be enforced, the arrival of Duterte will be put forth as proof the court is capable of bringing those accused of the gravest atrocities to face justice.
It is a litmus test for the ICC's ability to function effectively in an increasingly polarised climate.
ICC prosecutor Karim Khan was recently sanctioned by Donald Trump over the arrest warrant issued for Benjamin Netanyahu.
The detention of Duterte provides him with a powerful response.
""Many say international law is not strong,"" Karim Khan acknowledged. ""But international law is not as weak as some may think. When we come together, when we build partnerships, the rule of law can prevail.""
The former Philippines president will now mark his 80th birthday this month in the ICC's detention facility, located in the dunes of The Hague.
The facility, once a Nazi prison complex, provides each detainee with a private cell, access to computers, a library, and sports facilities.
If he isn't satisfied with the meals provided, Duterte has the option to prepare his own food using a shopping list in the detention center's kitchen. He will also have access to medical care, lawyers, and visitors.
He is expected to make his initial court appearance in the coming days, where he will confirm his identity, choose the language he wishes to follow proceedings in, and acknowledge the charges against him.

BBC News","A Taiwanese actor who was earlier arrested for allegedly dodging mandatory military duties has now begun his conscription service.
Darren Wang, who shot to fame for his breakout role in the 2015 teen rom-com Our Times, allegedly used forged medical documents to try to get a military service exemption, according to local news outlets.
All men in Taiwan have to undergo compulsory military service for one year. The government raised this from four months in 2022, citing growing threats from mainland China.
Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, but China sees the self-ruled island as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control.
News of the 33-year-old Wang's alleged military evasion had earlier sparked debate on Chinese social media with some Taiwanese netizens accusing him of evading his duties, and others asking him to ""become a citizen [of the People's Republic of China]"".
Wang is popular in the Chinese mainland, and has previously referred to it as the ""motherland"".
Wang was arrested at his home on 18 February and taken for questioning by police before being released on bail.
Local news reports said he was under investigation for the alleged forgery of a medical document, with Taiwan's Central News Agency saying that ""relevant evidence"" had been seized from his home.
He was released on bail, but was later investigated again for his suspected involvement in an attempted murder case after police reportedly discovered incriminating messages on his phone.
Wang was taken into custody again in March for this, and was later released on bail.
He is still under investigation for both charges.
On Thursday, Wang joined more than 1,000 other recruits at the Chenggong Ling military camp in Taichung city.
They will undergo weeks of basic training before being transferred to a specialised unit.
All men over the age of 18 in Taiwan are required to serve in the army - though deferments can be granted in certain cases. However, all men are required to serve in the military by the time they turn 36.
In the 1990s, men were required to serve in the military for up to three years, this was over the next few decades gradually shortened, before being reduced to four months.
However, then president Tsai Ing-wen had in 2022 said this would be extended to a year amid growing tensions with China.
Taiwan is on the frontline of authoritarian expansion,"" she had then said, adding that conscripts will also undergo more intense training, borrowing some elements from the US and other advanced militaries.",Asia

BBC News","A plane carrying former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has arrived in the Netherlands where he is to face charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court (ICC) over his deadly ""war on drugs"".
Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on Tuesday and within hours was on a chartered jet which flew via Dubai to The Hague, where the ICC sits.
The 79-year-old could become the first Asian former head of state to go on trial at the ICC.
Duterte, who contested his extradition, led the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and presided over a violent ""war on drugs"" that saw thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others killed without trial.
The Gulfstream G550 landed in Dubai for a stopover early on Wednesday and its expected departure was delayed for several hours while Duterte received medical checks, Reuters news agency reports.
Once the plane had landed in Rotterdam, the ICC confirmed that Duterte was in its custody to face charges ""of murder as a crime against humanity"".
""A hearing will be scheduled in due course for Mr Duterte's initial appearance before the Court.""
Meanwhile the former leaders' supporters gathered outside The Hague Penitentiary Institution protesting his arrest. Many of them waved the Philippine flag, while others mimicked Duterte's signature fist-pumping gesture.
""We stand with Duterte,"" read a banner held up by supporters.
Duterte's main political rival, current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, was instrumental in handing him over. Minutes after Duterte left Philippines airspace, Marcos gave a televised address saying the country was fulfilling its legal obligation.
""This is what the international community expects of us,"" Marcos said.
The Duterte and Marcos families are the Philippines' most powerful political dynasties. They joined forces to sweep the country's last national election in 2022, but have fallen out in recent months as they pursued separate agendas.
Duterte being handed to the ICC is the latest twist in a political feud that has unfolded spectacularly in the public view.
The Duterte and Marcos families formed a formidable alliance in the 2022 elections. Against the elder Duterte's wishes, his daughter Sara ran as Marcos Jr's vice-president instead of seeking her father's post.
Marcos initially refused to co-operate with the ICC investigation, but as his relationship with the Duterte family deteriorated, he changed his stance.
Vice-President Duterte said her father's arrest amounted to ""kidnapping"", claiming it violated Philippine sovereignty. She left Manila for the Netherlands on Wednesday, according to her office.
Rodrigo Duterte previously insisted that the ICC has no jurisdiction over the Philippines, since he pulled the country out of the tribunal in 2019, three years after it took note of the drug war's rising death toll.
But according to the Rome Statute that is the basis for the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed before a nation leaves the tribunal.
The ICC investigation covers 2011-2019, which includes the period when Duterte was mayor of Davao, a sprawling metropolis in the country's south, where his family has held power for decades.
Complaints filed against Duterte at the ICC allege that he kept a ""death squad"" of bounty hunters to go after drug suspects in Davao, and later replicated this model on a national scale when he was elected president.
Human Rights Watch called Duterte's arrest a ""critical step for accountability in the Philippines"".
Duterte built a reputation for Davao as one of the Philippines' safest cities, and cultivated the image of a tough-talking, anti-establishment man of the masses to pull off a dark horse win in the 2016 presidential elections.
Polls show he is the most popular Philippines president since the restoration of democracy in 1986.
His supporters have threatened to hold large rallies to protest against his arrest. They had asked the Supreme Court to issue a restraining order against the ICC warrant - but the court did not act before the former president was flown out on Tuesday.
On social media, where the Dutertes maintain a strong following, the reaction was mixed.
Many praised the ICC for delivering justice for those who died in the drug war, while others defended Duterte's legacy, with some calling for widespread rallies.
""Justice served,"" read a top-liked comment on TikTok.
""Philippines was safe during Duterte's time,"" another TikTok user wrote, saying the former leader built bridges, roads and other infrastructure. ""He was the best president.""

Reporting fromLondon","Pakistan's army says it has freed more than 300 hostages from a passenger train seized by militants in Balochistan province on Tuesday.
The military spokesperson said 33 militants were killed during the operation.
Twenty-one civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) before the operation began, the military spokesperson said. These numbers have not been verified by the BBC, and it is unclear how many passengers are unaccounted for.
The military continues its search operation in the area to rule out any remaining threats.
There were approximately 440 passengers on board the train when it was attacked, according to the army's spokesperson.
Security officials have been quoted as saying some of the militants may have left the train, taking an unknown number of passengers with them into the surrounding mountainous area.
The military is working to find the passengers who escaped and fled into the surrounding area during the attack, the spokesperson said.
The Pakistani authorities - as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US - have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation.
The BLA is one of the rebel groups demanding either greater autonomy or independence for Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province.
They accuse Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich mineral resources while also neglecting it. In the past, they have attacked military camps, railway stations and trains - but this is the first time they have hijacked a train.
At least 100 of those on the train were members of the security forces, officials have said.
The militants had threatened to kill hostages if authorities did not release Baloch political prisoners within 48 hours, according to local reports.
During the attack, the militants blew up a section of the tracks and opened fire on the train near a mountain tunnel.
Eyewitnesses described the ""doomsday scenes"" on board the train as the attack unfolded, with passenger Ishaq Noor telling the BBC: ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next.""
Officials had difficulty communicating with passengers at the time of the attack, because the remote area has no internet or mobile coverage.
Some passengers who managed to disembark from the train late on Tuesday evening walked for nearly four hours to reach the next railway station.
Among them was Muhammad Ashraf, who had been travelling from Quetta to Lahore to visit his family.
""We reached the station with great difficulty, because we were tired and there were children and women with us,"" he told the BBC.
Helicopters and hundreds of troops were deployed to rescue the hostages. More than 100 passengers had been freed by Wednesday morning.
The hijacking lasted more than 30 hours. Information relating to the attack and subsequent rescue operation has been tightly controlled throughout.
A spokesperson for the military said anyone involved in the attack would be brought to justice.

Reporting fromSingapore","Passengers who were freed from a train seized by armed militants have spoken of ""doomsday scenes"" that unfolded on board the Jaffar Express in Pakistan's Balochistan province.
""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next,"" Ishaq Noor, who was one of those on board, told the BBC.
He was one of more than 400 passengers travelling from Quetta to Peshawar on Tuesday when the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) attacked and took a number hostage. The train driver was among several reported injured.
Military sources claim 155 passengers have been freed and 27 militants killed. There is no independent confirmation of those figures. Rescue operations are continuing.
Security forces say they have deployed hundreds of troops to rescue the remaining passengers. Authorities have also deployed helicopters and special forces personnel.
The BLA has warned of ""severe consequences"" if an attempt is made to rescue hostages.
At least 100 of those on the train were members of the security forces, officials have said. It unclear how many passengers are still being held hostage - more than a dozen of those freed were taken to hospital for treatment.
Reports quoting security officials say some of the militants may have left the train, taking an unknown number of passengers with them into the surrounding mountainous area.
On Wednesday, the BBC saw dozens of wooden coffins being loaded at Quetta railway station. A railway official said they were empty and being transported to collect any possible casualties.
Muhammad Ashraf, who was travelling from Quetta to Lahore to visit family, was among a group of passengers who managed to disembark the train late on Tuesday.
""There was a lot of fear among the passengers. It was a scene of doomsday,"" he said.
The group then walked for nearly four hours to the next railway station. Several of the men carried the weaker passengers on their shoulders.
""We reached the station with great difficulty, because we were tired and there were children and women with us,"" he said.
Mr Noor, who was travelling with his wife and two children, said the initial explosion on the train was ""so intense"" that one of his children fell from the seat.
He and his wife each tried to shield one child amidst the gunfire.
""If a bullet comes our way, it will hit us and not the children,"" he said.
Mushtaq Muhammad, who was in the train's third carriage, recalled passengers stricken with panic.
""The attackers were talking to each other in Balochi, and their leader repeatedly told them to 'keep an eye' particularly on the security personnel to make sure that [the attackers] do not lose them,"" he said.
The attackers started to release some Balochistan residents, as well as women, children and elderly passengers, on Tuesday evening, Mr Ishaq said, adding that he was let go when he told them he was a resident of Turbat city in Balochistan, and they saw that he had children and women with him.
Meanwhile, relatives of the train's driver, Amjad Yasin, are anxiously awaiting news after hearing he was injured. He'd been a train driver for 24 years and survived when explosives targeted another train he was driving about eight years ago, they say.
""For the past couple of weeks, we were under severe stress that something is about to happen as there was an air of fear,"" his brother Amir told the BBC in Quetta.
The BLA has waged a decades-long insurgency to gain independence and has launched numerous deadly attacks, often targeting police stations, railway lines and highways.
Counter-insurgency operations in impoverished Balochistan by Pakistan's army and security forces have reportedly seen thousands of people disappear without trace since the early 2000s. The security forces are accused of crimes including torture and extra-judicial killings, allegations they deny.
Pakistani authorities - as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US - have designated the group a terrorist organisation.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it is ""gravely concerned"" by the train hijack.
""We strongly urge all relevant stakeholders to forge an urgent rights-based, pro-people consensus on the issues faced by citizens in Balochistan and to find a peaceful, political solution,"" it said in a statement on X.
The United Nations' Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has ""strongly condemned"" the train siege and also called for the immediate release of remaining passengers.

South East Asia Correspondent","Just short of his 80th birthday, Rodrigo Duterte, a man who once vowed to purge his country through a bloody anti-drugs and crime campaign, found himself outmanoeuvred and in custody.
The former president was met by Philippines police as he arrived in Manila on a flight from Hong Kong, where he had been rallying support for his candidates for the upcoming mid-term election among the large Filipino diaspora there.
The much-talked-about warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court (ICC) was, it turned out, already in the hands of the Philippines government, which moved swiftly to execute it.
A frail-looking Mr Duterte, walking with a stick, was moved to an air force base within the airport perimeter. A chartered jet was quickly prepared to take him to the ICC in The Hague.
How had this happened? How had a man so powerful and popular, often called ""the Trump of Asia"", been brought so low?
In vain, his lawyers and family members protested that the arrest had no legal basis and complained that Duterte's frail health was being neglected.
While in office, Mr Duterte formed an alliance with the Marcos family – the children of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos who had long been working on a political comeback. Mr Duterte could not run again in the 2022 election, but his daughter Sara, mayor of southern city of Davao, was also popular and a strong contender to replace him.
However, Ferdinand Marcos's son Bongbong, who had been in politics all his life, was also well placed to win and very well-funded.
The two families struck a deal. They would work together to get Bongbong into the presidency and Sara into the vice-presidency, on the assumption that come the next election in 2028, her turn would come and she would have the formidable Marcos machine behind her.
It worked. Both won their positions by a wide margin. Mr Duterte expected that his alliance would protect him from any blowback over his controversial presidency once he was out of power.
The most serious threat hanging over him was an investigation by the ICC into his culpability for thousands of extrajudicial killings carried out during anti-drugs campaigns he ordered - after he became president in 2016, but also during his tenure as mayor of the southern city of Davao from 2011.
Mr Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the ICC in 2019, but its prosecutors argued they still had a mandate to look into alleged crimes against humanity committed before that, and launched a formal investigation in 2021. However, President Marcos initially stated that his government would not co-operate with the ICC.
That position only changed after the dramatic breakdown of the Duterte-Marcos alliance. Strains in their relationship were evident from the earliest days of the administration, when Sara Duterte's request to be given control of the powerful defence ministry was turned down and she was given the education ministry instead.
President Marcos also distanced himself from his predecessor's mercurial policies, mending fences with the US, standing up to China in contested seas, and stopping the blood-curdling threats of retribution against drug dealers.
In the end, these were two ambitious, power-hungry clans aiming to dominate Filipino politics, and there was not enough power for them to share. Relations reached a nadir last year when Sara Duterte announced that she had hired an assassin to kill President Marcos, should anything happen to her.
Late last year, the lower house of Congress, which is controlled by Marcos loyalists, filed a petition to impeach Ms Duterte. That trial is due to take place in the Senate later this year.
If she is impeached, under the constitution, she would be barred from holding high political office, killing her long-standing presidential ambitions and weakening the political power of the Dutertes even further.
President Marcos now appears to have moved deftly to neutralise his main political rival. But his strategy is not risk-free. The Dutertes remain popular in much of the country, and may be able to mobilise protests against the former president's prosecution.
Sara Duterte has issued a statement accusing the government of surrendering her father to ""foreign powers"" and of violating Filipino sovereignty.
An early test of the support enjoyed by both clans will be the mid-term elections in May.
In his comments to journalists after the plane carrying his predecessor had taken off from Manila, President Marcos insisted he was meeting the country's commitments to Interpol, which had delivered the ICC warrant. But he was coy about the fact that it was an ICC warrant he was executing, given that many Filipinos will question what the ICC's remit is in a country which has already left its jurisdiction.
It is not risk-free for the ICC either. The court is an embattled institution these days, with the Trump administration threatening to arrest its top officials should they travel to the US, and few countries willing to extradite those it has indicted. Getting former President Duterte to The Hague might therefore look like a welcome high-profile success.
But there was a warning, from China – admittedly not a signatory to the ICC and currently at loggerheads with the Philippines – not to politicise ICC cases. This was a thinly-veiled reference to the fact that this case, which is supposed to be about accountability for serious international crimes, has ended up playing a decisive part in a domestic feud in the Philippines between two rival political forces.",Asia

Reporting fromBangkok","A plane carrying the former president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has left Manila after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over his deadly ""war on drugs"".
He was taken into police custody shortly after his arrival at the capital's international airport from Hong Kong on Tuesday morning.
Duterte, 79, contested his detention but within hours was on a chartered jet en route to The Hague in the Netherlands, where the ICC sits. Current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said the country was meeting its legal obligations.
During Duterte's time in office, thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial.
Marcos said his predecessor would face charges relating to what he described as Duterte's ""bloody war on drugs"".
""Interpol asked for help and we obliged,"" President Marcos told a press conference. ""This is what the international community expects of us.""
Duterte's daughter Sara, who said she would accompany him to The Hague, is vice president and a political rival of Marcos. She has said the arrest amounts to persecution.
Rodrigo Duterte has offered no apologies for his brutal anti-drugs crackdown, which saw more than 6,000 suspects killed when he was president from 2016 to 2022, and mayor of Davao city before that.
Nevertheless, he questioned the basis for the warrant, asking: ""What crime [have] I committed?"" in a video posted online on Tuesday by another daughter, Veronica Duterte.
""If I committed a sin, prosecute me in Philippine courts, with Filipino judges, and I will allow myself to be jailed in my own nation,"" he said in a later video.
In response to his arrest, a petition was launched on his behalf in the Supreme Court - urging it not to comply with the request.
According to a statement from the court's spokesperson, the former president also called for a declaration that the Philippines withdrawal from the ICC in 2019 ""effectively terminated"" its jurisdiction over the country and its people.
The ICC says it still has authority in the Philippines over alleged crimes committed before the country withdrew as a member.
Some of Duterte's supporters rallied at the airport compound, where the former president was taken following his arrest.
""I'm sad because I didn't think it would come to a point where he would be arrested. For me, he did a lot for our country and this is what they did to him,"" one supporter, Aikko Valdon, told the Reuters news agency.
State media said more than 370 police had been deployed to the airport and to other ""key locations"" to ensure peace was maintained.
While his supporters have criticised the arrest, activists have called it a ""historic moment"" for those who perished in his anti-drug war and their families, the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP) said.
""Duterte's arrest is the beginning of accountability for the mass killings that defined his brutal rule,"" said ICHRP chairman Peter Murphy.
The former leader had been in Hong Kong to campaign among the large Filipino diaspora there for the 12 May mid-term elections, in which he had planned to run again for mayor of Davao.
Duterte's arrest marks the ""beginning of a new chapter in Philippine history"", said political scientist Richard Heydarian. ""This is about rule of law and human rights.""
Heydarian added that authorities had arrested Duterte promptly instead of letting the matter take its course through the local courts to ""avoid political chaos"".
The Duterte and Marcos families formed a formidable alliance in the last elections in 2022, where against the elder Duterte's wishes, his daughter Sara ran as Marcos Jr's vice-president instead of seeking her father's post.
The relationship unravelled publicly in recent months as the two families pursued separate political agendas.
Marcos initially refused to co-operate with the ICC investigation, but as his relationship with the Duterte family deteriorated, he changed his stance.
The demand for justice in Duterte's drug war goes ""hand in hand"" with the political interests of President Marcos, Mr Heydarian said.
Duterte served as mayor of Davao, a sprawling southern metropolis, for 22 years and has made it one of the country's safest from street crimes.
He cast himself as a tough-talking anti-establishment politician to win the 2016 elections by a landslide.
With fiery rhetoric, he rallied security forces to shoot drug suspects dead. More than 6,000 suspects were killed by police or unknown assailants during the campaign, but rights groups say the number could be higher.
A previous UN report found that most victims were young, poor urban males and that police, who do not need search or arrest warrants to conduct house raids, systematically forced suspects to make self-incriminating statements or risk facing lethal force.
Critics said the campaign targeted street-level pushers and failed to catch big-time drug lords. Many families also claimed that the victims - their sons, brothers or husbands - were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Investigations in parliament pointed to a shadowy ""death squad"" of bounty hunters targeting drug suspects. Duterte has denied the allegations of abuse.
""Do not question my policies because I offer no apologies, no excuses. I did what I had to do, and whether or not you believe it... I did it for my country,"" Duterte told a parliament investigation in October.
""I hate drugs, make no mistake about it.""
The ICC first took note of the alleged abuses in 2016 and started its investigation in 2021. It covered cases from November 2011, when Duterte was mayor of Davao, to March 2019, before the Philippines withdrew from the ICC.
Since taking power, Marcos has scaled back Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign and promised a less violent approach to the drug problem, but hundreds of drug-related killings have been recorded during his administration.
Duterte remains widely popular in the Philippines as he is the country's first leader from Mindanao, a region south of Manila, where many feel marginalised by the leaders in the capital.
He often speaks in Cebuano, the regional language, not Tagalog, which is more widely-spoken in Manila and northern regions.
When he stepped down in 2022, nearly nine in 10 Filipinos said they were satisfied with his performance as president - a score unseen among his predecessors since the restoration of democracy in 1986, according to the Social Weather Stations research institute.
His populist rhetoric and blunt statements earned him the moniker ""Donald Trump of the East"". He has called Russian President Vladimir Putin his ""idol"" and under his administration, the Philippines' pivoted foreign policy to China away from the US, its long-standing ally.
Marcos restored Manila's ties with Washington and criticised the Duterte government for being ""Chinese lackeys"" as the Philippines is locked in sea dispute with China.
China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it was ""closely monitoring the development of the situation"" and warned the ICC against ""politicisation"" and ""double standards"" in the arrest of Duterte.
His political heir, Sara, is tipped as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. The incumbent, Marcos, is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election.

BBC News, Delhi","A war of words has erupted between the chief minister of a southern Indian state and the federal government over an education policy that, among other things, also deals with what languages children are taught in schools.
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 was introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government five years back and is being implemented in stages. It has made headlines recently after Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin alleged that the federal government was penalising his state for refusing to implement it - charges Delhi has denied.
A section of the policy recommends that students learn three languages. It doesn't mention any language specifically, but adds that at least two should be ""native to India"".
Stalin has cited a number of reasons for not implementing the NEP. But it is his allegation that the three-language policy will lead to the imposition of Hindi - the northern Indian language that is the most widely spoken in India - in his state that has dominated headlines recently.
India, where states are mostly organised on linguistic lines, has nearly two dozen official languages, including Hindi, Tamil and English. But southern states have often protested against efforts by successive federal governments to privilege Hindi over other languages.
It is an especially sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu, which has historically been at the forefront of such protests.
The issue led to heated exchanges in India's parliament on Monday, with federal Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan accusing Stalin and his party members of ""mischief"".
""Their only job is to raise language barriers. They are undemocratic and uncivilised,"" Pradhan said, sparking protests by Stalin's party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, in Tamil Nadu.
Education is a part of the constitution's ""concurrent"" list, which means that both the federal and state governments can make and enact laws around it. Schools and colleges follow different syllabi and rules depending on who oversees them - the federal or state governments.
The National Education Policy aims to promote and regulate education in India and the government updates it occasionally, with the NEP 2020 being the fourth iteration.
The three-language formula has found place in the NEP from its first version in 1968 and has often faced pushback from states, including Tamil Nadu. Many of its recommendations were not legally binding on state-run schools - Tamil Nadu, for instance, teaches only two languages, English and Tamil, in schools it runs. The state's leaders have argued that learning their mother tongue, Tamil, helps children learn subjects better while English opens up more promising opportunities.
Tamil Nadu government schools have also performed well over the years on surveys measuring parameters including access to education and quality of infrastructure.
The latest NEP says that the ""three-language policy will continue to be implemented"" but adds that - unlike earlier versions - there will be ""greater flexibility"" and that ""no language will be imposed on any state"".
But Stalin and his party - who say they are not against Hindi itself - have argued over the past few weeks that the policy's eventual aim is to force the language on non-Hindi-speaking states.
The chief minister wrote on X last month that Hindi - which emerged as a standardised language for easy communication during the British era - ended up dominating other languages and dialects spoken in northern India, such as Bhojpuri and Awadhi.
His party's MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi also recently questioned why a student should be forced to learn three languages.
""Students have enough burden in schools. You have to learn so many subjects, and on top of that you are forced to learn three languages instead of two,"" she told the Indian Express newspaper.
But Pradhan has denied allegations that the policy will force Hindi through.
""We have never said in NEP 2020 that only Hindi will be there; we have only said that education will be based on mother tongue - in Tamil Nadu, it will be Tamil,"" he told reporters last week.
The latest controversy has been exacerbated by Tamil Nadu's claims that it has not been allotted its share of funds for Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan - a school education programme partially funded by the federal government - due to the state's refusal to implement the NEP.
The Hindu newspaper reported last August that the federal government had asked Tamil Nadu to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to participate in the scheme. However, according to the MoU, participating in the scheme meant that the state had to adopt NEP 2020 ""in its entirety"".
In December, a junior federal minister told parliament that Tamil Nadu did not sign the MoU for the scheme despite agreeing initially - a claim the DMK denied, saying it never agreed to do so.
In February, Stalin wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to urgently release the funds, amounting to around 21.5bn rupees ($247m; £191m).
India is one of the world's most linguistically diverse countries and some estimates say thousands of languages are spoken here.
But there are only 22 official languages, with Hindi - spoken by more than 46% of the population - being the most widely used, according to the last census held in 2011.
After the British left India in 1947, the newly independent nation sought to promote Hindi as a link language to replace English. The constitution - enacted in 1950 - also nudges the federal government to promote the spread of Hindi.
This invited fierce opposition from non-Hindi-speaking states, prompting the federal government to continue using English as an alternate official language for 15 years after 1950.
As the deadline year of 1965 approached, violent protests over fears of Hindi ""imposition"" erupted again across Tamil Nadu, leading the federal government to pass a law that assured the continued use of English as an official language.
However, successive federal governments have introduced policies or made announcements that have kept these anxieties simmering.
The 1968 NEP adopted the three-language formula for the first time and, in the same year, the government introduced policies mandating the teaching of Hindi in non-Hindi speaking states, leading to fresh protests.
Over the years, the issue of Hindi versus other languages has made headlines repeatedly. In 2023, Stalin criticised the Modi government for replacing some colonial-era laws with ones bearing Hindi names (the Indian Penal Code, for instance, has been replaced with a law named Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita).
A federal government commission that examined the language policy during 1948-49 acknowledged that the issue's sentimental nature made it ""difficult to consider it in a calm and detached manner"".
""No other problem has caused greater controversy among educationists and evoked more contradictory views from our witnesses,"" it said.

BBC News, Delhi","Air India has confirmed that one of its flights from the US was forced to turn around last week after passengers trying to flush away plastic bags, rags and clothes clogged up most of its toilets.
The plane, which was heading from Chicago to India's capital Delhi, spent several hours in the air before it returned to the US city.
Video clips from inside the aircraft showed scenes of confusion as passengers huddled around crew members who seemed to be explaining the situation.
The incident has stirred a lively debate on social media, with many Indians weighing in on aeroplane bathroom etiquette.
The incident took place on 5 March on Air India Flight 126, according to a statement by the airline released on Monday.
About two hours into the flight, crew members reported that some of the toilets were ""unserviceable"".
Subsequently, they found eight of the 12 toilets in business and economy class could not be used, ""causing discomfort to all on board"". The plane can carry up to 342 passengers.
At that point the plane was already flying over the Atlantic Ocean, according to Air India's statement. Due to restrictions on night operations at most European airports at the time, the pilots decided to return to Chicago for ""passenger comfort and safety"".
A BBC check on flight tracking website Flightradar24 found the plane was near Greenland when it turned around, and had spent a total of 10 hours in the air.
Air India said an investigation later found ""polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing"" of the plane's toilets.
It released several pictures showing bags containing waste cleared from the toilets. One photo showed a crew member holding a drainage pipe completely stuffed with what appeared to be rags.
The statement said that all passengers and crew disembarked normally in Chicago and were provided with accommodation and alternative flight options.
Plane toilets store human waste in special tanks and use a vacuum system for flushing. These are normally disposed of once the plane has landed.
While clogged toilets are not uncommon, it is ""next to impossible"" for all toilets to break down ""due to only passengers' fault, and in a way that it causes an emergency diversion"", Mark Martin, an aviation expert, told the Hindustan Times newspaper.
But Air India said it had previously found objects such as blankets, underwear and diapers flushed down its planes' toilets.
""We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for,"" it said.
On X, many criticised the airline for poor upkeep and the lack of sanitation facilities on its aeroplanes.
""Only Air India has such frequent mishaps. Honestly what has happened is indefensible,"" one user said.
But others pointed out that the airline could not be held responsible for the situation.
""Can we honestly dump all the blame on Air India and the crew, when people can't follow basic travel etiquette?"" another user said.

BBC News","An Indonesian TikToker has been sentenced to almost three years in prison after reportedly 'talking' to a picture of Jesus on her phone and telling him to get a haircut.
Ratu Thalisa, a Muslim transgender woman with more than 442,000 TikTok followers, had been on a livestream, and was responding to a comment that told her to cut her hair to look more like a man.
On Monday, a court in Medan, Sumatra found Thalisa guilty of spreading hatred under a controversial online hate-speech law, and sentenced her to two years and 10 months in jail.
The court said her comments could disrupt ""public order"" and ""religious harmony"" in society, and charged her with committing blasphemy.
The court ruling came after multiple Christian groups filed police complaints against Ms Thalisa for blasphemy.
The sentence has been condemned by human rights groups, including Amnesty International, who described it as ""a shocking attack on Ratu Thalisa's freedom of expression"" and called for it to be quashed.
""The Indonesian authorities should not use the country's Electronic Information and Transactions (EIT) law to punish people for comments made on social media,"" Amnesty International Indonesia's Executive Director Usman Hamid said in a statement.
""While Indonesia should prohibit the advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, Ratu Thalisa's speech act does not reach that threshold.""
Mr Hamid called on Indonesian authorities to overturn Ms Thalisa's conviction and ensure her immediate release from custody.
He also urged them to repeal or make substantial revisions to what he described as ""problematic provisions"" in the EIT Law – namely, those criminalising alleged immorality, defamation and hate speech.
First introduced in 2008 and amended in 2016 to address online defamation, the EIT Law was designed to safeguard the rights of individuals in online spaces.
It has been roundly criticised, however, by rights groups, press groups and legal experts, who have long raised concerns about the law's potential threat to freedom of expression.
At least 560 people were charged with alleged violations of the EIT Law while exercising their freedom of expression between 2019 and 2024, and 421 were convicted, according to data from Amnesty International.
Those charged with offenses of defamation and hate speech have included several social media influencers.
In September 2023, a Muslim woman was sentenced to two years' prison for blaspheming Islam, after she posted a viral TikTok video where she said an Islamic phrase before eating pork.
In 2024, another TikToker was detained for blasphemy after they posted a quiz asking children what kind of animals can read the Quran, according to Amnesty International.
Indonesia is home to many religious minorities, including Buddhists, Christians and Hindus. But a vast majority of Indonesians are Muslim – and most cases of people found in violation of the EIT Law have typically related to religious minorities allegedly insulting Islam.
Ms Thalisa's case, where a Muslim woman is accused of invoking hate speech against Christianity, is less common.
Prosecutors previously demanded that she receive a sentence of more than four years, and immediately appealed against Monday's verdict. Ms Thalisa was given seven days to appeal.",Asia

BBC News","South Korean singer Wheesung was found dead on Monday at his home in Seoul.
Emergency services found the 43-year-old unresponsive after being alerted by his mother, local media reported.
The authorities said that an autopsy had been requested, but that there were no signs of foul play.
Wheesung, whose real name is Choi Whee-sung, debuted in 2002 and quickly made a name for himself with his soulful vocals. He was popular in the 2000s and has been credited with popularising R&B in South Korea.
Over the years Wheesung established himself as a mentor and vocal coach to K-pop stars, even writing songs for some of them. He collaborated with many artists and also performed in K-pop concerts across the world, including in Hollywood.
He was scheduled to hold a concert with ballad singer KCM this weekend in the city of Daegu.
His R&B ballads won praise from veteran Korean singers like Shin Seung-hun and Seo Tae-ji.
But Wheesung was also no stranger to controversy.
In 2021, he was handed a two-year suspended sentence for abusing propofol, a powerful anesthetic which also caused the death of Michael Jackson.
Within days in March and April 2020, Wheesung was found unconscious on two occasions, along with syringes and vials containing etomidate, a sleep-inducing drug similar to propofol.
Fellow artists shared tributes to Wheesung after news of his death broke.
""Wheesung, let's sing and make music freely in that place. I won't forget your pure and clear heart,"" singer Yoon Min-soo wrote in a social media post accompanied by a video of him and Wheesung performing a duet.
""Let's meet again someday and sing together,"" Yoon wrote.
Rapper Verbal Jint shared posted a black square on Instagram, accompanied with the caption: ""Every moment we shared was an honor, and I'm grateful. You've worked so hard, rest in peace, Wheesung.""",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg8jqj393eo,From chatbots to intelligent toys: How AI is booming in China,2025-03-10T22:34:20.067Z,"Laura Bicker
China correspondent
Reporting fromBeijing","Head in hands, eight-year-old Timmy muttered to himself as he tried to beat a robot powered by artificial intelligence at a game of chess.
But this was not an AI showroom or laboratory – this robot was living on a coffee table in a Beijing apartment, along with Timmy.
The first night it came home, Timmy hugged his little robot friend before heading to bed. He doesn't have a name for it – yet.
""It's like a little teacher or a little friend,"" the boy said, as he showed his mum the next move he was considering on the chess board.
Moments later, the robot chimed in: ""Congrats! You win."" Round eyes blinking on the screen, it began rearranging the pieces to start a new game as it continued in Mandarin: ""I've seen your ability, I will do better next time.""
China is embracing AI in its bid to become a tech superpower by 2030.
DeepSeek, the breakthrough Chinese chatbot that caught the world's attention in January, was just the first hint of that ambition.
Money is pouring into AI businesses seeking more capital, fuelling domestic competition. There are more than 4,500 firms developing and selling AI, schools in the capital Beijing are introducing AI courses for primary and secondary students later this year, and universities have increased the number of places available for students studying AI.
""This is an inevitable trend. We will co-exist with AI,"" said Timmy's mum, Yan Xue. ""Children should get to know it as early as possible. We should not reject it.""
She is keen for her son to learn both chess and the strategy board game Go – the robot does both, which persuaded her that its $800 price tag was a good investment. Its creators are already planning to add a language tutoring programme.
Perhaps this was what the Chinese Communist Party hoped for when it declared in 2017 that AI would be ""the main driving force"" of the country's progress. President Xi Jinping is now betting big on it, as a slowing Chinese economy grapples with the blow of tariffs from its biggest trading partner, the United States.
Beijing plans to invest 10tn Chinese yuan ($1.4tn; £1tn) in the next 15 years as it competes with Washington to gain the edge in advanced tech. AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.
But DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts – they did not expect China to catch up so soon.
It's a reaction Tommy Tang has become accustomed to after six months of marketing his firm's chess-playing robot at various competitions.
Timmy's machine comes from the same company, SenseRobot, which offers a wide range in abilities – Chinese state media hailed an advanced version in 2022 that beat chess Grand Masters at the game.
""Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,"" Mr Tang said, smiling. ""There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.""
His firm has sold more than 100,000 of the robots and now has a contract with a major US supermarket chain, Costco.
One of the secrets to China's engineering success is its young people. In 2020, more than 3.5 million of the country's students graduated with degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths, better known as STEM.
That's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. ""Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,"" Xi told party leaders last week.
Ever since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has ""been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,"" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. ""In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.""
Behind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.
The company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.
""Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,"" Mr Lyu insists.
The success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and ""is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,"" he added.
""It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.""
Six homegrown AI firms, including DeepSeek, have now been nicknamed China's six little dragons by the internet – the others are Unitree Robotics, Deep Robotics, BrainCo, Game Science, and Manycore Tech.
Some of them were at a recent AI fair in Shanghai, where the biggest Chinese firms in the business showed off their advances, from search and rescue robots to a backflipping dog-like one, which wandered the halls among visitors.
In one bustling exhibition hall, two teams of humanoid robots battled it out in a game of football, complete in red and blue jerseys. The machines fell when they clashed – and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.
It was hard to miss the air of excitement among developers in the wake of DeepSeek. ""Deepseek means the world knows we are here,"" said Yu Jingji, a 26-year-old engineer.
But as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.
AI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.
The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.
But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.
That same fear – where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.
Chinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that ""privacy was a red line"" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.
""DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,"" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that ""the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain"".
But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage – because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.
So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. ""This was our Mission Impossible,"" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.
So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.
""This is innovation,"" he says. ""Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.""
This could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.
Xi has repeatedly declared ""technological self-reliance"" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.
The Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race – the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for ""AI triumphalism"" because China was still in ""catch-up mode"".
President Xi is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, robots and advanced tech in preparation for a marathon that he hopes China will eventually win.",Asia

BBC Hindi, Bengaluru","Hundreds of foreign tourists have left a Unesco heritage site in southern India in the past few days after two women - an Israeli tourist and an Indian homestay owner - were gang-raped and a man was murdered.
The three were stargazing with two other male tourists near the town of Hampi in Karnataka state last Thursday when they were attacked by three men following an argument over money, police said.
All three suspects wanted in connection with the crime have been arrested.
The incident, which made global headlines, sparked fear among tourists and sent shockwaves through India.
Once the capital of the Hindu Vijayanagara kingdom, Hampi is described as an open-air museum, filled with magnificent stone ruins on the banks of Tungabhadra river. It was declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1986.
Thursday's assault took place in Sanapur village, which is about 28km (17 miles) from the main ruins of Hampi.
Located on the other side of the river from Hampi, the village is ""a very isolated area"", says Ram Arasiddi, the superintendent of police of the district.
Many tourists, especially from Israel and Europe, who visit Hampi stay at Sanapur, which also has towering ruins and a famous Hindu temple.
""Overall, about 100,000 or more foreign tourists visit the area every year,'' says Virupaksha V Hampi, general secretary of the Karnataka tourist guides' association.
However, since the news of the attack, most visitors have either cancelled bookings or left.
""Almost 90% of the tourists, most of whom are Israelis, have vacated homestays and left the area after Thursday,"" Syed Ismael, a tour guide, told BBC Hindi.
Mr Ismael added that those who were staying had been advised to move in groups and avoid venturing too far out.
Some said they've had to make last-minute changes to their plans.
""The incident is really scary and we are concerned about our safety. We had plans to stay here until [the Hindu festival of] Holi, but now we will be heading to Rajasthan state,"" Talia Zilber, a 21-year-old Israeli tourist, told The Indian Express newspaper. Mr Zilber left the guest house where he was staying with his five friends on Sunday.
State minister Shivaraj Tangadagi has also cautioned people against travelling late at night in the area.
According to one survivor's testimony, the group was stargazing near a temple when three men arrived on a motorcycle and asked where they could get petrol.
They gave them directions but the men then demanded 100 rupees ($1.15; £0.90) from them.
The group initially refused as they didn't know the men, but one male tourist eventually gave them 20 rupees.
The men then began arguing with the tourists which led to a confrontation.
The attackers pushed the three men into a nearby river canal before raping the women, Mr Arasiddi said on Saturday.
Two men swam to safety while the third, from Odisha state, drowned.
Police say they have filed a case for attempted murder, robbery and rape based on the survivors' testimony.
Two suspects were arrested on Saturday while a third man was arrested from neighbouring Tamil Nadu state on Sunday. He is being brought to Karnataka on Monday.
Violent crimes against women continue in India despite tough laws. The 2012 gang rape and murder of a medical student by a group of men in the capital Delhi drew global attention and triggered large-scale protests.
The incident prompted authorities to introduce stricter rape laws in 2013. Yet, tens of thousands of cases are reported each year. The National Crime Records Bureau reported nearly 32,000 rapes in India in 2022.
Experts believe many rapes go unreported because of social stigma, distrust of police and lack of confidence in the justice system.
In 2023, public outrage followed the alleged gang rape of a Brazilian-Spanish tourist in Jharkhand state. The victim and her husband shared their ordeal on Instagram, but later removed their posts.

BBC News, Mumbai","The prime minister of Vanuatu has ordered the cancellation of a passport issued by the island nation to fugitive Indian businessman Lalit Modi, who is wanted by Delhi in a corruption case.
The order came three days after India confirmed that Mr Modi had got citizenship of Vanuatu, a string of more than 80 islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Mr Modi, the former chief of the Indian Premier League (IPL), is wanted for allegedly rigging bids during his tenure as the head of the world's richest cricket tournament.
Mr Modi, who has been living in the UK since 2010, has always denied the allegations.
India has made several unsuccessful attempts to extradite him.
On Friday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters that Mr Modi had applied to surrender his Indian passport in London.
""We are also given to understand that he has acquired citizenship of Vanuatu. We continue to pursue the case against him as required under law,"" Jaiswal had said.
The news of Mr Modi becoming a Vanuatu citizen had made headlines in India, where he was once the face of the glamorous, cash-rich IPL tournament. He was a regular presence on the social scene, rubbing shoulders with Bollywood stars and India's elite.
But on Monday, Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat announced that his country had decided to cancel Mr Modi's citizenship.
Napat said a Vanuatu passport was a ""privilege"" and that ""applicants must seek citizenship for legitimate reasons"".
""None of those legitimate reasons include attempting to avoid extradition, which the recent facts brought to light clearly indicate was Mr Modi's intention,"" a media release quoted Napat as saying.
He said that background checks and Interpol screenings conducted during Mr Modi's application for a passport had shown no criminal convictions.
But, he added, that in the past 24 hours, he had been made aware that Interpol had twice rejected India's requests to issue an alert notice on Mr Modi, citing a lack of ""substantive judicial evidence"".
""Any such alert would've triggered an automatic rejection of Mr Modi's citizenship application,"" the release added.
The move is likely to bring relief to Indian authorities. Unlike the UK, Vanuatu does not have an extradition treaty with India.
Extradition treaties allow repatriation of people accused of crimes between countries.
A day earlier, Mr Modi wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that there were no cases pending against him in any court in India and accused the media of peddling ""fake news"" about him.
Mr Modi was instrumental in founding the IPL in 2008, which has now become a multi-billion-dollar industry.
The main accusations against Mr Modi relate to rigging bids during the auction of two team franchises in 2010. He was also accused of selling broadcasting and internet rights without authorisation.
In 2013, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) banned Mr Modi from any involvement in cricket activities for life.

Reporting fromBangkok","A former Thai police chief who was jailed for life three years ago for torturing a drug suspect to death has been found dead in his Bangkok jail cell, authorities said.
Thitisan Utthanaphon, who was nicknamed Joe Ferrari for his many luxury cars, died by suicide, according to a preliminary autopsy.
In 2021, a leaked video showed Thitisan and his colleagues wrapping plastic bags around the head of a 24-year-old drug suspect during an interrogation, leading to the suspect's death.
The video sparked national outrage at that time over police brutality in Thailand. It has made fresh rounds on social media in the wake of Thitisan's death.
Thailand's justice ministry has launched an investigation into his death after his family expressed doubts that he killed himself. Further tests were needed to confirm that he had indeed died in a suicide, authorities said.
Justice minister Tawee Sodsong said on Monday that all evidence related to Thitisan's death should be disclosed, and urged prison authorities to cooperate with investigators.
The family said Thitisan was previously assaulted by a prison staffer. They said officials did not allow them to see his body, which was found in his cell on Friday.
But on Sunday authorities said ""no prison officer or inmate has harmed or caused [his] death"".
A previous raid on Thitisan's house revealed that he owned a dozen luxury sportscars. Authorities believe he owned at least 42, one of them a rare Lamborghini Aventador Anniversario, of which only 100 were made, priced in Thailand at 47 million baht ($1.45m; £1.05m).
As a police colonel, Thitisan was paid about $1,000 a month.
There were allegations that he demanded bribes from the suspect in the viral video, Jirapong Thanapat, while suffocating him. Thitisan denied this.
Thitisan surrendered in 2021 following a manhunt.
Besides Thitisan, five other police officers were convicted of murdering Jirapong and were also sentenced to life in prison in 2022.
""It's like he has paid off the karma he committed,"" Jirapong's father said in an interview on local media on Saturday.
The Department of Corrections said they had been investigating a previous complaint filed by Thitisan's family alleging that he had been bullied and assaulted by prison officers earlier this year.
Thitisan had consulted doctors over anxiety issues and trouble sleeping, the department said.
His family visited him on the day that he died and prison staff did not notice any ""abnormalities"", it said.

BBC News, Mumbai•@Nik_inamdar","A shorter winter has literally left Nitin Goel out in the cold.
For 50 years, his family's clothing business in India's northwestern textile city of Ludhiana has made jackets, sweaters and sweatshirts. But with the early onset of summer this year, the company is staring at a washout season and having to shift gears.
""We've had to start making t-shirts instead of sweaters as the winter is getting shorter with each passing year. Our sales have halved in the last five years and are down a further 10% during this season,"" Goel told the BBC. ""The only recent exception to this was Covid, when temperatures dropped significantly.""
Across India as cool weather beats a hasty retreat, anxieties are building up at farms and factories, with cropping patterns and business plans getting upended.
Data from the Indian Meteorological Department shows that last month was India's hottest February in 125 years. The weekly average minimum temperature was also above normal by 1-3C in many parts of the country.
Above-normal maximum temperatures and heatwaves are likely to persist over most parts of the country between March and May, the weather agency has warned.
For small business owners like Goel, such erratic weather has meant much more than just slowing sales. His whole business model, practised and perfected over decades, has had to change.
Goel's company supplies clothes to multi-brand outlets across India. And they are no longer paying him on delivery, he says, instead adopting a ""sale or return"" model where consignments not sold are returned to the company, entirely transferring the risk to the manufacturer.
He has also had to offer bigger discounts and incentives to his clients this year.
""Big retailers haven't picked up goods despite confirmed orders,"" says Goel, adding that some small businesses in his town have had to shut shop as a result.
Nearly 1,200 miles away in Devgad town on India's western coast, the heat has wreaked havoc on India's much-loved Alphonso mango orchards.
""Production this year would be only around 30% of the normal yield,"" said Vidyadhar Joshi, a farmer who owns 1,500 trees.
The sweet, fleshy and richly aromatic Alphonso is a prized export from the region, but yields across the districts of Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, where the variety is predominantly grown, are lower, according to Joshi.
""We might make losses this year,"" Joshi adds, because he has had to spend more than usual on irrigation and fertilisers in a bid to salvage the crop.
According to him, many other farmers in the area were even sending labourers, who come from Nepal to work in the orchards, back home because there wasn't enough to do.
Scorching heat is also threatening winter staples such as wheat, chickpea and rapeseed.
While the country's agriculture minister has dismissed concerns about poor yields and predicted that India will have a bumper wheat harvest this year, independent experts are less hopeful.
Heatwaves in 2022 lowered yields by 15-25% and ""similar trends could follow this year"", says Abhishek Jain of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (Ceew) think tank.
India - the world's second largest wheat producer - will have to rely on expensive imports in the event of such disruptions. And its protracted ban on exports, announced in 2022, may continue for even longer.
Economists are also worried about the impact of rising temperatures on availability of water for agriculture.
Reservoir levels in northern India have already dropped to 28% of capacity, down from 37% last year, according to Ceew. This could affect fruit and vegetable yields and the dairy sector, which has already experienced a decline in milk production of up to 15% in some parts of the country.
""These things have the potential to push inflation up and reverse the 4% target that the central bank has been talking about,"" says Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda.
Food prices in India have recently begun to soften after remaining high for several months, leading to rate cuts after a prolonged pause.
GDP in Asia's third largest economy has also been supported by accelerating rural consumption recently after hitting a seven-quarter low last year. Any setback to this farm-led recovery could affect overall growth, at a time when urban households have been cutting back and private investment hasn't picked up.
Think tanks like Ceew say a range of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of recurrent heatwaves needs to be thought through, including better weather forecasting infrastructure, agriculture insurance and evolving cropping calendars with climate models to reduce risks and improve yields.
As a primarily agrarian country, India is particularly vulnerable to climate change.
Ceew estimates three out of every four Indian districts are ""extreme event hotspots"" and 40% exhibit what is called ""a swapping trend"" - which means traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa.
The country is expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030, according to one estimate. Climate Transparency, the advocacy group, had pegged India's potential income loss across services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors from labour capacity reduction due to extreme heat at $159bn in 2021- or 5.4% of its GDP.
Without urgent action, India risks a future where heatwaves threaten both lives and economic stability.

BBC News","Two women were gang-raped and a man was killed in an attack near a popular Unesco World Heritage site in southern India, according to police.
The two women - an Israeli tourist and an Indian homestay operator - were stargazing with three male tourists near a lake in the city of Hampi, Karnataka, when they were attacked by a group of men on Thursday night, police superintendent Ram Arasiddi told Reuters.
Arasiddi said the assailants pushed the men into the Tungabhadra River canal before raping the women.
Two of the men, one of them American, survived, and the third man's body was recovered on Saturday morning, he said.
""Five people - two women and three men - were attacked near Sanapur,"" Arasiddi said.
""Two of them are foreigners, an American [man], and another a woman from Israel.""
Police have arrested two of the men accused of the attack and an investigation is ongoing, Arasiddi said. Police believe the men followed the group.
The US State Department said it was ""aware of reports that a US citizen was among a group of victims of violent crime"" near Hampi.
According to witness testimony from one of the women, the group was stargazing near a temple in Sanapur when three men arrived on a motorcycle and asked them where they could get petrol.
As one member of the group gave them directions, one of the three men demanded 100 rupees ($1.29) from the tourists.
""Since the homestay operator did not know them, she told them they had no money,"" police said.
""When the men repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.
""After that, the three men allegedly started arguing.""
The body of one of the male tourists was later found in the Tungabhadra canal in Karnataka's Koppal district.
A case has been registered at Gangavathi Rural Police Station under sections related to extortion, robbery, gang rape and attempted murder.
The victims are receiving medical treatment at a government hospital, the police said.
Hampi, an ancient village in the south Indian state of Karnataka, is home to numerous ruins and temples from the Vijayanagara Empire. It was declared as a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1986.
In a post on X, Chief Minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah wrote: ""The attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and homestay owner is a most heinous act.
""As soon as the incident was reported, I obtained information from the relevant police, conducted a thorough investigation, and instructed them to quickly identify the culprits.
""The police have arrested two accused in connection with the case and are continuing the investigation.""
Attacks on women in India gained international attention last year after the brutal rape-homicide of a junior doctor at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata.
The attack sparked national outrage and protests over a lack of safety for women.",Asia

BBC News, Delhi","About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.
He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the ""devilish"" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and ""seducing"" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.
Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.
The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who ""moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music"", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.
But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an ""aggressive and reckless man"", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.
Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.
Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.
A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.
Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as ""the all-knowing master of the universe"", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and ""scientific astrologers"".
He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.
""He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,"" Kappal says.
But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.
Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.
Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. ""Drugs destroyed me completely,"" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. ""I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.""
In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth
""What goes around comes around, I really believe that,"" he said recently. ""It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.""
Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.
""This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,"" he's often heard saying.
Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. ""I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,"" he says.
But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. ""My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.""
So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.
For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.
Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.
Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.
""A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,"" he told Lallantop.
But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.
""I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,"" he told Lallantop.
In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. ""I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.""
Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.
""I have been to hell and back,"" he says in Famous. ""Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.""
Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.
""No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,"" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based student.
Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. ""Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,"" says listener Bushra Neyazi.
No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.
""I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,"" he said recently.
""I am back and I want the same love I received seven years ago.""

BBC News","The head of Myanmar's military government has said the country will hold a national election in December 2025 or January 2026.
General Min Aung Hlaing said the elections would be ""free and fair"" - adding that 53 political parties had already submitted their lists to participate.
It would be the first vote since his military junta seized power in a 2021 coup, arresting and imprisoning democratically elected leader Aung San Sung Kyi and making unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the previous year's elections.
Since then, the country has been in turmoil, with a protest movement against the junta turning into an armed rebellion across the country.
Critics have described the announcement as a sham designed to maintain the junta's power through proxy political parties.
Human Rights Watch, an NGO, told the BBC: ""The junta is delusional if they think an election under the current circumstances will be considered remotely credible.
""As a precursor to elections, they need to end the violence, release all those arbitrarily detained, and allow all political parties to register and participate instead of dissolving opposition parties.""
The military junta has carried out a violent crackdown on dissent since taking power, executing democracy activists and imprisoning journalists.
But it has struggled to contain a widespread insurgency involving pro-democracy and ethnic rebel groups, and has limited control outside major cities.
The UN, citing the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), said in January that at least 6,231 civilians have been killed by the military, including 1,144 women and 709 children, over the past four years.
It warned in September that Myanmar was ""sinking into an abyss of human suffering"".",Asia

Reporting fromSeoul","South Korea's impeached president has been released from detention after a court in Seoul overturned his arrest on technical grounds.
Yoon Suk Yeol walked free on Saturday to cheers from his supporters - but still faces trial on insurrection charges after his failed attempt to impose martial law in December.
He was arrested in January in a dawn raid at the presidential palace after a tense fortnight where he had resisted being taken in and there were clashes between his security detail and police.
But he walked free on Saturday after 52 days in custody. ""I bow my head in gratitude to the people of this nation,"" he said in a statement distributed by his lawyers following his release.
After waving to supporters outside the centre, he was driven in an official convoy back to the presidential compound in Seoul, where he was greeted by more supporters.
More than 50,000 protesters staged rallies in his support in the capital on Saturday, while there was also a slightly smaller counter-protest, Yonhap reported.
Mr Yoon's lawyers secured his release after arguing it was illegal to hold him in custody. The courts agreed, based on a number of legal technicalities, although the prosecutors described the ruling as ""unjust"".
He is due to stand trial later this year for the attempt to put the democratic country under martial law. It only lasted six hours - but polarised the nation.
If convicted he could face life in prison or even the death penalty.
Although currently suspended from office, Mr Yoon is still South Korea's president in name.
He also faces a separate Constitutional Court ruling which will decide on whether to uphold his impeachment and formally strip him from office. The judges' decision is expected in the coming days.
Despite the court cases, Mr Yoon's supporters have rallied around him - and authorities are bracing themselves for unrest.",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlye6yvrgzo,Who's doing the dishes? Bollywood film and government data have the same answer,2025-03-08T00:27:37.264Z,"Cherylann Mollan
BBC News, Mumbai","A new Bollywood film - Mrs - has once again laid bare a stark reality: even in well-educated households in India a woman's role is often confined to unpaid domestic work.
The protagonist, married to a gynaecologist, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and caregiving. Her dreams are sidelined not by force, but by relentless criticism and quiet coercion.
While the film, which is a remake of the hit Malayalam movie The Great Indian Kitchen, has sparked conversation - and pushback, especially from men on social media - its themes resonate with hard data.
A recent government survey reveals that Indian women spend over seven hours a day on unpaid domestic and caregiving work - more than twice the time men do. Data shows that women spend 289 minutes on unpaid domestic work and 137 minutes on unpaid caregiving, whereas men spend 88 minutes on chores and 75 minutes on care work.
They also spent less time than men doing paid work and engaging in self-care activities.
What's disappointing is that the last such survey which came out six years ago had similar results. Despite the government launching campaigns to empower women, the situation hasn't changed much.
India's Time Use Surveys (TUS) track how people spend their time across various activities. Surveyors gather data nationwide by asking individuals aged six to 59 how they spent the previous day. The first TUS was released in 2019, with the second published last week.
When the government released findings from the second Time Use Survey (TUS), it highlighted two key shifts: women aged 15 to 59 spent 10 minutes less on unpaid domestic work, while their participation in employment and related activities rose by just over three percentage points.
The survey concluded this marked a ""shift from unpaid to paid activities"" for women - a positive sign that they were spending less time on domestic chores and more time in paid employment.
However, economists argue this isn't necessarily true. Even if it is, the slight drop in domestic work suggests women are still juggling paid jobs with a heavier load of unpaid work than men.
Ashwini Deshpande, an economics professor at Ashoka University, says TUS data should be analysed alongside India's Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) for a deeper understanding of how women spend their time. FLFPR measures the percentage of women aged 15 and above in the labour force.
According to government data, the FLFPR grew from about 23% in 2017-2018 to 37% in 2022-2023. Prof Deshpande says that this increase is not solely due to an increase in employment opportunities for women, but has also been spurred by economic distress.
""Women are not waiting for their time spent on domestic chores to reduce to take up jobs. Research shows that women want to work to supplement household incomes and so they end up working 'double-shifts', doing paid work outside the home and unpaid work inside,"" Prof Deshpande says.
Indian women aren't alone in shouldering a disproportionate share of household and caregiving work - it's a global reality. However, the gap in time spent on domestic work is significantly wider in India.
Where globally women spend about 2.8 hours more than men on domestic and care work, for Indian women, this difference is closer to four hours.
Sociologists attribute this to India's deeply patriarchal society, which continues to enforce strict gender norms. Even among the educated elite, women remain confined by roles upheld and perpetuated not just by men, but also by women.
This rigid enforcement of gender roles doesn't just shape women's lives - it also shapes the way stories about them are received.
So, while Mrs struck a chord with many, it also faced sharp criticism - especially from men on social media.
A men's rights group accused it of ""spreading toxicity"" against traditional joint families, while others dismissed its premise altogether.
Kajol Srinivasan, a Mumbai-based comedian, says the film ruffled feathers because it held up an uncomfortable mirror to society.
She told the BBC how her father, who quit his job at 40 to take over household duties while her mother continued working, quickly realised that housework was no easy task.
""The first week he was excited; he cooked different dishes and deep-cleaned the house,"" she says.
But then he began to find the work tedious and couldn't continue beyond a week.
""My father realised that housework was not just about work, it was also an imbalance in power. The power always stays with the breadwinner; no matter how well you cook, there are no accolades,"" she says.
She believes that women are expected and raised to accept this lower rung of power.
""When Indian men talk about what they like about their wives and mothers, it often has a lot to do with how much they have sacrificed for them or how much they take care of them or the home,"" Ms Srinivasan says.
India's Time Use Survey shows that social change is slow, and it may take time before women spend less on domestic work.
In the meantime, films like Mrs spark conversations around everyday questions many prefer to avoid - like, who's doing the dishes?",Asia

Reporting fromSingapore
Thanyarat Doksone
BBC News
Reporting fromBangkok","After years of wrangling with authorities, students in Thailand can now let their hair down. Literally.
On Wednesday, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court annulled a 50-year-old directive by the education ministry, which had previously set out rules on hairstyles for school students: short hair for boys and ear-length bobs for girls.
In practice, hairstyle rules have been gradually relaxed across many schools. But some still used the 1975 junta-issued directive as a guideline, and would cut the hair of students who didn't adhere.
The 1975 directive violated individual freedoms protected by the constitution and was out of touch with today's society, the court said.
The court decision this week came in response to a petition, filed by 23 public school students in 2020, which argued that the 1975 directive was unconstitutional.
Student activists have long campaigned for hairstyle rules to be relaxed, saying it infringes on their human dignity and personal freedom over their bodies.
One of them is Panthin Adulthananusak, who recently graduated from university.
""In the eyes of kids like us back then… even though it seemed impossible, we wanted to do something,"" he told the BBC. ""If no student in Thai history rose up to challenge the power of the adults that suppressed us, it would be a lifelong embarrassment.""
In response to such campaigns, the education ministry in 2020 allowed students to have longer hairstyles - but there remained some restrictions. Boys' hair could not cover the nape of their necks, while girls with long hair had to tie it up.
Those regulations were revoked in 2023, with then education minister Trinuch Thienthong announcing that students, parents and school authorities should negotiate their own common ground on what is acceptable for hairstyles in their schools.
But through all these changes, some schools continued to follow the standard laid out in the original 1975 directive.
Schools have traditionally associated short hair with discipline and tidiness - an argument that has been repeated by many social media users this week. But in recent years reports of schools banning bangs or dyed hair have sparked public outcry across Thailand.
In some parts of the country, teachers are known to shoddily cut students' hair during morning assembly to punish them for flouting hairstyle rules. Such practices have continued even as education authorities warned teachers against it.
In January, the Ministry of Education reiterated that it had repealed restrictions on hair length for all students, saying it recognised the ""importance of promoting diversity and fairness in all aspects of education"".
Wednesday's court decision, which also says that schools' hairstyle rules should consider the freedom and dignity of students, reaffirms the official push to leave hair choices up to students themselves.
But Panthin said the revoking of the decades-old directive ""still leaves a hole for schools to set their own rules"". In cases where schools have more conservative management, he suggested, restrictions could remain in place.
Nonetheless, Panthin said he ""felt glad that what I had seen and fought all along was acknowledged and there was a tangible progress"".
""I hope this court's ruling will set a new standard for the understanding about basic human rights at the school.""",Asia

BBC News
Reporting fromSingapore","Han Dong-Hoon was driving home from dinner in Seoul on December 3, scanning the radio, when he heard a breaking news update: President Yoon Suk-Yeol was preparing to deliver an emergency address.
Han, then the leader of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP), was widely seen as one of the presiden't closest allies. Yet that was Han's first hint that Yoon was about to do something unprecedented.
By midnight, the president had plunged the country into a political maelstrom, declaring martial law as part of a self-proclaimed bid to eliminate ""anti-state forces"" and North Korea sympathisers.
""When I first heard the news of martial law, I thought, 'We must stop it, because if it isn't lifted that very night, a bloodbath might occur,'"" Han tells BBC Korean.
""The fear and terror that South Korea's decades-long, hard-won achievements might suddenly collapse were overwhelming.""
Soon after Yoon's announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader hosted a live stream urging people to assemble in protest outside the National Assembly building in central Seoul.
Thousands responded, clashing with police and blocking military units as opposition lawmakers rushed into the assembly building, clambering over fences and walls in a desperate attempt to block Yoon's order.
Han was among them.
The late-night martial law edict seemed to have come from nowhere. It was, and remains, unclear who in Yoon's party supported or even knew of the move before it was made. But in the hours that followed, Han would help lead a successful attempt to overturn Yoon's order and have the declaration lifted.
Weeks later, he would also play a key role in impeaching the disgraced president – a move that would see him branded a ""traitor"" by mainstream members of the PPP, and ultimately lead to his resignation as party leader.
Han says he has ""no regrets"" about overturning Yoon's martial law attempt, insisting that he'd ""choose the same again"".
But in many people's eyes, his subsequent decision to impeach the very president he'd helped get elected was a surprising heel turn for someone formerly viewed as Yoon's right-hand man.
""We have experienced so much together over many years,"" Han says of his relationship with Yoon.
""I find the current situation extremely painful and regretful. Both the president and I worked in good faith for the betterment of our country – yet I must say that I deeply regret how things have turned out.""
For years, Han and Yoon were inseparable allies. Having both attended Seoul National University, the two forged a close bond as prosecutors while jointly investigating corruption in the country's halls of power.
Han gained political prominence when Yoon was narrowly elected president in May 2022, after beating his opponent by less than 1% of the vote.
Han was made Minister of Justice and later entrusted with the key role of Emergency Countermeasures Committee Chairman for the PPP, becoming the leader of the ruling party at the age of 50.
Yoon's time in office was beleaguered by scandals and political failures – not least of all his landslide loss to the opposition Democratic Party last April.
The result of those parliamentary elections was widely seen as a vote of no confidence against Yoon, and rendered him a lame-duck president.
For most of Yoon's administration, the PPP's conservative base was enthusiastic about Han. The lawyer-turned-politician had quickly emerged as a likely party candidate for the next presidential election, originally scheduled for 2027.
Now, as the increasing likelihood of a 2025 election looms amid the fallout of Yoon's ill-fated martial law attempt, Han's reputation is largely defined by the way he acted during and after that fateful night.
While some still see him as a fresh and promising political figure, many view him as having betrayed the very president who had furthered his career.
In the weeks following Yoon's abortive martial law order, the embattled president curried favour among PPP hardliners by refusing to cede political ground.
While he apologised for the events of December 3, he refused to resign, instead holing up in his official residence in defiance of calls for his impeachment.
He rallied his base and defended his decision by playing on unsubstantiated fears that the country was in danger.
It was these staunch Yoon loyalists who would come to turn against Han.
Despite having rejected Yoon's martial law declaration on December 3, Han initially opposed the impeachment motion put forth against the president by South Korea's political opposition – siding with almost every other PPP member in boycotting the first vote on December 7.
Days later, Han changed course. This was after allegations had emerged that during the martial law attempt Yoon had ordered key political figures – including Han – to be arrested. In allegiance with his close political aides, Han threw his full support behind a second and ultimately successful impeachment attempt, ousting Yoon as president.
""I wanted nothing more than for this government to succeed,"" Han tells the BBC, reflecting on the storm of condemnation that then followed from within his own party ranks.
""I initially sought an orderly early resignation plan for the president – a plan I earnestly pursued, but which ultimately failed,"" he adds.
""I am deeply pained by the outcome and empathise with those who remain unconvinced and heartbroken. Nonetheless, I believe it was a necessary decision for South Korea's continued progress and development.""
Yoon has been suspended from his presidential duties and is currently under investigation on insurrection charges. Han, meanwhile, stepped down as PPP leader in mid-December, maintaining that although Yoon's impeachment was painful, he did not regret his decision.
In the two months that followed, Han says he took some time to ""quietly reflect"" on whether he could have done more during such a turbulent period for South Korea.
""And I wrote a book,"" he adds: a memoir, titled ""The People Come First"", which chronicles the two weeks following Yoon's martial law declaration.
It's no surprise the book has become a bestseller: after all, it claims to be a first-hand account of events that have already gone down as some of the most dramatic in South Korea's political history. It hit shelves on 26 February, one day after the Constitutional Court held its final hearing on Yoon's impeachment trial.
It also hints at Han's future ambitions. Publishing a memoir is seen as a common first step in launching a political campaign in South Korea, and some believe ""The People Come First"" underscores Han's hopes to run as the PPP's presidential candidate, if the court impeaches Yoon and triggers a snap election.
Within the book's 384 pages, Han also discusses the need for constitutional reform and suggests that if he were to become president, he would change South Korea's five-year presidential term to four years.
Should he choose to run, the memoir serves to remind South Koreans where he stands on crucial issues - and that he is no longer an ally of a disgraced president.
As it stands, the odds look stacked against him. A recent poll found that Han's approval rating to become the next president sat at 6% – a fraction of the 22% rating he scored in January 2024. The decline of his political fortunes is compounded by the critics within the PPP, who accuse him of failing to protect both his former party and the president.
But Han plays down the suggestion that his memoir is intended as a political tool.
""I have published a book in which I truthfully express what I experienced and thought during these events,"" he tells the BBC. ""I am not returning with any specific political manoeuvre, but simply to share that message with you all.""
Another message Han seems eager to share is one of contrition towards the people of South Korea. He doesn't regret voting to impeach his president and former ally, he insists, but he does regret this.
""Yoon did impose martial law, and I believe that was a wrong act – one that does not align with the principles of liberal democracy,"" he says. ""As the leader of the ruling party that put that president in office, I want to express my deepest apologies to the people.""
""I am truly sorry that our actions, and the reactions we displayed, hurt the people. I think we must overcome and resolve this crisis.""",Asia

BBC News•@geetapandeybbc","It is often said that marriages are made in heaven.
But in India, where a majority of marriages are arranged, the process of match-making can feel like a passage through hell for a woman and her family.
That's the premise of Sthal: A Match, the 2023 gritty Marathi-language film that has won several prestigious awards at festivals in India and abroad. It is releasing for the first time in theatres in India on Friday.
Set in rural Maharashtra state, the film centres around Savita, a young woman striving for an education and a career in a patriarchal society, and the attempts by her father Daulatrao Wandhare - a poor cotton farmer - to find a good husband for his daughter.
""He wants a good price for his crop and a good match for his daughter,"" says director Jayant Digambar Somalkar.
The film is notable for the unflinching way it portrays what its lead actress calls the ""very humiliating"" experience of many young women, unlike other Indian movies about arranged marriage.
Sthal has also grabbed attention as its entire cast is made up of first-time actors chosen from the village where it is shot. Nandini Chikte, who plays Savita, has already won two awards for her brilliant performance.
The film opens with a sequence where Savita is interviewing a prospective groom.
Along with her female relatives and friends, she watches as the young man serves them drinks from a tray. They laugh when he, visibly nervous, fumbles during questioning.
Rudely awakened from what turned out to be a dream, Savita is told to get ready as a group of men are coming to see her.
In reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus.
The prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in.
Dressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators.
Questions come, thick and fast. What's your name? Full name? Mother's clan? Date of birth? Height? Education? Subject? Hobbies? Are you willing to work on the farm?
The men step out, to hold a discussion. ""She's a bit dark. She had makeup on her face, but did you not see her elbow? That is her real colour,"" says one. ""She's also short,"" he goes on to add. Others nod in agreement.
They leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision.
According to her parents, ""this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita"" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair.
The scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides.
Savita's protestations - ""I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career"" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman.
""Marriage is given far too much importance in our society,"" Chikte told the BBC. ""Parents believe that once the daughter is married, they will become free of their responsibility. It's time to change that narrative.""
She says she found it ""very humiliating"" that Savita was made to sit on a stool to be judged by all those men who discussed her skin colour, while there was no discussion about the prospective groom.
""I was only acting, but as the film progressed, I lived Savita's journey and I felt angry on her behalf. I felt insulted and disrespected.""
The film also tackles the social evil that is dowry - the practice of the bride's family gifting cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family.
Though it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings.
Parents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries.
In the film too, Daulatrao puts up a ""for sale"" sign on his land, even though farming is his only source of livelihood.
Director Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience.
Growing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home.
""As a child you don't question tradition,"" he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride.
""This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her.""
When he discussed the issue with his fiancée at the time - who is now his wife - she encouraged him to explore it in his work.
In a country where 90% of all marriages are still arranged by families, Sthal is not the first to tackle the subject on screen. IMDB has a list of nearly 30 films about arranged marriage made by Bollywood and regional film industries just in the past two decades.
More recently, the wildly popular Netflix show Indian Matchmaking focused entirely on the process of finding the perfect partner.
But, as Somalkar points out, ""weddings are hugely glamourised"" on screen.
""When we think of weddings in India, we think of the big fat wedding full of fun and glamour. We think of Hum Aapke Hain Koun,"" he says, referring to the 1990s Bollywood blockbuster that celebrates Indian wedding traditions.
""And the Netflix show only dealt with a certain class of people, the ones who are wealthy and educated and the women are able to exercise their choice.
""But the reality for a majority of Indians is very different and parents often have to go through hell to get their daughters married,"" he adds.
His reason for making Sthal, he says, is to ""jolt society and audiences out of complacency.
""I want to start a debate and encourage people to think about a process that objectifies women who have very little freedom to choose between marriage and career,"" he says.
""I know one book or one film doesn't change society overnight, but it can be a start.""

BBC News
Reporting fromSeoul and Singapore","Fifteen people in South Korea were injured, two of them seriously, after a pair of fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs in a civilian district on Thursday during a live-fire military exercise, local media reported.
The incident involving the Air Force KF-16 aircraft, in the city of Pocheon near North Korea, was part of routine drills held by the South to maintain combat readiness against potential attacks from the North.
South Korea's Air Force said that it was investigating the incident and apologised for the damage, adding it would provide compensation to those affected.
While shells from live firing exercises sometimes land near civilian residences, they rarely cause injuries.
According to local media reports, two people suffered fractures to their necks and shoulders.
A 60-year-old who was driving when the explosion happened had shrapnel lodged in their neck, Yonhap reported.
""I was driving when I heard a 'bang',"" they said. ""When I woke up, I was in an ambulance.""
""Our KF-16 (fighter jet) abnormally dropped eight shells of MK-82 bombs. It landed outside of firing range,"" said Korea's Air Force in a statement to the BBC.
The military said the pilot of one of the jets inputted the wrong coordinates by mistake, causing the bombs to drop in the civilian community.
Investigators have yet to determine why the second jet dropped its bombs, the military said, adding all live-fire exercises will be suspended.
One church building and houses were also damaged as a result of the incident.
Images published on local media show a broken window of a building and damaged roof of the church.
A local resident told Yonhap that he had been watching television at home when the explosion, which sounded ""like a thunderclap"", shook the house.
The director of a nearby senior citizen care centre said that the building's windows shattered and one of their teachers was taken to hospital with injuries. While no seniors were hurt, they said, ""they were so frightened that we sent them all home"".
Pocheon authorities told the BBC earlier on Thursday that residents had been evacuated while a bomb disposal team worked on safely disposing any unexploded bombs.
But authorities later said they did not find any unexploded bombs at the scene, Yonhap reported.
The defence ministry said the training on Thursday was related to a joint drill with US forces.
South Korea and the US are set to run combined drills from March 10 to March 20 - the first since US president Donald Trump's return to the White House. This comes at a time when the two countries are increasingly wary of the growing alliance between North Korea and Russia.
During another joint drill by South Korea and the US in 2022, troops fired a short-range ballistic missile which malfunctioned and crashed on a golf course in the military base. While the warhead did not explode, it still burst into flames and sent panic rippling across residents in the area.",Asia

Kelly Ng
BBC News","North Korea has stopped tourists from visiting, just weeks after the first Western tourists entered the country for the first time in five years.
North Korea sealed itself off at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, and started to scale back restrictions in the middle of 2023.
It opened up to Russian visitors in 2024, but it was only last month that Western tourists were allowed into the remote, eastern city Rason.
However several tour companies now say that trips to the reclusive country have been cancelled until further notice. Pyongyang has not given a reason for the sudden halt.
""Just received news from our Korean partners that Rason is closed to everyone. We will keep you posted,"" China-based KTG Tours, which specialises in North Korean tours, said Wednesday on Facebook.
Young Pioneer Tours and Koryo Tours were among the other agencies that have announced the suspension.
Those planning tours in April and May should refrain from booking flights ""until we have more information"", Young Pioneer Tours said in a Facebook post.
On 20 February, the first Western tourists started arriving in Rason, a city earmarked by the North as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies.
Tour operators told the BBC the visitors' movements were even more restricted than on pre-pandemic trips - they had fewer opportunities to wander the streets and talk to locals.
Phone signals and internet access were also not available in the hermit state.
One tour leader said he suspects Rason was picked because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.
Earlier this week, Koryo Tours said it was accepting international applications for the Pyongyang Marathon for the first time in five years. The event is scheduled for 6 April but it is now unclear if these can still be processed.
North Korea saw some 350,000 foreign tourists in 2019, of whom 90% were Chinese, according to media reports.",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqeg51y36o,Can Trump's tariffs break China's grip on manufacturing?,2025-03-05T22:47:04.050Z,"Joel Guinto
BBC News
Reporting fromSingapore","US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.
This is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes.
Trump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.
China's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (£788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).
It has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s.
So how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?
Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.
Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.
So, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.
Increasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.
Trump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.
Trump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US.
He also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.
Yes, analysts say.
Exports have been the ""saving grace"" of China's economy and if the taxes linger, exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC.
The sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus.
""The tariffs will hurt China,"" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. ""They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.""
That is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs.
Chinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.
While tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.
""Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,"" Ms Garcia-Herrero said.
China had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an ""early mover"" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.
Chinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.
""It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.""
China has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.
And it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.
China has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.
And yet, Trump's recent tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.
""Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,"" she said.
What concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips.
These restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.
It's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.
Although this could ""impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,"" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.
On the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will boost its high-value exports.
It happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.
""The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,"" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.
The government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.
A shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.
China already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world.
""The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,"" said Mr Cruise of Moody's.
But that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.
Analysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico.
Chinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other.",Asia

BBC South Asia correspondent, Dhaka","Bangladesh's interim leader says he felt ""dazzled"" when asked to take charge after long-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina was driven from power last year.
""I had no idea I'd be leading the government,"" Muhammad Yunus told the BBC. ""I had never run a government machine before and had to get the buttons right.
""Once that settled down, we started organising things,"" the Nobel-prize winning economist said, adding that restoring law and order and fixing the economy were priorities for the country.
It's unclear if Hasina, who fled into exile in India, and her party will participate in elections Yunus hopes to hold later this year. She is wanted in Bangladesh for alleged crimes against humanity.
""They [the Awami League] have to decide if they want to do it, I cannot decide for them,"" said Yunus in an interview with the BBC at his official residence in Dhaka.
""The election commission decides who participates in the election.""
He said: ""Peace and order is the most important thing, and the economy. It's a shattered economy, a devastated economy.
""It's as if there's been some terrible tornado for 16 years and we're trying to pick up the pieces.""
Sheikh Hasina was elected prime minister in 2009 and ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist. Members of her Awami League government ruthlessly cracked down on dissent. There were widespread allegations of human rights violations and the murder and jailing of political rivals while she was prime minister.
A student-led uprising forced Ms Hasina from office in August. At the behest of protesters, Yunus came back to Bangladesh to lead the new interim government.
He says he will hold elections between December 2025 and March 2026, depending on how quickly his government can institute reforms he believes necessary for free and fair elections.
""If reforms can be done as quickly as we wish, then December would be the time that we would hold elections. If you have a longer version of reforms, then we may need a few more months.""
""We are coming from complete disorder,"" he said, referring to the violent protests that engulfed Bangladesh last summer. ""People getting shot, killed.""
But almost seven months on, people in Dhaka say law and order has not yet been restored, and that things are not getting better.
""Better is a relative term,"" he said. ""If you are comparing it to the last year for example at the same time, it looks okay.
""What is happening right now, is no different than any other time.""
Yunus blames many of Bangladesh's current woes on the previous government.
""I am not supporting that these things should happen. I'm saying that, you have to consider, we are not an ideal country or an ideal city that suddenly we made. It's a continuum of the country that we inherited, a country that's been running for many, many years.""
Victims of Sheikh Hasina's brutal regime remain angry. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent months, demanding she be prosecuted for the deadly crackdown on student protesters.
A court in Bangladesh has issued a warrant for her arrest, but India has yet to respond.
Now, under Yunus's leadership, there are questions about the safety of those belonging to Sheikh Hasina's political party.
In February, several homes of Awami League members, including that of the founder of Bangladesh - Hasina's late father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - were vandalised and set on fire after her supporters were told she would give an address on YouTube.
In a post on social media, the Awami League accused the interim government of justifying violence.
When asked by the BBC about claims by members of the Awami League that Bangladesh is not safe for them, Yunus was quick to defend his government.
""There's a court, there's a law, there's a police station, they can go and complain, register their complaint,"" he said. ""You just don't go to a BBC correspondent to complain, you go to the police station to complain and see whether the law is taking its course.""
The Trump administration's decision to cut foreign aid and effectively end almost all programmes funded by the US Agency for International Development will have an impact on countries like Bangladesh.
""It is their decision,"" says Yunus.
""It's been helpful. Because they are doing things that we wanted to get done, like fighting corruption and things like that, which we couldn't afford right away.""
The United States is the third largest supplier of official development assistance to Bangladesh. Last year the US committed $450m in foreign aid.
When asked how it will make up the shortfall, Yunus says ""When it happens, we will make do.""",Asia

BBC News•@soutikBBC","Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds.
With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five.
But the tide has turned.
For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge.
India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third.
""For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,"" Mr Kumar says.
Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; £16,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. ""Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,"" he says.
His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution.
The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media ""finfluencers"" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike.
Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor.
When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market.
""I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!""
For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. ""I'm both ignorant and confident,"" he says with wry candour. ""Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype.""
Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. ""The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,"" he says.
In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. ""When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed.""
Mr Sircar lives in hope. ""My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green.""
There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic.
Hooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market.
""I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me,"" he says.
Ramesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in.
""This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic,"" says financial adviser Samir Doshi. ""Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next.""
Fuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets.
On the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. ""The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations,"" says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. ""Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?""
This market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses.
""In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings,"" noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst.
""Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances.""
Financial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. ""We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event.""
But clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs.
Foreign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite.
Mr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious.
In the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors.
""This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal,"" says Ms Halan. ""If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrdqp9y212o,Indian court orders release of Briton held without trial for years,2025-03-05T08:02:05.148Z,"Neyaz Farooquee
BBC News, Delhi","A British man detained in India for six years without trial over a high-profile corruption case must be released on bail, the Delhi High Court has ruled.
Christian James Michel, an arms consultant, is accused of bribing Indian officials to win a multimillion-dollar helicopter contract for British-Italian defence company AgustaWestland. He denies the charge.
He was extradited to India from the United Arab Emirates in 2018 and has been in custody ever since, in what a judge called an ""exceptional"" situation.
The AgustaWestland controversy was one of several corruption cases linked to India's former ruling Congress party, some of which fizzled out eventually.
In 2010 the Indian government signed a deal with AgustaWestland's parent company to purchase 12 helicopters.
The alleged irregularities came to light when India's federal auditor reported that the government may have vastly overpaid for the $753m (£455m) deal, which was eventually scrapped in 2014.
According to court documents, Mr Michel is alleged to have received around €42m ($44.7m, £25m) for securing the contract. His lawyer has argued that there is no evidence to connect him with the alleged offence.
India's financial crime fighting agency and domestic crime bureau have held separate investigations into Mr Michel.
But both of those investigations have yet to be concluded and trials have yet to begin, leading to a ""prolonged incarceration"" of Mr Michel, the Delhi High Court noted.
The judge said his six years in pre-trial custody was also ""alarmingly close"" to the maximum punishment of seven years' imprisonment for money laundering, which is one of the charges he faces.
The court decided to grant him bail in one of the cases, after the Supreme Court did the same in another case on 18 February.
This means that Mr Michel is now free to leave Delhi's high-security Tihar jail, but he cannot leave India as his passport has been seized.
The deal for 12 three-engine AW-101 helicopters was signed in February 2010 after AgustaWestland beat off competition from US and Russian rivals.
The aircraft were intended for an elite squadron of the Indian air force which ferries around the president, the prime minister and other VIPs.
Only three of the helicopters were delivered to India before the deal was scrapped.
Italian prosecutors suspected that kickbacks worth almost $67.6m were paid to Indian officials to secure the contract.
Giuseppe Orsi, the former chief of AgustaWestland's parent company which at the time was called Finmeccanica, and Bruno Spagnolini, the former head of AgustaWestland, were tried in Italy on fraud and corruption charges.
Both were acquitted in 2018. Indian officials have said their acquittals would have no bearing on the case in India.
India's air force chief at the time of the deal was arrested for bribery in 2016, and later released on bail.

BBC News, Delhi•@ArunodayM","After years of speculation, Tesla could finally be making its India debut.
The American electric vehicle (EV) giant has begun hiring for a dozen jobs in Delhi and Mumbai. It is also reportedly hunting for showrooms in both cities.
Asia's third largest economy offers an interesting growth opportunity for Tesla's futuristic cars as its global EV sales plummet and competition from Chinese manufacturers gets more intense.
But there's a million-dollar question - can Tesla compete in India's price-sensitive market?
Tata Motors currently holds pole position in India's EV market - with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India's JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. They are followed by Mahindra and Mahindra.
EVs made by these companies cost less than half of what consumers will have to shell out - around $40,000 (£31,637) - for just the base model of Tesla. It will, therefore, be seen as a luxury car, competing with higher-end EVs made by Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes.
Simply in volume terms, this will make India a tiny market for Tesla chief Elon Musk, unless the company introduces a low-cost model specifically for the country.
Besides price, India's road conditions could pose a challenge.
Tesla cars have very low ground clearance - or the distance between the lowest point of the car's undercarriage and the ground. This will make adapting to Indian roads difficult. To operate in the country, existing models may have to be re-engineered - which would drive up manufacturing costs.
Will Tesla do this just for one developing market where it could have only a small presence?
""It's been a challenge even with other global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) at the high end with small volumes. You can't justify these major engineering changes,"" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India magazine, told the BBC.
Also, amidst all the hype, it is easy to forget that EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India. Even critical ancillary infrastructure, like charging stations, have taken years to come up. While they have picked up pace, there are only around 25,000 charging stations across India.
In effect, Tesla will be jostling for space in a very small, albeit growing, EV market.
But at a policy level, India appears to be making every effort to woo the carmaker.
The country has outlined an ambitious national vision to go electric. It plans to have 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses and 80% of two and three-wheelers go electric by 2030. Most provincial governments have also established their own EV policies to incentivise demand and supply.
Subsidies offered by India on electric cars are also the highest among major economies, according to HSBC Securities. They amount to as much as 46% of the price of the country's top-selling electric car model.
It's no surprise then that passenger EV sales have grown astronomically by over 2,000% in less than five years - going from a low base of 4,700 annually to a 100,000 cars.
""The price difference between regular cars and EVs has reduced a lot, making customers rethink their choice,"" says Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.
In April last year, India also cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (£400m) and starting local production within three years.
Tesla and other imported electric vehicles costing over $35,000 (£27,550) can now enjoy a lower import duty of 15% on up to 8,000 vehicles. This came after Musk complained that high import duties had prevented the firm from launching its cars in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
""It's quite clever, as it forces a global player to localise - which is the way the game works: come and build in India,"" says Sorabjee.
The proposed policy could put Indian domestic carmakers at a disadvantage, however, given that the investment requirement for foreign players is ""not significant"" compared to Indian players in this segment, an HSBC research paper warns.
Import duty of 15% is also ""much lower"" than the tax on comparable combustion engine cars in India which also pay an additional road tax, according to HSBC.
Domestic EV players say having a ""level playing field"" is important, but appear unperturbed by Tesla's impending entry for now.
""We welcome competition,"" Rajesh Jejurikar, Mahindra and Mahindra's Executive Director and CEO, told the BBC. His company feels that more players will strengthen India's existing EV ecosystem and is working to improve the appeal of their offerings.
Critical issues like ""range anxiety"" - the worry whether an EV's battery charge will be enough to complete a journey - have been addressed through ""robust battery integration and rigorous real-world testing across diverse road conditions"", says Mr Jejurikar, adding that the brand is deploying cutting-edge technology into their product.
It will be hard to beat Tesla's edge in this area though, and coupled with sturdier batteries and a better user interface, it will certainly differentiate Tesla cars from others in the market, says Sorabjee.
What might also give Tesla tailwind is the rising share of premium vehicles in the Indian auto market. As a global brand with a perceived ""cool quotient"", owning a Tesla will be a status symbol for the young, aspirational Indian population.
But none of this - India's EV policy or the growing demand for premium cars among India's affluent - has yet led to a commitment from Tesla to put manufacturing dollars into an EV facility.
For now, it appears the carmaker will only ship units from its factories abroad.
When that changes will depend on a lot of things - how quickly India's affluent consumer base widens, and what tariff structures look like once India completes trade negotiations with the US.
President Donald Trump has already voiced displeasure over Tesla potentially building a factory in India to avoid high tariffs. In an interview with Fox News recently, he said that this would be ""unfair"" to the US.
Could Trump's 'America First' policy diminish Musk's appetite for starting manufacturing units in India then?
The question is moot, but for now it does look like India will first get glitzy Tesla showrooms for its rich, rather than job-creating Tesla factories for its under-employed masses.",Asia

BBC News","Japan has deployed more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the country's biggest forest fire in three decades.
At least one person has died in the blaze, which has torched more than 5,200 acres around the northern Japanese city of Ofunato since Thursday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA).
Although January to March is typically Ofunato's driest season, the area saw less rainfall last month than any February in more than 20 years - recording just 2.5 millimetres, compared to the usual average of 41.
About 4,600 people remain under government-issued evacuation orders as the fire continues to burn.
Some 2,000 have already left the area to stay with friends or relatives, and more than 1,200 have evacuated to shelters, officials said.
The fires are burning in a forest area of Iwate Prefecture, which is Japan's second largest prefecture and has the country's second-lowest population density.
More than 80 buildings are estimated to have been damaged so far, although FDMA noted that details are still being assessed.
""Although it is inevitable that the fire will spread to some extent, we will take all possible measures to ensure there will be no impact on people's homes,"" Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in parliament.
Thousands of firefighters from 14 prefectures, including Tokyo, have been dispatched to fight the fires. At least 16 helicopters are also being used, with images showing the aircraft dumping water onto the smouldering hills.
Like many other countries, Japan in 2024 recorded its hottest year since records began.
It is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened specific fires, because other factors - such as changes to the way land is used - are also relevant.
However, the IPCC says climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely.

BBC Hindi
Cherylann Mollan
BBC News, Mumbai","India's first medical clinic for transgender people has shut operations in three cities after US President Donald Trump stopped foreign aid to it.
Mitr (friend) Clinic, which was started in 2021 in the southern city of Hyderabad, offered HIV treatment, support and counselling services to thousands of transgender people.
Two more Mitr Clinics in Thane and Pune cities in western India, which were established the same year, have also shut down due to the aid cut.
In January, Trump signed an executive order pausing all foreign aid for 90 days, pending a review.
Trump has said he wants overseas spending to be closely aligned with his ""America First"" approach.
His crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid to foreign countries since the 1960s, has been seen as a step to this end.
The pausing of USAID funds has affected dozens of development programmes all around the world, especially in poor and developing countries.
In India, the shutting down of the Mitr Clinics has impacted the transgender community's access to crucial medical support.
The project came into existence under the US President's agency for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 when George Bush was president. John Hopkins University worked in collaboration with USAID and the Indian government to set it up.
A staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity to BBC Hindi said the three clinics catered to some 6,000 people and about 6% to 8% of the patients were being treated for HIV.
""All these cases were below 30 years of age. And 75% to 80% of this population was accessing health services for the first time,"" this staff member said.
In Hyderabad, the Mitr Clinic offered care to 150 to 200 transgender patients each month, many of whom suffered from HIV. The clinic had a small team of doctors, psychologists and technical staff.
""We were receiving 250,000 rupees ($2900; £2300) every month to provide services,"" Rachana Mudraboyina, a trans woman who was in-charge of the clinic, told BBC Hindi.
The news of the clinic's closure has come as a blow to the community.
Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli, a trans woman who has visited the clinic, told The Indian Express newspaper that she was ""devastated"" by the news as the clinic used to offer treatment at subsidised rates.
Another trans woman, who was hoping to use the clinic's services, told the Express that she was sad that she would no longer be able to do this.
India is estimated to have around two million transgender people, though activists say the number is higher. Despite a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that gives them the same rights as people of other genders, many still struggle to access education and healthcare due to stigma and discrimination.
There are state-run and private hospitals that offer medical help to the community, but many say they prefer going to Mitr Clinics because they find it more affordable and inclusive.
""Transgender people are not treated properly in general hospitals,"" Rachana says, explaining why the Mitr Clinics were so important for the community.
Trump's order freezing foreign aid has been criticised by many.
""USAID has made significant contributions in health and education and shutting it down is bound to have an impact on developing countries,"" Bubberjung Venkatesh, a lawyer, told BBC Hindi.
""It's a big blow. Its support for HIV prevention was significant,"" he added.
Last Thursday, the Trump administration said it was going to eliminate more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts. This means that very few projects will survive and the Mitr Clinics are unlikely to be among them.
Elon Musk, a close aide of Trump who also heads a government department in charge of slashing federal spending and jobs, has criticised funding projects for transgender people.
""That's what American tax dollars were funding,"" Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday in response to a post about the closure of the Mitr Clinics.
Meanwhile, staff at the clinic say they are looking for funding from other sources and hope that the state government will step in to help.
""We did a lot more than just provide medical help. The clinic also provided us a space to interact with the community, to share advice about various government schemes and health facilities,"" Rachana says.
""We want to continue [running the clinic] and are trying our best to find donors,"" she adds.",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j0gm2de77o,Dozens found alive in metal containers after India avalanche,2025-03-03T07:18:52.619Z,"Nikita Yadav
BBC News, Delhi","Dozens of construction workers have been pulled out alive from metal containers after they were buried by an avalanche in the Himalayas in India's Uttarakhand state.
They survived - some as long as nearly two days - as the containers in which they were living had enough oxygen to sustain them until rescuers could dig them out, Indian media reported quoting officials.
On Friday, 54 workers were buried when the avalanche hit a construction camp near Mana village. Eight were killed, while the other 46 were rescued.
The operation lasted almost 60 hours in sub-zero temperatures and concluded on Sunday.
Most of the labourers, who were working on a highway expansion project, were able to ""withstand the wrecking avalanche"" because of the containers, rescuers told The Indian Express newspaper.
""These metal shelters saved most of them. They had just enough oxygen to hold on until we got them out,"" a senior rescue official told The Times of India.
The newspaper reported that the force of the avalanche had hurled eight metal containers and a shed down the mountain.
Uttarakhand state Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has thanked rescue teams for their efforts in challenging conditions.
Members of the Indian army, national and state disaster response forces and local administration had worked to free the workers, using helicopters and drones for the operation.
Many of the rescued workers are receiving treatment at hospitals in the state's Joshimath town and Rishikesh city.
Satyaprakash Yadav, a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh who was among those rescued, said the ""avalanche hit our container like a landslide"", according to a video released by the army.
He added that the container he was in broke apart when the snow hit and it ended up near a river.
""We managed to get out on our own and reached a nearby army guest house, where we stayed overnight,"" he added.
Rajnish Kumar, a worker from Uttarkhand's Pithoragarh town, said most of them were sleeping when the avalanche struck.
""When the snow hit the container, it sank about 50 to 60 metres down [the mountain]. The Army arrived quickly and rescued us,"" he said, according to the army video.
Gaurav Kunwar, a former village council member of Mana, told the BBC on Friday the area where the avalanche hit was a ""migratory area"" and that it had no permanent residents.
""Only labourers working on border roads stay there in the winter,"" he said, adding that it had rained for two days prior to the avalanche.
The India Meteorological Department has warned of rainfall and snow in the northern states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as well as Jammu and Kashmir until Tuesday.
Avalanches and landslides are common in the higher regions of the Himalayas, especially during winter.
Experts say that climate change has made extreme weather more severe and less predictable. There has also been a rapid rise in deforestation and construction in Uttarakhand's hilly areas in recent years.
In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a piece of a Himalayan glacier fell into the river, triggering flash floods.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddyye3zplno,Ban on India's stock market 'She-Wolf' puts regulators on the spot,2025-03-03T02:42:13.376Z,"Archana Shukla
India Business Correspondent•@archanajsr","YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to ""make India trade"".
The wildly popular financial influencer called herself the ""She-Wolf of the stock market"" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.
Last month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.
The regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.
India's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.
Many of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled ""investment gurus"" or ""financial influencers"" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.
With only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.
Most operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.
The regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.
Sebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.
The regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.
Sebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.
As markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.
Thousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals.
Sebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (£10,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (£9m) by selling courses.
Ms Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.
While Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.
The regulator has been both a ""selective"" and ""reluctant regulator"", Sucheta Dalal, veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.
""It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big.""
Sumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.
""Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,"" he says.
Manish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.
""Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,"" Singh told the BBC.
Balancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal.
Technology is inherently disruptive and the law is always ""playing catch-up"". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.
""It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,"" says Mr Agrawal.
A Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations.
The challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl00ler0rno,Afghans hiding in Pakistan live in fear of forced deportation,2025-03-03T00:34:20.859Z,"Azadeh Moshiri and Usman Zahid
BBC News, Islamabad","""I'm scared,"" sobs Nabila.
The 10-year-old's life is limited to her one-bedroom home in Islamabad and the dirt road outside it. Since December she hasn't been to her local school, when it decided it would no longer accept Afghans without a valid Pakistani birth certificate. But even if she could go to classes, Nabila says she wouldn't.
""I was off sick one day, and I heard police came looking for Afghan children,"" she cries, as she tells us her friend's family were sent back to Afghanistan.
Nabila's not her real name - all the names of Afghans quoted in this article have been changed for their safety.
Pakistan's capital and the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi are witnessing a surge in deportations, arrests and detentions of Afghans, the UN says. It estimates that more than half of the three million Afghans in the country are undocumented.
Afghans describe a life of constant fear and near daily police raids on their homes.
Some told the BBC they feared being killed if they went back to Afghanistan. These include families on a US resettlement programme, that has been suspended by the Trump administration.
Pakistan is frustrated at how long relocation programmes are taking, says Philippa Candler, the UN Refugee Agency's representative in Islamabad. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) says 930 people were sent back to Afghanistan in the first half of February, double the figure two weeks earlier. At least 20% of those deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi had documentation from the UN Refugee Agency, meaning they were recognised as people in need of international protection.
But Pakistan is not a party to the Refugee Convention and has previously said it does not recognise Afghans living in the country as refugees. The government has said its policies are aimed at all illegal foreign nationals and a deadline for them to leave is looming. That date has fluctuated but is now set to 31 March for those without valid visas, and 30 June for those with resettlement letters.
Many Afghans are terrified amid the confusion. They also say the visa process can be difficult to navigate. Nabila's family believes they have only one option: to hide. Her father Hamid served in the Afghan military, before the Taliban takeover in 2021. He broke down in tears describing his sleepless nights.
""I have served my country and now I'm useless. That job has doomed me,"" he said.
His family are without visas, and are not on a resettlement list. They tell us their phone calls to the UN's refugee agency go unanswered.
The BBC has reached out to the agency for comment.
The Taliban government has previously told the BBC all Afghans should return because they could ""live in the country without any fear"". It claims these refugees are ""economic migrants"".
But a UN report in 2023 cast doubt on assurances from the Taliban government. It found hundreds of former government officials and armed forces members were allegedly killed despite a general amnesty.
The Taliban government's guarantees are of little reassurance to Nabila's family so they choose to run when authorities are nearby. Neighbours offer each other shelter, as they all try to avoid retuning to Afghanistan.
The UN counted 1,245 Afghans being arrested or detained in January across Pakistan, more than double the same period last year.
Nabila says Afghans shouldn't be forced out. ""Don't kick Afghans out of their homes - we're not here by choice, we are forced to be here.""
There is a feeling of sadness and loneliness in their home. ""I had a friend who was here and then was deported to Afghanistan,"" Nabila's mother Maryam says.
""She was like a sister, a mother. The day we were separated was a difficult day.""
I ask Nabila what she wants to do when she's older. ""Modelling,"" she says, giving me a serious look. Everyone in the room smiles. The tension thaws.
Her mother whispers to her there are plenty of other things she could be, an engineer or a lawyer. Nabila's dream of modelling is one she could never pursue under the Taliban government. With their restrictions on girls' education, her mother's suggestions would also prove impossible.
Pakistan has a long record of taking in Afghan refugees. But cross-border attacks have surged and stoked tension between the two neighbours. Pakistan blames them on militants based in Afghanistan, which the Taliban government denies. Since September 2023, the year Pakistan launched its ""Illegal Foreigners' Repatriation Plan,"" 836,238 individuals have now been returned to Afghanistan.
Amidst this current phase of deportations, some Afghans are being held in the Haji camp in Islamabad. Ahmad was in the final stages of the United States' resettlement programme. He tells us when President Donald Trump suspended it for review, he extinguished Ahmad's ""last hope"". The BBC has seen what appears to be his employment letter by a Western, Christian non-profit group in Afghanistan.
A few weeks ago, when he was out shopping, he received a call. His three-year-old daughter was on the line. ""My baby called, come baba police is here, police come to our door,"" he says. His wife's visa extension was still pending, and she was busy pleading with the police.
Ahmad ran home. ""I couldn't leave them behind."" He says he sat in a van and waited hours as police continued their raids. The wives and children of his neighbours continued trickling into the vehicle. Ahmad began receiving calls from their husbands, begging him to take care of them. They had already escaped into the woods.
His family was held for three days in ""unimaginable conditions"", says Ahmad, who claims they were only given one blanket per family, and one piece of bread per day, and that their phones were confiscated. The Pakistani government says it ensures ""no one is mistreated or harassed during the repatriation process"".
We attempt to visit inside Haji camp to verify Ahmad's account but are denied entry by authorities. The BBC approached the Pakistani government and the police for an interview or statement, but no one was made available.
Scared of being detained or deported, some families have chosen to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Others tell us they simply can't afford to.
One woman claims she was in the final stages of the US resettlement scheme and decided to move with her two daughters to Attock, 80km (50 miles) west of Islamabad. ""I can barely afford bread,"" she says.
The BBC has seen a document confirming she had an interview with the IOM in early January. She claims her family is still witnessing almost daily raids in her neighbourhood.
A spokesman for the US embassy in Islamabad has said it is in ""close communication"" with Pakistan's government ""on the status of Afghan nationals in the US resettlement pathways"".
Outside Haji camp's gates, a woman is waiting. She tells us she has a valid visa but her sister's has expired. Her sister is now being held inside the camp, along with her children. The officers would not let her visit her family, and she is terrified they will be deported. She begins weeping, ""If my country was safe, why would I come here to Pakistan? And even here we cannot live peacefully.""
She points to her own daughter who is sitting in their car. She was a singer in Afghanistan, where a law states women cannot be heard speaking outside their home, let alone singing. I turn to her daughter and ask if she still sings. She stares. ""No.""",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28n141209o,They lost their families in a plane crash - then came the online hate,2025-03-01T23:06:02.762Z,"Kelly Ng & Juna Moon
Reporting fromSingapore and Seoul","A plane crash in South Korea last December left Park Geun-woo an orphan. The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims.
The Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.
Police investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were ""thrilled"" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were ""fake victims"" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones.
Authorities have taken down at least 427 such posts.
But this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech.
Following Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation.
People whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech.
The tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; £231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high.
""People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard,"" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald.
In later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech.
Many South Koreans, he says, now ""view others not as their peers, but as adversaries"", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea.
""We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself,"" Prof Lim Myung-ho of Dankook University told the BBC. ""That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself.""
Mr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as ""parasites squandering the nation's money"".
By way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; £1,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund.
""It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted,"" said one such comment.
Mr Park says these comments were ""overwhelming"".
""Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?"" he says. ""Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money.""
""Too many people, instead of being sensitive, build their entertainment on others' suffering,"" he adds. ""When something like this happens, they belittle it and spew hateful remarks.""
Joshua Uyheng, a psychology professor in the Philippines who studies online hate, says that hate is often ""directed towards [those] we believe are gaining some advantage at our expense"".
""We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick.""
In the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse.
The accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country.
Many supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP.
""The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP,"" read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as ""100% the fault"" of the party.
Park Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and ""fake bereaved family member"". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out.
""It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair,"" she wrote on Threads two days after the incident.
Park Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to ""enjoy taking advantage of others' pain"".
""That's simply not something a human being should do,"" he told the BBC.
""I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death.""
While there are no perfect solutions to hate, experts say social media companies should establish policies on what constitutes hate speech and moderate content posted on their platforms accordingly.
""Online users should be able to report malicious posts and comments smoothly, and platform companies must actively delete such content,"" Prof Koo says. Law enforcement agencies should also take perpetrators to task, he adds.
Reminding people of their shared identities may also help, says Prof Uyheng.
""The less people feel that they are on opposite ends of a zero-sum game, perhaps the more they can feel that tragedies like these are the shared concern of us all - and that victims deserve empathy and compassion, not vitriol and condemnation.""",Asia

BBC News","At least four people have died and several others are missing after an avalanche hit the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, authorities have said.
A rescue operation has been under way after the avalanche swept away road construction workers in the village of Mana, which shares a border with Tibet, on Friday.
Some 50 people who were buried under snow and debris were rescued, but four died from their injuries, the Indian army said.
Helicopters have been deployed in the search for five people who are still unaccounted for in the Himalayan mountain state, it added.
Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said rescue teams were ""continuously engaged in relief efforts"" following the avalanche, which hit a Border Roads Organisation camp.
He added that the government was committed to providing all possible assistance to those affected ""in this hour of crisis"".
Footage posted on X on Friday by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police showed rescuers carrying people on stretchers and walking through several feet of snow - even as more snow continued to fall.

BBC News, Mumbai","Was it pruning or felling?
The alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.
The chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.
The trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.
But rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.
The Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics.
""We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,"" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.
The project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000–7,000 still left to be mapped.
Despite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.
This is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.
But on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.
The trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.
The Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected ""pleasure gardens"" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment.
The chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.
According to government literature, in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests.
Emperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.
Interestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.
But environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.
""Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,"" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.
""The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,"" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.
Chinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.
Government projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.
Last week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.
""The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,"" Mr Bhat says.
""Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.""",Asia

Seoul correspondent","Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.
These are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.
Then there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.
""The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,"" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.
North Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.
Since then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.
But after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.
Last Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.
Among them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.
Ben Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to ""being on a school trip"". ""You can't leave the hotel without the guides,"" he said.
""A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,"" said Mike. ""I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.""
Despite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. ""Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.""
On his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.
For now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the ""big-hitting monuments"" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.
Set up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.
Joe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. ""I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,"" he said.
Joe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.
""This was the only place people weren't expecting us,"" Joe said. ""It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.""
But according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.
Covid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. ""On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks."" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.
It is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.
Local guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.
Even Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. ""Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,"" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. ""It felt like they opened the doors just for us.""
The regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise ""the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed"". His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling ""his grandma's living room"". The whole window was cracked.
""They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there"", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.
One of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.
They knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. ""I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.""
Such conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.
Mike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. ""I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,"" he said.
""Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.""
For Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: ""North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.""
But tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.
""This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,"" she said.
One conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. ""I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,"" he said.",Asia

BBC News","At least six people have been killed in a suicide attack at an Islamic seminary in northern Pakistan that has been described as the ""University of Jihad"".
The blast happened at the mosque within the Darul Uloom Haqqania, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 55km (34 miles) from the northern city of Peshawar.
Maulana Hamid ul-Haq, a prominent cleric and the influential head of the school, is among the dead. Police said more than 10 other people had been injured.
The seminary has long been associated with the Taliban since several of its members, including the group's founder Mullah Omar, trained there.
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came ahead of the start of the holy month of Ramadan.
The explosion occurred after Friday prayers, according to local police.
Haq's son, Khuzaima Sami, told the BBC that hundreds were present in the main hall at the time of the blast and that he feared there would be many casualties.
An investigation has been launched into the attack.
""Initial reports suggest the blast occurred after Friday prayers as people were gathering to greet Hamid ul-Haq,"" Abdul Rasheed, the district police chief, told the AFP news agency.
The seminary - where clerics are taught - also known as a madrassa, is considered one of the region's most renowned religious educational institutions and is an important academic centre of the Deoband school of thought.
It has been referred to as the ""University of Jihad"" due to its notable alumni, including Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the militant Haqqani Network, and his son Sirajuddin Haqqani.
Both men played key roles in leading the Taliban's insurgency, first against Soviet forces and later against US and Nato forces, in Afghanistan.
Haq, 57, was the son of the influential Pakistani cleric Maulana Sami ul-Haq, widely known as the ""Father of the Taliban"".
He became the seminary's vice-chancellor after his father's assassination in 2018, and the head of a faction of the religious Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-S) political party.
He also served as a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 2002 to 2007.
Haq's father had longstanding ties with the Afghan Taliban's leadership, including Mullah Omar.
He was considered an influential figure in facilitating negotiations between the Taliban and the Pakistani government.
Despite their strong connections with the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, neither Haq nor his father were directly involved in any anti-state movements.
Instead, they were often seen as intermediaries between Pakistan and the Taliban.
Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attack, as did the Pakistani Taliban.
The group described Haq as a ""preacher of truth, a compassionate teacher, and a fearless advocate for the stability of madrassas"".",Asia

Officials said rescue operations were continuing in extreme weather amid heavy snowfall.
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami wrote on X that rescue work was being carried out by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the BRO and other teams.
Ambulances and emergency teams have been dispatched, but treacherous conditions continue to pose challenges for rescuers.
Footage posted on X by ITBP showed rescuers carrying people on stretchers and walking through several feet of snow - even as more snow continued to fall.

BBC News","A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police.
Police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space.
The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June, which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.
The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation.
On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.
During the three-hour long ""hugathon"", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.
But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face.
Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions.
She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him ""on his neck"" and ""the skin was very soft"".
The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts.
The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment.
Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other five - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.
K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.
But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by ""sasaeng fans"", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",Asia

BBC Hindi
Reporting fromDelhi","Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved.
A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges.
More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs.
The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was ""pre-planned"" as a part of a larger conspiracy to ""threaten India's unity"" by the people who were protesting against the law.
They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the ""main conspiracy case"". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin.
BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions.
More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions.
Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial.
In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows.
A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing ""predetermined chargesheets"" and ""falsely implicating"" the accused.
In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible.
Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out.
In two orders, the judge said that he could not ""restrain"" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the ""failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation"" would ""torment the sentinels of democracy"". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any ""real or effective investigation"".
The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a ""credible, fair and impartial"" way.
Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation.
Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots.
He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others.
Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson.
""Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van,"" he told the BBC.
When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting.
""They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims,"" Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries.
In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin.
In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been ""artificially prepared"", and that ""in all probabilities"" the shop was burnt by a ""mob of persons from the Hindu community"".
It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened.
Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed.
""All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy,"" said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father.
""In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence.""
He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. ""If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them,"" he added.
In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots.
The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client.
In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up.
In its order in January, the court ruled that the police ""manipulated"" the video to ""frame"" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the ""actual culprits"".
It also asked the commissioner of Delhi police to take appropriate action against the investigating officer in the case. The police did not respond to BBC Hindi's question on whether this had been done.
Mr Bhati, who spent four months in prison, refused to comment, saying he did not wish to discuss his ""ordeal"".
With so many acquittals, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said, the prosecution and police ""should sit down to introspect what they have achieved in five years"".
He also said that ""accountability needs to be fixed on the prosecution as well if the arrest is found to be illegal or unnecessary"".
""If the prosecution puts someone in jail because they have the power to do so or because they want to do so, they should not be allowed to get away with it if the incarceration is found to be illegal or unnecessary,"" he added.
Even as some cases fall apart in courts, many of those arrested are still languishing in jail awaiting a trial.
Gulfisha Fatima, a 33-year-old PhD aspirant, is among 12 activists who are still in jail on charges of being ""conspirators"" of the riots.
Her family said three other police cases were lodged against her and she got bail in all of them. But she continues to face incarceration in a fourth case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) - the stringent anti-terror law that sets exceptionally challenging conditions for bail.
""Since she's gone to jail, with every hearing we hope she will finally come out,"" her father Syed Tasneef Hussain told the BBC.
In Ms Fatima's case, after months of hearing the bail plea, the judge from the Delhi High Court got transferred in 2023, and now the entire case is being heard again.
""Sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to see her or if I'll die before that,"" Mr Hussain said.

Beijing and London","At least 40 Uyghurs have been deported to China,Thai authorities have confirmed, despite warnings from rights groups they could face possible torture and even death.
The group is thought to have been flown back to China's Xinjiang region on Thursday, after being held for 10 years in a Bangkok detention centre.
China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations.
It is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015.
The deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations.
Thai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Hours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported.
The Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past.
Eight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention.
The government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country.
She did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday.
""In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights,"" Shinawatra said.
Beijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs.
""The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice,"" the foreign ministry said.
Chinese state media said the group had been ""bewitched"" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country.
The returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang.
Many were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.
""What is the Thai government doing?"" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday.
""There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long.""
The detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody.
In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment.
""Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws,"" said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson.
""Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials.""
Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations ""totally destroyed"" the ""charade"" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one ""when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours"".
Amnesty International described the deportations as ""unimaginably cruel"".
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged ""all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China.""
He accused China of having ""committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang"" in a statement published online.
The UN said it ""deeply regrets"" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU.
Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees ""in the strongest terms"" with Thailand's decision.
There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).
The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.
Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.
China has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.

""We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,"" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens.
The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law.
The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action.
Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul.
From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored.
""In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police,"" says Zadran.
""They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering.""
Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime.
The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power.
However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.
The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask.
""On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,"" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction.
The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within.
The interior ministry says the cameras have ""significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders"". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures.
However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long.
Amnesty International say installing cameras ""under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces"".
By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes.
While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering.
Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is ""significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]"".
The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry – the Taliban's morality police - does not use it.
But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule.
""Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,"" she says.
""There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,"" she says.
Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used.
The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they ""are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge"".
The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment.
Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system.
In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home.
""They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,"" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; £54) a month.
The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power.
According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid.
""If families refused to pay [for the cameras], they were threatened with water and power cuts within three days,"" Shella adds. ""We had to take loans to cover the costs.
""People are starving - what good are these cameras to them?""
The Taliban say that if people do not want to contribute, they can put in an official complaint.
""Participation was voluntary, and donations were in the hundreds, not thousands,"" Khalid Zadran, the Taliban police spokesperson, insists.
Despite the assurances, rights campaigners both inside and outside Afghanistan continue to have concerns over how such a powerful surveillance system will be used.
Jaber, a vegetable seller in Kabul, says the cameras represent another way in which Afghans are made to feel powerless.
""We are treated like trash, denied the opportunity to earn a living, and the authorities regard us as worthless,"" he told the BBC.
""We can do nothing.""

BBC News
Reporting fromMae Sot, Thai-Myanmar border","""I swear to God I need help,"" said the man quietly on the other end of the line.
The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand.
They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.
But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.
The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people – more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.
The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.
He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.
Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.
Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.
""It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.""
Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.
Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.
China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.
Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.
He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.
""They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.""
Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.
He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.
The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.
It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.
That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.
The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.
Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.
Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.
A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.
The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.
The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.
Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.
Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.
""If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it – we must work seriously,"" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.
""Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,"" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.
""We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.""
Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.
But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.
Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave.
On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital.
""I just want to go home,"" he said over the phone. ""I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.""",Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj92g4n3v78o,'I scarred my six children by using skin-lightening creams',2025-03-24T00:28:41.653Z,"Madina Maishanu
BBC News, Kano","A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.
The 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.
Fatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.
Another was left with darker skin than before - with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.
Her toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.
""My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favours my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,"" Fatima says.
She says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.
At first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time.
But then the burns and scars appeared.
Skin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.
Women in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country - 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).
In Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.
The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.
Other ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.
Dermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.
The skin may become thinner, with the result that wounds take longer to heal, and are more likely to become infected, the WHO says.
The situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.
It is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.
""A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,"" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology spa in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.
She estimates that 80% of the women she has met have bleached their children, or plan to do so.
Some were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.
One of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.
However, smokers and drug users also sometimes have dark patches on their hands, due to the smoke.
So users of skin-lightening products are sometimes mistakenly assumed to belong to this group.
Fatima says that is what happened to her daughters, aged 16 and 14.
""They faced discrimination from society - they all point fingers at them and call them drug addicts. This has affected them a lot,"" she says.
They have both lost potential fiancés because men do not want to be associated with women who might be thought to take drugs.
I visited a popular market in Kano, where people who call themselves ""mixologists"" create skin-whitening creams from scratch.
The market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold.
Some pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.
I noticed that many bleaching creams, with labels saying they were for babies, contained regulated substances.
Other sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.
I also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.
One woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.
""Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,"" she said.
One seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies ""glow"", or to look ""radiant and shiny"".
Most seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.
One salesman said he used ""a lot of kojic"" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.
The approved dosage of kojic acid in creams in Nigeria is 1%, according to Nafdac.
I even saw salesmen giving women injections.
Dr Leonard Omokpariola, a director at Nafdac, says attempts are being made to educate people about the risks.
He also says markets are being raided, and there are efforts to seize skin-lightening ingredients at Nigeria's borders as they are brought into the country.
But he says it was sometimes hard for law-enforcement officials to identify these substances.
""Some of them are just being transported in unlabelled containers, so if you do not take them to the labs for evaluation, you can't tell what is inside.""
Fatima says her actions will haunt her forever, especially if her children's scars do not fade.
""When I confided in my mum about what I did, due to her behaviour, and when she heard the dangers of the cream and what stigma her grandchildren are facing, she was sad that they had to go through that and apologised,"" she says.
Fatima is determined to help other parents avoid making the same mistake.
""Even though I have stopped... the side-effects are still here, I beg other parents to use my situation as an example.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4k9v0vpv6o,South Africa envoy expelled from US 'has no regrets',2025-03-23T12:41:45.789Z,"Wedaeli Chibelushi
BBC News","The South African ambassador who was expelled from the US after a row with Donald Trump's government has said he has ""no regrets"".
Ebrahim Rasool arrived back home on Sunday and was welcomed by hundreds of raucous supporters at Cape Town International Airport.
Tensions between South Africa and the US have been on a downward spiral since Trump came into office in January.
Rasool, 62, was declared unwelcome in the US after Secretary of State Marco Rubio called him a ""race-baiting politician who hates America"". It followed a statement by the ambassador that Trump was ""mobilising a supremacism"" as the States' white population faced becoming a minority.
Rasool defended his comments on Sunday morning after touching down in Cape Town.
The remarks, made during a webinar organised by a South African think tank, were meant to ""alert"" South African intellectuals and political leaders ""to a change of the way we live, to a change of the way we are positioned in the United States, that the old way of doing business with the US was not a good one"", Rasool said.
While waiting for Rasool to arrive at the airport, members of the African National Congress, South African Communist Party and trade unionists sang and danced.
Some held placards reading ""Ebrahim Rasool, you have served our country with honour!!!""
Rasool's expulsion marked a rare move by the US - lower-ranking diplomats are sometimes expelled, but it is highly unusual for it to happen to a more senior official.
But ties with South Africa have been deteriorating for months.
In January, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law a bill allowing the state to seize land without compensation, provided it was in the ""public interest"".
The move followed years of calls for land reform, with activists and politicians seeking to redistribute farmland from the white minority.
In response to the law, Washington cut aid to South Africa. An executive order cited ""unjust racial discrimination"" against white Afrikaners - descendants of mainly Dutch settlers who first arrived in the 17th Century.
South Africa has strongly denied this claim.
On Sunday, Rasool lamented that he had not been able to challenge the Trump administration's views.
He was appointed as ambassador to the US just last year, because of his experience and extensive network of Washington contacts.
He had previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgy341v680o,Five key moments in the battle for Khartoum,2025-03-22T13:01:35.753Z,"Peter Mwai
BBC Verify","The Sudanese army has regained control of key areas of the capital, Khartoum, from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary faction seeking to overthrow the overthrow the UN-recognised government.
On Friday, jubilant army soldiers took photos of themselves in front of the battle-scarred entrance to the presidential palace in the heart of the city.
Fighting in Sudan broke out in April 2023, when the RSF launched attacks on Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) bases throughout Sudan, capturing significant territory, including key parts of the capital city and its airport.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict, millions have been forced from their homes and many have been left facing famine in what the UN has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
BBC Verify has been analysing videos and images posted during the conflict, frequently by fighters on both sides, to build a picture of the army's push to take back control of Khartoum.
The city is bounded by two great rivers, the Blue and White Nile, and the army's fight to regain control has been defined by these geographical constraints.
The offensive to retake the capital began in earnest on 26 September when the army launched air strikes against RSF-held areas in Khartoum.
Then in January, the beginning of the dry season saw fresh pushes by the army - bolstered by a new alliance with Islamists and ethnic militias - leading to a string of strategic victories.
We've identified video and photographs from key moments in the retaking of the city.
The army headquarters in central Khartoum had been encircled by RSF forces for 21 months, trapping soldiers unable to link up with other army units closing in on the city.
Then in late January, following military advances further north, the army was able to send reinforcements to break through RSF lines and end the siege.
Verified social media footage posted on 25 January shows soldiers celebrating in the grounds of the army HQ.
The following day, the army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, visited the army HQ saying his forces would ""eradicate"" the RSF and pursue them to the corners of the country.
Many RSF fighters attempted to withdraw across the White Nile River to safer areas on the western side as pressure mounted on their positions.
They found their escape route blocked following a reported air strike by the SAF on the main bridge across the river.
Footage posted on 6 February shows this crossing point at Jebel Awliya dam about 40 km south of Khartoum, blocked by badly damaged vehicles, with black smoke visible in the distance.
Satellite imagery from 5 February shows black smoke rising at the same location, indicating that the SAF attack itself occured at least a day earlier.
Army forces approaching Khartoum attempted to take control of the Manshiya Bridge, the last major crossing under RSF control.
On 3 March, the SAF posted drone footage from the battle for control of the bridge.
In it we can see the army targeting RSF vehicles and fighters trying to flee. A truck, carrying some men, and others running alongside, can be seen going up in flames as it is hit on the bridge.
Further drone footage shows more than a dozen men scampering through shrubs towards the bridge.
In the following days the army was able to hold its position at the bridge and to close in on the remaining RSF fighters trapped in the area.
BBC Verify has identified dramatic footage, posted on 16 March, of what appears to be an RSF fighter caught in an army ambush as they flee the SAF advance towards the city centre.
Along a tarmac street, a speeding motorcycle comes under a hail of bullets and suddenly flips over throwing off its rider.
The men firing - identifiable as belonging to the army from their uniform and yellow headbands - can be heard in the footage congratulating themselves following the attack.
By matching the buildings and the trees we see in the videos to satellite imagery, we have established the incident took place at a location about 2 km (1.2 miles) south of the presidential palace.
We've identified video of the army striking a convoy of vehicles travelling along al-Qasr Avenue, moving away from the presidential palace, posted online early on the morning of 20 March.
The footage shows a huge fire erupting, with multiple explosions and projectiles emerging from within the fire, suggesting the detonation of munitions being carried on the vehicles.
The video is accompanied by voices, speaking in Arabic, describing the attack on the RSF convoy vehicles containing weaponry.
We have managed to establish the location from two buildings seen in the footage which match buildings we see on Google Maps at a junction just over 1km from the presidential palace.
Just a few hours later, jubilant Sudan army soldiers posed for pictures in front of the palace building, their arms raised in victory.
The RSF still hold control over significant parts of the city as well as large areas of western Sudan. But the taking of the palace by the army is hugely symbolic moment in the conflict.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8ln5g12wo,Namibia swears in first female president,2025-03-21T12:49:52.679Z,,"Namibia's new president was sworn in on Friday to lead a country facing high rates of unemployment, inequality and poverty.
And she will be dealing with it with the additional burden of being only Africa's second-ever directly elected female president and Namibia's first female head of state.
""If things go well then it will be seen as a good example,"" Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told BBC's Africa Daily podcast. ""But if anything then happens, like it can happen in any administration under men, there are also those who would rather say: 'Look at women!'""
The 72-year-old won November's election with a 58% share of the vote.
Nandi-Ndaitwah has been a long-term loyalist of the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) – which has been in power since the country gained independence in 1990 after a long struggle against apartheid South Africa.
She joined Swapo, then a liberation movement resisting South Africa's white-minority rule, when she was only 14.
While the party has made changes and improved the lives of the black majority, the legacy of apartheid can still be seen in patterns of wealth and land ownership.
""Truly, land is a serious problem in this country,"" she told the BBC ahead of the inauguration.
""We still have some white citizens and more particularly the absent land owners who are occupying the land.""
She adds that she is committed to the ""willing-buyer, willing-seller"" principle, which means no-one is forced to sell up.
Namibia is a geographically large country with a small population of three million.
Government statistics show that white farmers own about 70% of the country's farmland. A total of 53,773 Namibians identified as white in the 2023 census, representing 1.8% of the country's population.
Namibia is one of the world's most unequal countries, with a Gini coefficient of 59.1 in 2015, according to the World Bank, which projects poverty is expected to remain high at 17.2% in 2024.
The unemployment rate rose to 36.9% in 2023 from 33.4% in 2018, according to the country's statistics agency.
Nandi-Ndaitwah said the economy, which partly relies on mineral exports, should work more on adding value to what the country extracts from the ground rather than exporting raw materials.
She also wants Namibia to focus more on creative industries and get the education sector to adjust to new economic realities.
Nandi-Ndaitwah is only the second African woman to be directly elected as president, after Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.
The continent's only other female president at the moment is Tanzania's Samia Suluhu Hassan, who took up the role after her predecessor died in office in 2021.
Nandi-Ndaitwah wants to be judged on her merits, but she said that it was a ""good thing that we as countries are realising that just as men [can do], women can also hold the position of authority"".

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg8enx9j8no,Faith comes before football - Ouattara,2025-03-24T08:26:57.156Z,,"Dango Ouattara prays before and after every game he plays, in addition to his five regular daily prayers
""For me, faith comes first. It comes before football.""
As Ramadan draws to a close, Bournemouth's Dango Ouattara is clear where his priorities lie.
The forward from Burkina Faso is a devout Muslim who prays five times a day, as well as before and after each game he plays, saying it helps him to ""stay humble"".
""It allows us to refocus on ourselves, to see what we've done well and what we haven't been able to do well,"" the 23-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa when we meet at his local mosque in Poole.
""It also allows us to correct ourselves in society too. It allows us to stay on the right path.""
During our conversation, Ouattara regularly uses words such as ""calm"" and ""stable"" to describe the benefits of Islam.
A quiet and thoughtful character, verging on shy, there is nothing bling about him. He arrives early for our interview, dressed head-to-toe in white, asking to pray before we settle down to chat.
""Faith allows me to overcome many challenges, to respect others, to respect choices and religions too,"" he explains.
""Whether it's on the pitch, off it with friends or even with my family, it allows me to be calm in my daily life.
""You have to believe before you can do something.""
'Fans are living through Bournemouth's best period - enjoy the ride'
Bournemouth's Semenyo motivated by trial rejections
This season, Ouattara seems full of belief in his own abilities.
Despite not being a consistent starter, he has nine goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for the Cherries, including a hat-trick against Nottingham Forest in January.
Those numbers are a vast improvement on last season, when he only scored once.
With Andoni Iraola's side potentially challenging for European football, Ouattara says the team is ""great fun"" to play in.
""The secret this year is that we've had the same squad, virtually the same players and the same coach. It's important to have a group that continues to develop together,"" he added.
""You can see every time that the players enjoy it.
""We're going to do everything we can to go further.""
Born in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, Ouattara himself has been on a journey, having arrived on England's south coast via French side Lorient.
Signed for £20m ($26m), when he made his debut in January 2023 he became only the second Burkinabe to appear in the Premier League, following on from his national team captain and former Aston Villa forward Bertrand Traore.
Still uncomfortable speaking in English for prolonged periods, he confirms language was the main problem when he arrived, but says religion played its part there too.
""My agent and I were able to find the mosque, so I started to get back into my routine,"" he explains.
""And as I came to the mosque, everything went well for me with the football. So I found myself back in the environment I'd left behind in Lorient.
""It helps because when you find yourself in another town, having the community shows that you're not alone. You have the opportunity to pray with other people, to meet new people.
""It keeps us focused on religion.""
Ouattara tries to visit his local mosque in Poole as often as his training schedule allows
This year, Ramadan began on Friday 28 February and will finish on Sunday 30 March.
The month is considered holy as Muslims believe it marks when the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.
For adherents, fasting plays a key role, foregoing food and drink between sunrise and sunset.
""I wouldn't say that Ramadan is difficult, it's more mental, because personally I'm used to doing it,"" says Ouattara.
""It's more the lack of water. And given that you have to wake up at unusual times to eat, that's more tiring.""
But he has a cunning plan to combat the fatigue: naps.
""I wake up at 4.30am, I do my ablutions and I've already got the food which has already been prepared by the club chef.
""I eat, and after prayers I have time to go back to bed for an hour or so before training.
""Then after the sessions I say my prayers and sleep for another hour. So the fact that I rest each time means I recover better.""

Despite his fast, and when he is not napping, Ouattara's training plan remains pretty much the same.
""It's even easier when you have the support of the whole team, whether it's the players or the staff,"" he said.
""Everyone asks me 'How are you feeling? Is it going well? Is it not too difficult?'
""They understand me and they encourage me.""
Although he is the only Muslim in Bournemouth's squad, Ouattara is far from alone as a Premier League player fasting during Ramadan.
Indeed, the month has become so high profile that in 2021 the league introduced a new agreement that allows officials to call a halt to games in progress at sunset to allow players to break their fast.
It is something for which Ouattara is grateful.
""The initiative of the Premier League is to be congratulated because it's not easy to play while fasting,"" he added.
""We hope that it will continue.""
Dango Ouattara is someone who hears the call to prayer strongly, something that has helped turn him into a player Bournemouth fans can have faith in.

BBC News, Nairobi","Six police personnel in north-east Kenya have been killed after assailants attacked a base near the border with Somalia, a regional official said.
No group has claimed responsibility, but Garissa County Commissioner Mohamed Mwabudzo told the BBC the style of the attack followed a pattern of raids by Somali-based Islamist militant group al-Shabab.
He said the officers were ambushed on Sunday at 05:30 local time (02:30 GMT), while they were preparing for their morning prayers.
In addition to the six officers who died, four officers were taken to hospital with injuries.
Al-Shabab frequently mounts cross-border attacks in the area, targeting both the Kenyan military and civilian populations.
Mr Mwabudzo said the ""guerrilla-style"" nature of the attack aligns with al-Shabab's ""pattern of cross-border raids aimed at destabilising the region"".
""The suspected militia used assorted weapons to overrun the camp,"" he added.
The camp targeted in the assault was housing reservists - local volunteers who assist the regular police in securing remote areas.
Al-Shabab - affiliated to al-Qaeda - controls large parts of southern and central Somalia.
The group has waged a brutal insurgency against Somalia's government for nearly 20 years.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1p5ek72vo,Are Nigerians abroad widening the class divide back home?,2025-03-23T02:21:11.613Z,"Danai Nesta Kupemba
BBC News","Scenes playing out in Nigeria during holiday periods could be in a movie: emotional reunions at airport terminals, champagne flowing like water in high-end clubs and A-list Afrobeats performers dominating stages to packed audiences nationwide.
This is when Nigerians abroad return for a visit to the home country. They are nicknamed I Just Got Back (IJGB) and bring with them more than full suitcases.
Their Western accents dip in and out of Pidgin, their wallets are boosted by the exchange rate, and their presence fuels the economy.
But it also highlights an uncomfortable truth.
Those who live in Nigeria, earning in the local naira currency, feel shut out of their own cities, especially in the economic hub of Lagos and the capital, Abuja, as prices go up during festive periods.
Residents say this is particularly the case for ""Detty December"", a term used to refer the celebrations around Christmas and New Year.
Detty December makes Lagos almost unliveable for locals - traffic is horrible, prices inflate and businesses stop prioritising their regular customers, a radio presenter based in Lagos tells the BBC.
The popular media personality asked not to be named for voicing what some might consider controversial opinions.
But he is not the only one to hold these views and has some are pondering, with Easter and the diaspora summer holiday season approaching, whether the IJGBs are helping bridge Nigeria's class divide or are making it even wider.
""Nigeria is very classist. Ironically, we're a poor country, so it's a bit silly,"" the radio presenter adds.
""The wealth gap is massive. It's almost like we're worlds apart.""
It is true that despite oil-rich Nigeria being one of Africa's biggest economies and the continent's most populous country, its more than 230 million citizens face huge challenges and limited opportunities.
At the beginning of the year, the charity Oxfam warned the wealth gap in Nigeria was reaching a ""crisis level"".
Statistics from 2023 are startling.
According to the World Inequality Database more than 10% of the population owned more than 60% of Nigeria's wealth. For those with jobs, 10% of the population took home 42% of the income.
The World Bank says the figure of those living below the poverty line is 87 million - ""the world's second-largest poor population after India"".
Martins Ifeanacho, professor of sociology at the University of Port Harcourt, says this gap and resulting class divide has grown since Nigeria's independence from the UK in 1960.
""We've gone through so much economic hardship,"" the academic, who returned to Nigeria after studying in Ireland in the 1990s, tells the BBC.
He points the finger at the greed of those who are in position of political power - be it at a federal or state level.
""We have a political elite that bases its calculations on how to acquire power, amass wealth for the purpose of capturing more power.
""The ordinary people are left out of the equation, and that's why there is a lot of hardship.""
But it is not just about money in the bank account.
Wealth, real or perceived, can dictate access, status and opportunity - and the presence of the diaspora can magnify the class divide.
""Nigeria's class system is hard to pinpoint. It's not just about money, it's about perception,"" explains the radio presenter.
He gives the example of going out for a meal in Lagos and how peacocking is so important.
At restaurants, those arriving in a Range Rover are quickly attended to, while those in a Kia may be ignored, says the radio presenter.
Social mobility is difficult when the nation's wealth remains within a small elite.
With odds stacked against those trying to climb the ladder, for many Nigerians the only realistic path to a better life is to leave.
The World Bank blames ""weak job creation and entrepreneurial prospects"" that stifle the absorption of ""the 3.5 million Nigerians entering the labour force every year"".
""Many workers choose to emigrate in search of better opportunities,"" it says.
Since the 1980s, middle-class Nigerians have sought opportunities abroad, but in recent years, the urgency has intensified, especially among Gen Z and millennials.
This mass exodus has been dubbed ""japa"", a Yoruba word meaning ""to escape"".
A 2022 survey found that at least 70% of young Nigerians would relocate if they could.
But for many, leaving is not simple. Studying abroad, the most common route, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, not including travel, accommodation and visa expenses.
""Japa creates this aspirational culture where people now want to leave the country,"" says Lulu Okwara, a 28-year-old recruitment officer.
She went the UK to study finance in 2021 - and is one of the IJGBs, having returned to Nigeria at least three times since moving.
Ms Okwara notes that in Nigeria there is a pressure to succeed. A culture where achievement is expected.
""It's success or nothing,"" she tells the BBC. ""There is no room for failure.""
This deeply embedded sentiment makes people feel they must do anything to succeed.
Especially for those who come from more working-class backgrounds. The IJGBs have a point to prove.
""When people go out there, their dream is always to come back as heroes, mostly during Christmas or other festivities,"" says Prof Ifeanacho.
""You come back home and you mix with your people that you've missed for a long time.
""The type of welcome they will give to you, the children that will be running to you, is something that you love and cherish.""
Success is chased at any cost and putting on a foreign accent can help you climb Nigeria's social ladder - even if you have not been abroad.
""People fake accents to get access. The more you sound British, the higher your social status,"" says Prof Ifeanacho.
He recalls a story about a pastor who preached every Sunday on the radio.
""When they told me that this man had not left Nigeria, I said, 'No, that's not possible.' Because when you hear him speak, everything is American,"" he says in disbelief.
American and British accents, especially, act as a different kind of currency, smoothing paths in both professional and social settings.
Pushback on social media suggests some IJGBs are all front - they may lap up the returning hero adulation but in fact lack financial clout.
Bizzle Osikoya, the owner at The Plug Entertainment, a business that hosts live music events in West Africa, says he has encountered some issues that reflect this.
He tells the BBC about how several IJGBs have attended his events - but who have gone on to try and get their money back.
""They went back to the US and Canada and put a dispute on their payments,"" he says.
This may reflect the desperate effort to maintain a façade of success in a society where every display of wealth is scrutinised.
In Nigeria, it seems, performance is key - and the IJGBs who are able to show off will certainly be able to climb the class ladder.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y06pygdj7o,Will recapture of presidential palace change course of Sudan war?,2025-03-21T22:22:54.118Z,"Barbara Plett Usher
BBC News
Reporting fromPort Sudan","The scenes of jubilant soldiers in Khartoum mark a significant advance in an offensive that has seen Sudan's army seize back swathes of territory in recent months.
The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) lost control of the capital early in the war and have been fighting for two years to recapture it from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Now they have retaken the presidential palace and believe they are on course to win back the rest of the capital. But they are a long way from winning the war.
The complex, which includes the historic Republican Palace, is a symbol of power and sovereignty, important for the military-led government and its narrative as legitimate rulers fighting a ""terrorist militia.""
This is also a strategic victory.
After clearing outer districts of greater Khartoum, the army has taken much of the city centre, pushing the RSF fighters out of key sites like government buildings and away from the military's General Headquarters, according to an army spokesman.
This means the RSF has in effect lost its control of the capital, even though its fighters are still present in Khartoum.
But it is not clear how far the frontline has moved. RSF fighters are still scattered around the city centre and stationed in part of the airport. They also occupy territory to the south of the palace.
Bloody fighting is expected to continue as the army tries to corner remaining RSF units. The paramilitary force has already shown it can strike back despite its weakened position, launching a drone attack at the palace that killed a number of Sudanese journalists and army officers.
A full army victory in the capital could reset the direction of the war or harden the territorial division that divides the country between the two foes.
The RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, controls most of the Darfur region in western Sudan, and parts of the south.
The military-backed government, led by army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, controls eastern and northern Sudan.
The two men worked together, and carried out a coup together, before a power struggle between them exploded into civil war in April 2023.
Full control of Khartoum could help the army complete its takeover of central Sudan, where it has wrested back territory from the RSF in recent months.
It may also create momentum for the SAF to challenge General Hemedti in his stronghold of Darfur, especially over the city of El Fasher, which has been under RSF siege for nearly a year.
But many observers believe there is a danger that Sudan will drift into de-facto partition, with the two warring parties and their backers entrenching themselves in their zones of influence.
The RSF is working to set up a parallel government in areas it controls, gathering allied groups to sign a political charter and constitution last month in Nairobi.
Its intention was to show that despite battlefield setbacks, it remains a potent force - and that its desire to take control of the country remains undimmed.
Sudan's people have borne the brunt of this brutal civil war, which has inflicted massive death, destruction, and human rights violations on civilians.
The United Nations has described the situation in the country as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. More than 12 million people have been forced to flee their homes and millions face acute food shortages, with parts of the country driven into famine.
Khartoum is one of the places expected to reach famine conditions soon, having been subject to widespread looting from RSF soldiers and restrictions on aid by the Sudanese government. So a change of power in the city could make a big difference to humanitarian conditions there.
But for most of the people of Sudan it means that for now little is likely to change.
Both sides have been accused of obstructing emergency aid, in effect using it as a weapon of war, according to UN officials. And both have been accused of war crimes, although critics have singled out the RSF for charges of mass rape and genocide.
The army will be hoping that reclaiming the Presidential Palace proves to be a staging post for a broader ultimate military victory.
But although the SAF have momentum, it is unlikely that either party can achieve a victory which allows them to govern the whole of Sudan, the International Crisis Group said in a recent report.
Still, both sides have vowed to continue fighting for the remainder of the country, and efforts to revive peace talks so far have failed.",Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx293dxpp1no,The gravedigger 'too busy to sleep' as Khartoum fighting rages,2025-03-21T06:52:31.733Z,"Barbara Plett Usher
BBC News, Khartoum","After retaking the presidential palace Sudan's army appears poised to regain control of the capital, Khartoum, two years after it was ousted from the city. As the soldiers were preparing to launch the latest offensive the BBC was given rare access to the operation.
Sudan's people continue to bear the brunt of the war, which has inflicted massive death, destruction and human rights violations on civilians, and driven parts of the country into famine.
In recent months troops had recaptured northern and eastern districts of the capital, and pockets of central Khartoum.
The latest offensive to expand that foothold began a week ago.
We were taken to a rallying point in Khartoum North in the middle of the night.
Troops were in high spirits, singing chanting and whooping as they built momentum for the battle.
By morning the army had advanced. By evening of the next day, it had broken through a key central zone held by the RSF, allowing troops in the south-west of the city to join forces with the military headquarters to the north.
On Thursday the army destroyed an RSF convoy trying to withdraw south from the presidential palace, according to reports.
Footage apparently released by the military showed drones targeting vehicles, and a massive fire, possibly caused by the explosion of ammunition transported by the RSF fighters.
The strategically located Republican Palace complex is the official residence of the president and has historical and symbolic significance in Sudan.
By Friday morning, the army had captured the palace, though the RSF said they were fighting back.
One person undoubtedly cheering on the troops is Abidin Durma, well-known as the gravedigger of Omdurman, a sister city to Khartoum over the River Nile that is part of the capital region.
He is clearly a strong patriot, regularly referring to what he calls ""the war of dignity"".
But he also experiences daily its high cost for civilians.
Mr Durma's ancestors were related to the Mahdi, a 19th Century leader who created the foundations of the Sudanese state and an influential religious movement.
They established the Ahmed Sharfi Cemetery, one of the oldest and biggest in Omdurman.
Now the graveyard Mr Durma has tended for decades paints a vivid picture of the scale of death.
It has expanded on three sides by roughly 10 acres (four hectares), with row after row of brown earth mounds, some marked, some not.
The smell of death lingers in the air above them.
Mr Durma tells me that he and young volunteers bury ""not less than 25, 30 or 50 bodies per day"".
That is partly because other cemeteries became unsafe during active fighting in Omdurman, the city is crowded with displaced people, and the health system has been overwhelmed by conflict.
But artillery fire has claimed a large number of lives.
Mr Durma showed me a mass grave for victims of a strike on a school.
One entire section of fresh graves holds bodies of those killed in the shelling of a main market in January: at least 120 people died.
We are told the RSF is responsible, firing into army-controlled areas of Omdurman. But both sides are condemned for war crimes - the military is accused of mass killings elsewhere.
Bodies come straight from the hospital, which calls the grave digger to let him know he needs to prepare for burial. The process is efficient, and fast.
""We bury them right away, because there is no [reliable] fridge,"" Mr Durma says.
""The graveyard is safe. The graves are ready. The bricks are ready. The people who bury are ready, inside the graveyard.""
""There is no time to sleep until the last body is buried,"" he adds, ""and then I sleep for half an hour or 15 minutes, until I get another call. I come back like now, and three, four bodies arrived.
""People die from bullets, from shelling. People are killed sitting in their homes. There is so much death.""
His phone rings again. Another body is ready for burial.
Prayers for the dead have become a regular ritual in al-Mabrouka, a neighbourhood in the western al-Thawra district of Omdurman that is in the line of fire between the army and the RSF.
A group of friends gather around Abazar Abdel Habib at the local mosque to offer condolences, lifting their hands as they recite verses from the Quran.
We had met Mr Abdel Habib at the hospital morgue the previous day, where he was picking up the bodies of his brother and sister-in-law. They had been struck by artillery fire while taking their son to pre-school.
At the family home, a little girl, Omnia, woke up crying, in pain.
She was in her mother's arms when the shell hit, and escaped with only a foot injury. Her survival is seen as a miracle.
She has been orphaned along with three brothers.
""We'll tell them exactly what happened, about the shelling and the war,"" says Mr Abdel Habib, cradling Omnia.
""They are the generation of the future, we will not allow this to affect them in the future. We will try to make up to them the affection of their mother and father, even though it's hard. But this is destiny.""
I joined women from the community who had crowded into a nearby room to mourn the dead, as they have done many times during this war.
Three other people were killed in the shelling that same day, including two young boys.
Nothing like normal life is possible, they told me.
""We hide under the beds when the shelling starts,"" says Ilham Abdel Rahman, when I asked her how she protects her children.
""One hit our home and killed the neighbour's girl at the steps of our door.""
Hawa Ahmed Saleh says if there is shelling early in the morning ""we go to the market after that to buy food"".
""If it doesn't happen, we're forced to sit and wait until the shelling comes, and after it stops, people will go and gather what they need for living.
""The children are always in a state of terror,"" she adds.
""Daily we are losing our children. The students cannot settle, there is no studying. There is always a state of fear, we are always in a state of sadness.""
If the army does regain full control of the capital, at least here the shelling will stop.
But the war will continue elsewhere in the country, and its wounds will haunt Sudan for years to come.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cgm1kvkner0o,Groundbreaking but controversial - new IOC president Coventry,2025-03-21T09:40:39.685Z,,"IOC presidency is a 'dream' - Coventry
Kirsty Coventry will become the first woman to hold the most powerful role in sport, having been elected the 10th International Olympic Committee (IOC) president at a meeting in Greece.
The Zimbabwean sports minister and double Olympic swimming champion is also the first African and, at the age of 41, the youngest person to take up the position. But her victory is controversial as well as groundbreaking.
BBC Sport looks at why.
Despite predictions of a close race between the seven candidates and expectations of multiple rounds of voting, Coventry secured an overall majority of the secret ballot after just one round, winning 49 votes out of a possible 97.
Despite being widely seen as the pre-vote favourite, Spanish rival Juan Antonio Samaranch Jnr trailed behind with 28 votes.
Lord Coe meanwhile - the highest profile candidate with a CV that boasts overseeing London 2012 and running World Athletics - could only muster a meagre eight votes.
Before the vote he and his team had seemed confident that he could secure the job he said he had been in training all his life for. Had they been naive, or had some members told them one thing and done another?
A year after Paris 2024 set a milestone as the first Olympics to achieve full gender parity, Coventry's triumph sends a powerful message.
Up until 1981 there were no female members of the IOC and Coventry is only the second woman to run for the presidency.
Her background and relative youth also helps the IOC project a progressive and diverse image at a time when it is trying to ensure the Games remain relevant to younger generations.
As well as being a seven-time Olympic medallist and competing at five Games, Coventry has been an IOC member since 2013, where she has held a number of significant roles.
But the nature of her victory - despite a low-key campaign - has led to questions over how it was achieved.
IOC insiders that BBC Sport spoke to at the luxury resort of Costa Navarino in Greece, where Thursday's vote took place, all said that Coventry was the preferred candidate of outgoing president Thomas Bach.
The German denied suggestions that he had been directly lobbying on her behalf, and insisted that the process had been fair.
On Friday, he said he was ""very much relieved"" to see the result of the vote, calling it ""a demonstration of the IOC as a global organisation with the highest good governance standards"".
Whatever the reality, Coventry's success has been widely portrayed as a win for continuity and patronage at the IOC, and for her long-time mentor Bach, and evidence of his influence over an organisation he has ruled since 2013, and with its membership - most of which he has appointed.
The result will also intensify scrutiny of the IOC's secretive and highly restrictive election process.
The exclusive organisation - made up of royals, heads of state, former athletes and figures from business and politics - seems resistant to the change that candidates like Coe stood for.
The double Olympic champion was the reform candidate, but his pledge to shake up the IOC clearly did not appeal to many.
At World Athletics, Coe had taken a tougher stance than the IOC on Russian doping and gender eligibility, and introduced the idea of cash for gold medals at Paris 2024, a move that antagonised Bach.
The rules require the IOC hierarchy to remain neutral in any presidential election.
Coe was magnanimous in the immediate aftermath of defeat, but it was telling perhaps that when I asked him if it had been a fair fight, he simply answered, ""Oh, it's an election.""
Coventry is the youngest person - and the first from outside Europe or North America - to be elected president of the IOC
Coventry has pledged to introduce a blanket ban on transgender women competing in female Olympic competition, insisting that she will protect women athletes and that fairness and safety are paramount.
But critics have pointed out that she was also a member of the IOC's executive board when it allowed two boxers who had reportedly failed gender eligibility tests to compete in the women's boxing competition at the Paris 2024 Olympics.
While the IOC insisted the fighters were women, and questioned the credibility of the tests, the controversy led to intense scrutiny of the organisation's rules, and threatened to engulf the Games.
Coventry's career has been intertwined with politics for years.
In 2008, she accepted a $100,000 reward from Zimbabwe's authoritarian leader president Robert Mugabe - given to her in a suitcase - for winning four medals at the Beijing Games.
The gift came at a time of severe food shortages and inflation, and the swimmer announced she was giving some of the money to charity. Mugabe's later years in power were marked by violent repression of his political opponents and Zimbabwe's economic ruin.
Although at the time Coventry did speak out about the need for change in Zimbabwe, as an athlete she tried to avoid being drawn into politics. In 2018 however she became sports minister for Mugabe's successor - controversial president Emmerson Mnangagwa - known as 'The Crocodile' for his ruthlessness and political cunning.
Mnangagwa - who has congratulated Coventry
, external
- is associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling party since independence in 1980.
In 2023 campaign group Amnesty said his government had ""failed to live up to its promises for change and break with Mugabe's brutal human rights legacy"" and said authorities had ""systematically supressed peaceful dissent"".
Last year the United States imposed sanctions on Mnangagwa and other senior officials for corruption and human rights abuses.
Coventry has also faced criticism for her record as sports minister. In 2020 Zimbabwe's stadiums were banned by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) from hosting all international games for substandard facilities. And in 2022, during Coventry's tenure, football's world governing body Fifa banned Zimbabwe from international fixtures over governmental interference in the running of the game.
Coventry's close ties with Mnangagwa will inevitably lead to questions over her suitability to lead the IOC, but last month she defended her role when interviewed by BBC Sport.
""I don't believe you can really create change if you don't have a seat at the table"" she said.
""It's not been the easiest thing but I have had incredible support and we are making a difference. Having to navigate very sensitive issues has definitely given me extra 'armour' if I can put it that way for what [the IOC] will face in in the future, and we're going to have to navigate difficult leaders that have different opinions on things.""
Coventry's diplomatic skills are about to be put to the test.
She will assume her new role in June at a critical time for the Olympic movement, and amid a tense geopolitical landscape in which sport has become increasingly weaponised.
Major challenges could include the potential reintegration of Russia which was banned following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and building a relationship with US president Donald Trump before the next summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028.
There are just eight months until the next winter Games in northern Italy, and a host for the 2036 Olympics must be chosen.
Long-term issues include gender eligibility, climate change, doping, and ensuring the Games remain relevant going forward amid a rapidly-changing media and entertainment landscape.
Many in Africa will hope that Coventry's success could increase the continent's chances of hosting the Games for the first time.
In November the IOC said it welcomed interest from South Africa
, external
in hosting the 2036 Games. Competition is expected to come from India and the Middle East.
Speaking to the BBC on Friday Michael Payne, the former IOC director of marketing, said: ""There is no doubt that the influence of Africa in world sport will grow because of this appointment.""",Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8yz0e22dro,Ghosts of apartheid haunt South Africa as compensation anger brews,2025-03-19T01:01:07.352Z,"Sumaya Bakhsh
BBC News","It was late at night on 10 December 1987 when prison officers had woken Mzolisi Dyasi in his cell in South Africa's Eastern Cape province.
He remembers the bumpy drive to a hospital morgue where he was asked to identify the bodies of his pregnant girlfriend, his cousin and a fellow anti-apartheid fighter.
In response, he had dropped to one knee, raised his fist in the air, and attempted to shout ""amandla!"" (""power"" in Zulu), in an act of defiance.
But the word caught in his throat as he was ""totally broken"", Mr Dyasi tells the BBC, recalling the sight of his loved ones under the cold, bright lights.
Four decades on, Mr Dyasi sleeps with the lights on to ward off memories of the physical and mental torture he suffered during his four years in prison.
He says that he struggled to build a life for himself in the society he fought for as an underground operative for uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the-then banned African National Congress (ANC).
The ANC led the struggle against the racist system of apartheid, which ended in 1994 with the party's rise to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election.
A Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which was co-chaired by the internationally renowned cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was established to uncover the atrocities committed by the apartheid regime, and a state reparations fund was set up to assist some of the victims.
But much of that money has largely gone unspent.
Mr Dyasi was among about 17,000 people who received a one-off payment of 30,000 rand ($3,900; £2,400 at the time) from it in 2003, but he says that has done very little to help him.
He had wanted to complete his university education but has still not paid for courses he took in 1997.
Now in his 60s, he suffers from chronic health issues and finds it difficult to afford medication on the special pension he receives for veterans who participated in the struggle for freedom and democracy.
Professor Tshepo Madlingozi - a member of South Africa's Human Rights Commission who spoke to the BBC in his personal capacity - says the effects of apartheid continue to be devastating.
""It was not only about the killing of people, the disappearance of people, it was about locking people into intergenerational impoverishment.""
He says that despite the progress made over the past 30 years, many of the ""born-free generation"" - South Africans born after 1994 - have inherited the cycle.
The reparations fund has about $110m untouched, with no clarity on why this is the case.
""What is the money being used for? Is the money still there?"" Prof Madlingozi commented.
The government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.
Lawyer Howard Varney has spent much of his career representing victims of apartheid-era crimes and says that the story of reparations in South Africa is one of ""deep betrayal"" for the families affected.
He is currently representing a group of victims' families and survivors who are suing the South African government for $9m over what they say is its failure to adequately handle cases of political crimes that were highlighted by the now-disbanded TRC for further investigations and prosecutions.
Brian Mphahlele was polite and soft-spoken; he would pause before responding to a question, as if waiting for his thoughts to pool in his mind.
He suffered from memory loss, just one aspect of the lasting impact of the physical and psychological torture he had undergone at Cape Town's notorious Pollsmoor Prison.
Mr Mphahlele told the BBC that the 30,000 rand pay-out, which he had received for the violations he endured during his 10 years in prison, was an insult.
""It went through my fingers. It went through everybody's fingers, it was so little,"" the 68-year-old said on the phone last year from his nephew's home in Langa township in Cape Town, where he lived.
He felt that a more substantial payment would have enabled him to buy his own home and described his frustration at his life in Langa, where he ate at a soup kitchen three times a week.
Since he spoke to the BBC, Mr Mphahlele has died, his hope of a more comfortable life unfulfilled.
Prof Madlingozi says that South Africa became the ""poster child"" of racial reconciliation following the end of apartheid, and inspired the world in many ways.
""But we have also unintentionally given a wrong message, which is that a crime against humanity can be committed without consequence,"" he says.
Though he feels things can still be turned around.
""South Africa has an opportunity 30 years into democracy to show that you can make mistakes and fix those mistakes.""
Mr Dyasi still remembers the sense of freedom and optimism he felt when he left prison in 1990 after South Africa's last white ruler FW de Klerk unbanned the ANC and other liberation movements, paving the way for anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela to become the first black president four years later.
But Mr Dyasi says he does not feel proud of who he is today, and his disappointment is felt by many who fought alongside him and their families.
""We don't want to be millionaires,"" he says. ""But if the government could just look at the healthcare of these people, if it could look after their livelihood, involve them in the economic system of the country.""
""There were children that were orphaned by the struggle. Some children wanted to go to school but they still can't. Some people are homeless.
""And some people would say, 'You were in prison, you were shot at. But what is it that you can show for it?'""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg10rle1lvo,The expelled envoy at the heart of the latest US-South Africa row,2025-03-18T02:47:05.335Z,"Khanyisile Ngcobo
BBC News, Johannesburg","As a veteran of the anti-apartheid struggle and himself a victim of the inequities of that racist system of government, Ebrahim Rasool was always unlikely to mince his words when it came to assessing the new US administration.
But in a message to family and friends, South Africa's top envoy in Washington sounded almost relaxed about the diplomatic ructions that he had caused.
Soon after it was announced at the weekend that he was going to be expelled from the US, Ambassador Rasool wrote that he and his family were ""all packed up and looking forward to returning to South Africa"" and said he was leaving the US with ""no regrets"".
On Friday, his prepared remarks on the new government in the US were delivered in a thoughtful, measured manner – with no hint of the trouble that they would trigger.
In a webinar organised by a South African think-tank, the 62-year-old seasoned politician was speaking about the policies of President Donald Trump and the implications for Africa.
The talk was coming after weeks of pressure on South Africa from Washington over a controversial land law that resulted in the US cutting off funding to the country.
The US government alleged that South Africa's white minority was being unfairly targeted. An allegation robustly refuted by the government in Pretoria.
In Rasool's view he thought that President Trump was ""mobilising a supremacism"" and trying to ""project white victimhood as a dog whistle"" as the white population faced becoming a minority in the US.
The comments resulted in sharply divided opinions locally and internationally over whether he was walking a ""fine line"" as a diplomat in giving an ""honest assessment"" or ""crossed a line"" that no ambassador should cross.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was unequivocal in his response, saying that Rasool was ""no longer welcome"" in the US because he was a ""race-baiting politician who hates America"" and Trump.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's office said the US decision to expel Rasool was ""regrettable"" as the president himself defended the ""great deal of progress"" the ambassador had been making prior to his expulsion.
""So this is actually a hiccup... that we are working on straightening out,"" Ramaphosa told reporters on Monday repeating a stance aimed at cooling temperatures.
Officials in his government however, were more scathing in their assessment of the diplomat's actions, telling South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, in an anonymous briefing, that Rasool's actions were an ""isolated incident of somebody who crossed a line that diplomats know they shouldn't cross"".
In the US, the chairperson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch, lauded Rubio for calling out Rasool's ""disgraceful"" remarks.
But to those in South Africa who know Rasool, his views on the White House's policies and the way he expressed them came as no surprise.
Growing up in Cape Town and classified as ""coloured"" by the apartheid system, Rasool, as a young boy, along with his family, was forced to leave his home in the centre of the city.
The racial zoning imposed by the government meant that people who were not classified as ""white"" had to live in poorly provisioned areas a long way from the heart of Cape Town.
Rasool's activism began in the 1970s during his school years.
""I really had no idea where I was going until after I tasted my first tear gas, saw my first rubber bullet and fled my first whop from the police when I entered high school in 1976,"" Georgetown University quoted him as saying for a profile piece in 2015.
""That experience was life-altering. It gave me a crash course in politics.""
This activism would later result in his imprisonment near Cape Town, where he crossed paths with Nelson Mandela, who would go on to be South Africa's first democratically elected president.
Rasool served in various leadership positions within the governing African National Congress and South Africa before being appointed to his first stint as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.
He was named as ambassador again in 2024, because of his previous experience and extensive network of Washington contacts.
Faiez Jacobs, who has known Rasool for over 30 years, first as fellow activists fighting against apartheid and then within the ANC, came to his defence over his recent comments.
He was one of the attendees at the virtual event.
According to Mr Jacobs, Rasool was asked to provide an analysis on the current situation in the US and did so in a ""very objective, academic"" way. He added that though the envoy was explaining his honestly held views and was not trying to stir up trouble, he detected another motive for the reaction.
""The fact that he [is] a Muslim, the fact that he represented our country's views on Palestine… Those are all the real reasons why he's been he's been targeted,"" Mr Jacobs told the BBC.
Last year, South Africa took Israel to the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel was engaging in ""genocidal acts"" in Gaza, which it denied.
University of Johannesburg international relations expert Oscar van Heerden said that on his appointment Rasool was ""dealt a bad hand"" and ""knew and understood"" what he was getting himself into this time around.
""Knives were already out for Rasool before he even arrived in Washington… [and] by the time he arrived it was a mere formality to find a reason to be able to get rid of him,"" Dr Van Heerden said.
The academic first crossed paths with Rasool in 1985 while he was a student and the diplomat was a high school teacher who was ""guiding youngsters"" like himself and giving them the ""necessary political education"".
He described Rasool as a ""devout Muslim"" who ""stands for the Palestinian cause of self-determination"".
On Rasool's view of the Trump government, Dr Van Heerden said the diplomat was caught in a ""difficult position"" because he had to deal with an ""openly antagonistic"" host nation that in his opinion had weaponised diplomacy and foreign policy.
And while plans are reportedly under way to find a replacement for Rasool, Dr Van Heerden argued that no amount of experience or seniority would be enough to appease the Trump administration and that only someone they ""completely agree with"" may succeed.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kg1ezyv5xo,'I was duped into leaving London for school in Ghana - but it saved me',2025-03-16T00:11:47.592Z,"Mark Wilberforce
Accra","When my mother told me at the age of 16 that we were going from the UK to Ghana for the summer holidays, I had no reason to doubt her.
It was just a quick trip, a temporary break - nothing to worry about. Or so I thought.
One month in, she dropped the bombshell - I was not coming back to London until I had reformed and had earned enough GCSEs to continue my education.
I was hoodwinked in a similar way to the British-Ghanaian teenager who recently took his parents to the High Court in London for sending him to school in Ghana.
In their defence, they told the judge they did not want to see their 14-year-old son become ""yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London"".
Back in the mid-1990s, my mother, a primary school teacher, was motivated by similar concerns.
I had been excluded from two high schools in the London Borough of Brent, hanging out with the wrong crowd (becoming the wrong crowd) - and heading down a dangerous path.
My closest friends at the time ended up in prison for armed robbery. Had I stayed in London, I would have almost certainly been convicted with them.
But being sent to Ghana also felt like a prison sentence.
I can empathise to a degree with the teenager, who said in his court statement that he feels like he is ""living in hell"".
Yet, speaking for myself, by the time I turned 21 I realised what my mother had done had been a blessing.
Unlike the boy at the centre of the London court case - which he lost - I did not go to boarding school in Ghana.
My mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction.
I first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra.
The lifestyle change hit hard. In London, I had my own bedroom, access to washing machines and a sense of independence - even if I was using it recklessly.
In Ghana, I was waking up at 05:00 to sweep the courtyard and wash my uncle's often muddy pick-up truck and my aunt's car.
It was her vehicle that I would later steal - something of a watershed moment.
I did not even know how to drive properly, treating a manual like an automatic and I crashed it into a high-ranking soldier's Mercedes.
I tried to flee the scene. But that soldier caught me and threatened to take me to Burma Camp, the notorious military base where people had disappeared in the past.
That was the last truly reckless thing I did.
It was not just discipline that I learnt in Ghana - it was perspective.
Life in Ghana showed me how much I had taken for granted.
Washing clothes by hand and preparing meals with my aunt made me appreciate the effort needed.
Food, like everything in Ghana, required patience. There were no microwaves, no fast-food runs.
Making the traditional dough-like dish fufu, for example, is laborious and involves pounding cooked yams or cassava into a paste with a mortar.
At the time, it felt like punishment. Looking back, it was building resilience.
Initially, my uncles considered placing me in high-end schools like the Ghana International School or SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College.
But they were smart. They knew I might just form a new crew to cause chaos and mischief.
Instead, I received private tuition at Accra Academy, a state secondary school that my late father had attended. It meant I was often taught on my own or in small groups.
Lessons were in English, but out of school those around me were often speaking local languages and I found it easy to pick them up perhaps because it was such an immersive experience.
Back home in London, I used to love to learn swear words in my mother's Fante language - but was far from fluent.
When I later moved to the city of Tema to stay with my favourite uncle, Uncle Jojo - an agricultural expert, I continued private tuition at Tema Secondary School.
In contrast to the boy making the headlines in the UK, who claimed Ghana's education system was not up to standard, I found it to be exacting.
I was considered academically gifted in the UK, despite my troublesome ways, but actually found it tough going in Ghana. Students my age were far ahead in subjects like maths and science.
The rigour of the Ghanaian system pushed me to study harder than I ever had in London.
The result? I earned five GCSEs with grades C and above - something that once seemed impossible.
Beyond academic achievements, Ghanaian society instilled values that have stayed with me for life.
Respect for elders was non-negotiable. Throughout the neighbourhoods I lived in, you greeted those older than you, regardless of whether or not you knew them.
Ghana did not just make me more disciplined and respectful - it made me fearless.
Football played a huge part in that transformation. I played in the parks, which were often hard red clay with loose pebbles and stones, with two square goalposts fashioned out of wood and string.
It was a far cry from the neatly maintained pitches in England, but it toughened me up in ways I could not have imagined - and it is no wonder some of the greatest footballers seen in the English Premier League have come from West Africa.
The aggressive style played in Ghana was not just about skill - it was about resilience and endurance. Getting tackled on rough ground meant picking yourself up, dusting yourself off and carrying on.
Every Sunday, I played football on the beach - though I would often be late because there was absolutely no way either of my uncles would allow me to stay home instead of attending church.
Those services felt like they lasted forever. But it was also a testament to Ghana as a God-fearing nation, where faith is deeply embedded in everyday life.
The first 18 months were the hardest. I resented the restrictions, the chores, the discipline.
I even tried stealing my passport to fly back to London, but my mother was ahead of me and had hidden it well. There was no escape.
My only choice was to adapt. Somewhere along the way, I stopped seeing Ghana as a prison and started seeing it as happy home.
I know of a few others like me who were sent back to Ghana by their parents living in London.
Michael Adom was 17 when he arrived in Accra for school in the 1990s, describing his experience as ""bittersweet"". He stayed until he was 23 and now lives back in London working as a probation officer.
His main complaint was the loneliness - he missed his family and friends. There were times of anger about his situation and the complications of feeling misunderstood.
This largely stemmed from the fact that his parents had not taught him or his siblings any of the local languages when growing up in London.
""I didn't understand Ga. I didn't understand Twi. I didn't understand Pidgin,"" the 49-year-old tells me.
This made him feel vulnerable for his first two-and-a-half years - and, he says, liable to being fleeced, for example, by those increasing prices because he seemed foreign.
""Anywhere I went, I had to make sure I went with somebody else,"" he says.
But he ended up becoming fluent in Twi and, overall, he believes the positives outweighed the negatives: ""It made me a man.
""My Ghana experience matured me and changed me for the better, by helping me to identify with who I am, as a Ghanaian, and cemented my understanding of my culture, background and family history.""
I can concur with this. By my third year, I had fallen in love with the culture and even stayed on for nearly two more years after passing my GCSEs.
I developed a deep appreciation of the local food. Back in London, I never thought twice about what I was eating. But in Ghana, food was not just sustenance - each dish had its own story.
I became obsessed with ""waakye"" - a dish made from rice and black-eyed peas, often cooked with millet leaves, giving it a distinctive purple-brown colour. It was usually served with fried plantain, the spicy black pepper sauce ""shito"", boiled eggs, and sometimes even spaghetti or fried fish. It was the ultimate comfort food.
I enjoyed the music, the warmth of the people and the sense of community. I was not just ""stuck"" in Ghana any more - I was thriving.
My mother, Patience Wilberforce, passed away recently, and with her loss I have reflected deeply on the decision she made all those years ago.
She saved me. Had she not tricked me into staying in Ghana, the chances of me having a criminal record or even serving time in prison would have been extremely high.
I went on to enrol at the College of North West London aged 20 to study media production and communications, before joining BBC Radio 1Xtra via a mentoring scheme.
The guys I used to hang out with in north-west London did not get the second chance that I did.
Ghana reshaped my mindset, my values and my future. It turned a misguided menace into a responsible man.
While such an experience might not work for everyone, it gave me the education, discipline and respect I needed to reintegrate into society when I returned to England.
And for that, I am forever indebted to my mother, to my uncles and to the country that saved me.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg8x8v33ko,'Tortured and terrified' - BBC witnesses the battle for Khartoum,2025-03-14T22:03:22.139Z,"Barbara Plett Usher
BBC News, Khartoum","The BBC has heard evidence of atrocities committed by retreating fighters in a battle raging for control of Sudan's capital city Khartoum.
The city has been held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since the start of the country's brutal civil war nearly two years ago - but the army has retaken much of it and believes it is on track to seize the rest.
Regaining the capital would be a tremendous victory for the military and a turning-point in the war, although by itself would not end the conflict.
In recent weeks troops have mostly encircled Khartoum, coming up from the south after surging through central Sudan, and clearing city districts in the north and east, squeezing the remaining RSF fighters into the centre.
Vast areas of the reclaimed territory are completely destroyed.
Travelling with the army, we drove past block after block of damaged and ransacked buildings - some of them blackened by fire, many pockmarked with bullet holes.
The pavements in front of them were littered with vandalised vehicles, pieces of discarded furniture, the soiled remains of looted goods and other debris.
But even in places that look untouched, the terror is fresh.
In Haj Yusuf, a district of Khartoum east of the River Nile, residents described chaos and violence as fleeing RSF fighters turned on civilians.
""It was a shock, they came suddenly,"" says Intisar Adam Suleiman.
Two of her sons, 18-year-old Muzamil and 21-year-old Mudather, were sitting by the house with a friend. The RSF soldiers ordered them inside, then shot them in the back as they entered the gate, says Ms Suleiman.
Muzamil escaped with a bullet wound in his leg but ""our friend died instantly"", he told me.
""Then the men wanted to enter the house, and my mother tried to hold the door shut, pushing and pushing. They spotted a phone on the ground, grabbed it and left. I went and called the father of my friend so he could come and do first aid, but we couldn't rescue him.""
Mudather died the next morning because the hospital's blood bank had been decimated by a long power outage and he could not get the transfusion he needed.
Ms Suleiman says she knew the RSF soldiers and had engaged with them before to try and de-escalate violence.
One of them had told her: ""We came for death, we are people of death.""
She says she told them: ""If you came for death, this is not the place for death.""
Yet too much death is what Ms Suleiman has seen in this war.
So many people have died, she says: ""I've become used to these traumas.""
A few blocks away, Asma Mubarak Abdel Karim tells me she and a group of women got caught up in the fighting as Sudanese forces closed in.
She says they were confronted by retreating RSF soldiers who accused them of siding with the military because they had been to a market in army-held territory.
""They shot on the ground around us, around our feet, terrifying us,"" she says, explaining how they then pulled one woman into an empty house and raped her.
She says the RSF fighter held the woman at gunpoint and told her: ""Come with us.""
He was beating her with his weapon, says Ms Karim.
""And then we heard shooting and the man ordering her to: 'Take it off! Do this! Do that!' Then the fighting around us intensified and we couldn't hear any more - bullets were falling in the area, so we hid inside the house.""
She wipes away tears when asked what the best thing about the situation is for her now.
""Security,"" she says softly, ""the best thing is security. They tortured us so terribly.""
An RSF spokesman denied the reports, saying the group had controlled this area for two years ""without any major crimes"" and that ""massive killings"" had been reported in areas taken by the military.
The army and allied militias have been accused of carrying out widespread atrocities after recapturing territory, in particular the central Gezira state.
The UN and US say both sides have committed war crimes, but singled out the RSF for criticism of mass rape and accusations of genocide.
It is not only the RSF foot soldiers who are on the move.
Top officials have abandoned their homes in the nearby affluent suburb of Karfuri.
The RSF elite had embedded itself into Khartoum's establishment before the paramilitary group and the army turned on each other in April 2023 in a battle for control.
Karfuri is now eerily empty and thoroughly looted.
Even the house of the RSF's deputy commander, Abdel Rahim Hamdan Dagalo, and brother of the group's leader, was not spared.
The big empty swimming pool in the yard is scattered with rubbish.
Sofas in the spacious rooms are overturned, the windows broken, gold jewellery boxes are bare, the door of a waist-high safe has been pulled off.
The army says it believes that most of the RSF senior leadership is now outside the city, and that those still fighting for the heart of Khartoum are the junior commanders and lower-ranking soldiers.
We were told the military was using drones to drop leaflets urging remaining fighters to leave rather than fight street by street.
The samples we were shown are written in Arabic but also French, apparently directed at foreign fighters from neighbouring Chad.
""Lay down your weapon, change into civilian clothes, and leave the area to save your life,"" says one.
In Khartoum North, closer to the Nile, the RSF was pushed out several months ago, but the calm is regularly punctured by the sound of shelling as the army fires at the group's positions across the river.
Many people here say they finally feel safe enough to sleep at night but are still taking stock of extensive damage.
Zeinab Osman al-Haj showed me the wreckage of her house, telling me the RSF fighters would come at night and break down the door if she didn't open it.
""They filled their backpacks, and even my food supply, my sugar and my flour and my oil, the soap, they took it,"" before eventually burning the house down, she says.
""This was not a war,"" she says, pointing at the pile of ashes where her brother-in-law's library once stood, the charred bedframes in the ruined bedrooms.
""This was chaos: there was theft and stealing and robbery, that's it.""
A few streets down we meet Hussein Abbas.
He is nearly 70 years old, walking with a cane and dragging a battered suitcase down an empty street toward a skyline of burned and gutted buildings.
He tells us he has been displaced three times since leaving the capital seven days after the war began.
""The moment I got off here I almost cried,"" he says, as tears begin rolling down his cheeks. ""For two years, two years I haven't seen this place. We suffered a lot, extreme suffering.""
Survivors like Mr Abbas are slowly returning to try and salvage their homes.
The army has the upper hand now in this terrible war, but there is much suffering still to come for Sudan's people.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice as Gabon beat Kenya 2-1 in qualifying for the 2026 Fifa World Cup - and severely dented the East Africans' hopes of reaching the finals.
Victory sent Gabon two points clear of Ivory Coast at the top of Group F as the Panthers strengthened their own bid for a maiden appearance at the tournament.
Kenya are fourth, nine points behind the Group F leaders.
Former Arsenal striker Aubameyang opened the scoring when he lashed home with a right-footed shot in the 16th minute, and the 35-year-old celebrated with some trademark acrobatics.
Harambee Stars captain Michael Olunga had the best chances to equalise in Nairobi, having a shot tipped on to the post and then heading wide in first-half injury time.
Aubameyang, who now plays his club football in Saudi Arabia with Al-Qadsiah, doubled Gabon's lead from the penalty spot seven minutes after the break after Erick Ouma was penalised for handball.
Olunga did pull one back in the 62nd minute, converting Ouma's low cross from the left, but Kenya could not find an equaliser and their chances of a first trip to the World Cup are fading with just four rounds of fixtures remaining.

Only the group winners are assured of a place at next year's tournament, while the four best second-placed sides across the nine groups will enter play-offs for a place at an intercontinental qualifier.
Benni McCarthy had claimed a draw against The Gambia on Thursday in his first match as Harambee Stars boss, but defeat leaves Kenya seven points behind second-placed Ivory Coast, having played a game more than the Elephants.
The sixth round of the group campaign continues with eight fixtures on Monday, and Ivory Coast will return to the top of Group F if they beat the Gambians at home.
Elsewhere, Mauritius fought back from 2-0 down and then scored an injury-time equaliser to claim a 3-3 draw away against Eswatini in Group D.
Eswatini had surprisingly claimed their first point on Wednesday with a solid defensive display against five-time continental champions Cameroon, and were rewarded for their early ambition against Mauritius.
Philani Mkhonto twice capitalised on hesitant defending to put the hosts 2-0 up inside 18 minutes in Mbombela.
But set-pieces proved to be Eswatini's undoing in the second half as the visitors drew level within five minutes of the restart through goals from Lindsay Rose and Yannick Aristide.
Mayibongwe Mabuza put Eswatini 3-2 up but Emmanuel Vincent rescued a point for the Indian Ocean islanders with his 91st minute free-kick.
Eswatini remain bottom of Group D on two points, while Mauritius are just above them in fifth spot on five points.

Sudan's impressive run in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup continued as a nation affected by civil war held Senegal to a 0-0 draw on neutral turf.
Sadio Mane came closest to a winner for the visitors late on in Benina, Libya, but saw an attempted chip saved by Sudan keeper Mohamed Mostafa before his follow-up effort was blocked by a defender on the line.
Mostafa then pulled off a stunning low stop to keep out a header from Cherif Ndiaye.
Sudan could have taken all three points themselves as Walieldin Khedr sent a shot flashing past the post earlier in the second half.
The Falcons of Jediane sit a point clear of DR Congo at the top of Group B halfway through the African campaign, with Senegal a point further behind.
Only the group winners are assured of a place at the expanded 48-team World Cup finals next year.

Elsewhere in Group B, Togo and Mauritania drew 2-2 in an entertaining contest in Lome.
Those four sides are all back in action on Tuesday when Sudan host South Sudan, Senegal welcome Togo and DR Congo travel to Mauritania.
The final four group fixtures will be split across September and October.
Almost two years on from the start of the civil war, and with the country's top two domestic clubs now playing in Mauritania, Sudan coach James Kwesi Appiah has got supporters dreaming of reaching the World Cup finals for the first time.
In the nine-month hiatus since the last qualifying fixtures the Sudanese had remarkably booked a place at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations - eliminating four-time continental champions Ghana along the way.
But, returning to their bid to reach the United States, Mexico and Canada, Sudan almost made a disastrous start as goalkeeper Mustafa missed a clearing kick within the first 30 seconds.
However, he managed to recover and scramble the loose ball behind with Boulaye Dia set to pounce and slot into an empty net.
The hosts were not overawed by a side ranked as the second best in Africa, and 96 places above them, and Aboubaker Eisa missed a chance to slot Sudan in front in the 20th minute before Dia sent a header off target.
After the break Sudan midfielder Adbel Raouf tested Edouard Mendy with a low strike before having appeals for a penalty waved away as he challenged the keeper for the rebound.
Mane had sent an overhead kick narrowly wide before the former Liverpool forward was denied twice with 10 minutes remaining.
The West Africans remain unbeaten after five games in Group B but, with only two wins, have work to do to reach a third successive World Cup finals.

Aboubakary Koita was on target for Mauritania
Earlier on Saturday, Mauritania scored their first goals of the campaign as they secured a draw in Togo.
Thibault Klidje headed the hosts ahead in Lome in the fourth minute, and Mauritania came close to an equaliser when Aboubakary Koita hit the right-hand upright 10 minutes before the break.
The game sparked into life in the second half as the visitors scored twice in the space of four minutes to turn the game on its head.
First Koita levelled with a fine curing shot across goal and then Abdallahi Mahmoud was presented with a simple tap-in at the back post from Sidi Bouna Amar's low cross.
Kevin Denkey dragged Togo level in the 69th minute when he dispossessed Lamine Ba in the box and rifled in a low shot.
After that both sides had chances to win it as Mauritania striker Pape Yade struck a post after capitalising on an error from Sparrowhawks goalkeeper Malcolm Barcoa and then Togo substitute Kwame Mawuena narrowly missed the target with a header.",Africa

Victor Osimhen inspired Nigeria to their first win in World Cup 2026 qualifying, while Mohamed Salah helped strengthen Egypt's bid to reach the finals.
Algeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and South Africa all moved top of their groups and Morocco sealed a late victory amid a busy day which saw 11 qualifiers played across the continent.
Liverpool forward Salah calmly put Egypt in front away against Ethiopia and then turned provider for Zizo to double the lead before the break.
The Pharaohs have established a five-point lead in Group A at the halfway stage of the campaign.
Meanwhile, on-loan Galatasaray striker Osimhen netted both goals in Nigeria's 2-0 victory in Rwanda, and the Super Eagles are now four points behind South Africa in Group C.
Bafana Bafana moved to the summit after overcoming a stubborn Lesotho side 2-0 thanks to second-half strikes from Relebohile Mofokeng and Jayden Adams.
Only the nine group winners are assured of a place at the expanded 48-team World Cup finals next year.
The four best second-placed sides after 10 games will enter play-offs, with the winners getting a chance to qualify via an intercontinental tournament.

Bilal El Khannouss scored an injury-time winner to spare Morocco's blushes against unfancied Niger and open up a six-point lead in Group E.
The West Africans, hosting the game in the Moroccan city of Oujda, took a surprise second-half lead through Youssef Oumarou but Ismael Saibari equalised on the hour mark.
Leicester City midfielder El Khannouss was left unmarked at the back post to stoop and head in Noussair Mazraoui's cross and give the Atlas Lions a ninth consecutive competitive win.
Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo and Leicester's Jordan Ayew were both on target as Ghana thrashed Chad 5-0 in Accra to move two points above Madagascar in Group I.
Continental champions Ivory Coast laboured to a 1-0 away win over Burundi after Evann Guessand rifled in the only goal in the 16th minute.
The Elephants remain unbeaten and have a one-point advantage over Gabon in Group F.
Elsewhere, DR Congo moved level on points with surprise Group B leaders Sudan as Theo Bongonda's powerful effort secured a 1-0 win over South Sudan after a disjointed display in Kinshasa.
Burkina Faso and Equatorial Guinea registered comfortable wins, with Emilio Nsue scoring for the latter on his return to action following a row over his eligibility.
Victor Osimhen took his tally to 25 goals in 40 senior appearances for Nigeria
Nigeria's bid for a place at the finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada was in the balance after taking just three points from their first four matches.
Osimhen had been absent through injury from all those games, played across November 2023 and June last year, and had spoken befire the crucial trip to Kigali of how ""desperate"" he and his team-mates are to reach the tournament.
The pressure was also on new boss Eric Chelle, who is the first non-Nigerian African to take charge of the Super Eagles.
But Osimhen settled any nerves in the 11th minute when he was left unmarked at the back post to guide in Ademola Lookman's free-kick.
And the striker capitalised on hesitant defending before racing clear and dinking past the onrushing keeper to double the lead in first-half injury time.
Nigeria move up to fourth in Group C, behind South Africa, Benin and Rwanda, and will host bottom side Zimbabwe in their next match on Tuesday.
Emilio Nsue won the golden boot at Afcon 2023, scoring five goals in four games
One other talisman who netted on his return to action was Nsue, the top scorer at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations who was then remarkably ruled ineligible to play for Equatorial Guinea by Fifa.
Forced to sit out the qualifying campaign for the 2025 Afcon, the 35-year-old was available again following a second request by his national federation to the world governing body.
Nsue needed just 14 minutes to net against Sao Tome e Principe and extend his all-time national record to 23 goals for the National Thunder.
The striker was then involved in the build-up for the second goal three minutes later which ended with Iban Salvador guiding his shot home after brilliant interplay with Jose Machin inside the box.
Equatorial Guinea are fifth in Group H, seven points behind leaders Tunisia, having been handed two 3-0 defeats after Nsue appeared and scored in their first two qualifiers.
Algeria moved back to the top of Group G, on goal difference ahead of Mozambique, following a 3-1 win against Botswana in a sweltering Francistown.
Amine Gouiri broke the deadlock just before half time with a header which home keeper Goitseone Phoko fumbled over the line, and two smart finishes after the break from Mohamed Amoura gave the North Africans their fourth win in five outings.
Guinea are five points behind Algeria after being held to a 0-0 draw by Somalia.
Visiting goalkeeper Abdirahman Mohamud Jama pulled off a string of saves in an inspired defensive display.
The East Africans almost won it late on through Yusuf Ahmed, but held on through six minutes of stoppage time to secure their first point.
Burkina Faso went second in Group A as former Aston Villa forward Bertrand Traore netted in their 4-1 win over Djibouti.
Josue Tiendrebeogo, Mohamed Zougrana and Lassina Traore also found the net for the Stallions, who lie five points adrift of Egypt.

Mali revive World Cup campaign as Cape Verde top group",Africa

Benin, Cape Verde, Gabon and Mozambique all moved top of their 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifying groups as the fifth round of the African campaign continued following a nine-month hiatus.
Among nine games on Thursday, Mali revived their challenge as Kamory Doumbia scored twice in their 3-0 away win against Comoros in neutral Morocco.
The Eagles had sacked Eric Chelle last June after winning just one of their first four games in Group I, and his replacement Tom Saintfiet is hoping to lead the West Africans to the finals for the first time.
Mali are now two points behind group leaders Madagascar and one below Ghana and Comoros.
The continent has nine guaranteed spots at the expanded 48-team tournament, and several traditional heavyweights are struggling as preliminaries reach the halfway stage.
Benin rose to the top of Group C despite squandering a 2-0 lead to draw against Zimbabwe after Wolves forward Marshall Munetsi started the comeback for the Warriors.
That result will be welcomed by Nigeria, who sit five points below their West African neighbours and will look to get their qualification bid back on track against Rwanda in one of 11 matches scheduled on Friday.
Mozambique beat 10-man Uganda 3-1 to move three points ahead of Algeria in Group G, although the North Africans could regain top spot with victory over Botswana.
Denis Bouanga's double helped Gabon claim a 3-0 win over Seychelles in Group F – a result which puts the Panthers two points above Ivory Coast before the reigning continental champions travel to Burundi.

Cape Verde, meanwhile, capitalised on Cameroon dropping points on Wednesday with a narrow 1-0 triumph against Mauritius.
Yannick Semedo's fortuitous winner, netting from an attempted cross, helped the islanders edge one point ahead of the Indomitable Lions in Group D.
Elsewhere, Africa Cup of Nations-winning coach Aliou Cisse was denied victory in his first game in charge of Libya as Angola netted a 93rd-minute equaliser.
Kenya salvaged a dramatic 3-3 draw in stoppage time against The Gambia in Benni McCarthy's first game in charge of the East Africans.
One manager who did make a winning start was Mohamed Kallon, whose Sierra Leone side revived their campaign by beating Guinea-Bissau 3-1.
That victory moved the Leone Stars up to second place in Group A, two points behind leaders Egypt, who have a game in hand.
In Group H, Namibia closed the gap to Tunisia to two points as Prins Tjiueza's strike saw off Malawi.
Uganda, who will co-host the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations, did have a chance to move level on points with the sides at the top of Group G, but paid the price for an error-strewn display away against Mozambique in neutral Cairo.
Pepo Santos put the hosts ahead direct from an inswinging third-minute corner which Cranes keeper Ismail Watenga could only palm into his own net despite being under no pressure.
Muhammad Shaban quickly equalised for Uganda with a header but Watenga gifted Santos a second when he failed to claim a low cross from the left.
Uganda forward Denis Omedi was sent off for a second bookable offence seven minutes before the break and Stanley Ratifo capitalised on hesitancy in the visiting defence to make the points safe in first-half stoppage time.
Benni McCarthy spent two years as a first-team coach at Manchester United before leaving Old Trafford at the end of last season
The most entertaining game of the day came in neutral Abidjan as The Gambia and Kenya shared six goals – although the result did little to help either side qualify for a first ever World Cup.
Kenya goalkeeper Ian Otieno saved Musa Barrow's penalty on the half-hour mark and the game sparked into life after the break when Barrow made amends by netting a brilliant curling shot to put the Gambians in front in the 55th minute.
Brighton forward Yankuba Minteh doubled the lead six minutes later but Michael Olunga and Mohammed Bajaber struck in the space of six minutes to drag Kenya level.
Barrow side-footed home with six minutes left to make it 3-2 to the Scorpions yet William Wilson stabbed in for the Harambee Stars after the home defence failed to deal with a long throw in the 96th minute.
Former Manchester United coach McCarthy was in the thick of celebrations on the sidelines, but the point left Kenya six points behind Group F leaders Gabon, with The Gambia two points further back.
Libya had pulled off something of a coup by convincing Cisse to take charge of their campaign, and the former Senegal boss was minutes away from a perfect start against Angola in a raucous Benghazi.
Murad Al Wuheeshi made a couple of impressive saves for the hosts in the first half and Muaid Ellafi's well-placed header back across goal put the Mediterranean Knights ahead in the 74th minute.
That goal was set to take Libya top of Group D, but Angola equalised when an under-pressure Al Wuheeshi was unable to keep out Fredy's free-kick at his near post three minutes into stoppage time.
Libya instead remain third in the table two points adrift of Cape Verde, with Angola a point further behind the Blue Sharks.

Jordan Ayew says he ""believes in destiny"" after being named captain of Ghana for this month's 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.
The Leicester City forward will lead the Black Stars under a revamped national team structure which includes Winfried Schafer as technical advisor of the Ghana Football Association.
Football runs deep in the Ayew family, with both Jordan's father Abedi Pele and brother Andre Ayew having previously captained the four-time continental champions.
Jordan Ayew feels ""honoured"" and ""proud"" to continue that legacy.
""It’s just something that was written in the stars,"" he told BBC Sport Africa.
""We're just a passionate family. We just want to do our best [and] let the people enjoy our game.""
The 33-year-old takes over the armband from his elder sibling, who was left out of the squad by head coach Otto Addo for Group I games against Chad and Madagascar.
Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey, Andre's former deputy, returns to the squad after missing 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in November.
""I’m not someone who thinks about [being] captain or [a] leadership role,"" Ayew explained.
""I just want to enjoy playing football, winning games, scoring goals and making people happy.
""There was lot of talks and I was always quiet in my corner. I don't focus on all those things. It just happened naturally.""

The Ayew brothers played together for Ghana at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar
Since making his debut as a teenager in 2010, Jordan Ayew has been a key member of the Black Stars set-up with over 100 senior caps for Ghana.
His brother Andre, now 35 and playing in France for Le Havre, is the country's most capped player with 120 appearances.
Jordan acknowledges the ""responsibilities"" that comes with the captaincy, admitting that leading Ghana demands ""work"".
""Andre and [I] are very close - he congratulated me and give me some advice. Asamoah [Gyan] as well,"" he said.
""I’ve learned from the best - whether is Asamoah [or] Andre. I'll try and pick up things from their qualities.
""I'll keep on taking advices and things that made me grow to become who I am today.""
Ayew has been instrumental in Ghana's 2026 World Cup qualification campaign, scoring a hat-trick against the Central African Republic in Kumasi in June last year.
With four goals in the qualifiers, he is Ghana's top scorer, trailing only Egypt pair Mohamed Salah and Trezeguet, who have five goals apiece after four rounds.
""Since I've been in the national team I'm still the same today,"" Ayew said.
""When I'm myself, I am at my best. When I'm not myself, then I become unproductive.""
Ghana will miss this year's Africa Cup of Nations finals in Morocco - the first time the West Africans will be absent from the tournament since 2004 - after finishing bottom of Group F in a winless campaign.
However, the Black Stars picked up nine points from their first four Group I outings in World Cup preliminaries, and Ayew remains optimistic that the team's transition period can bring ""positive"" results.
""There's pressure playing for Ghana,"" he said.
""We can't stop people from criticism - it's part of the game.
""When the results are not there, the manager and the players get the backlash.""
With Ghana boasting Premier League stars such as Partey, Mohammed Kudus and Antoine Semenyo, Ayew insists the team must secure qualification for next year's World Cup finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada.
""As professional players, [we] need to have the mentality and strength to stand up for the challenge,"" Ayew said.
""Hopefully, from these two games, we can show a good image of ourselves and turn things around.""

BBC News, Port Sudan
Wycliffe Muia
BBC News","The Sudanese army says it has recaptured the presidential palace in the capital Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after almost two years of fighting.
Reclaiming the east African country's seat of power marks a major victory for the army, which has been making significant advances against the RSF in recent months.
""There will be no negotiations until these people are no more,"" vowed Sudan's de facto president and army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Friday.
But his troops are still a long way from ending the war entirely, with large parts of the country still under the RSF's control.
It is also unclear whether the battle for Khartoum is over: an RSF statement said its fighters were still in the area.
""Our valiant forces are still present in the vicinity of the area,"" read an RSF statement issued on the messaging service Telegram.
RSF said a drone strike it launched on the palace complex left numerous dead - including a team of journalists from Sudan's state TV station and two of the army's senior media liaison officers.
Bloody clashes are also expected to carry on as the army tries to corner remaining fighters, who occupy swathes of territory to the south of the palace.
They also control parts of the nearby airport.
However, the capture of the palace - which came after fierce battles in the centre of the city - was marked with joyful posts by soldiers on social media. Posts showed jubilant soldiers cheering and kneeling to pray at the entrance.
Nabil Abdallah, the army spokesperson, said on state TV that the military had taken control of the palace and ministry buildings on Friday morning.
""Our forces completely destroyed the enemy's fighters and equipment, and seized large quantities of equipment and weapons,"" Abdallah added.
People in the capital - where some of the biggest battles of the last two years have been fought - are still reeling from life under the RSF soldiers, who have been accused of widespread looting and human rights abuses.
Residents say they feel relieved and safe now that the territory has been taken back by the army.
Some have been saying that they would finally be able to sleep at night.
The conflict, which began in April 2023, has taken a huge toll on civilians, with 12 million people forced from their homes and millions facing famine.
The capital is not the only place the Sudanese Armed Forces have been making gains: the army has also taken parts of central Sudan in recent weeks.
But this does not represent an end to the war as the RSF still controls large areas of the country, particularly in the western Darfur region.
In a video recording on Saturday, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, had vowed to defend the presidential palace and surrounding areas that are under the control of his paramilitary group.
He also threatened further attacks in several northern cities.
Several peace efforts have collapsed as the rival forces pledge to continue fighting to control strategic areas.
As well as causing the world's largest humanitarian crisis, according to the UN, both the RSF and the army have been accused of widespread human rights abuses.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vy2x04pepo,"Ethiopia does not want war with Eritrea, says PM",2025-03-20T12:27:56.657Z,"Teklemariam Bekit
Editor, BBC Tigrinya","Landlocked Ethiopia has no intention of starting a war with neighbouring Eritrea in order to gain access to the sea, the country's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has said.
A previous statement, in 2023, that having a seaport was an ""existential issue"" for the nation sparked concerns that the Ethiopia could take one by force.
Abiy's comments to parliament on Thursday came amid fresh concerns that the neighbours, which have had a fractious relationship in the past, could be involved in a conflict again.
The prime minister said the issue of sea access for the world's most populous landlocked nation should be resolved through diplomacy and mutual benefit.
""Our intention is to negotiate based on the principle of give and take. What the Eritrean people need is development, not conflict. Our plan is not to fight but to work together and grow together,"" he said.
Nevertheless, he stressed that discussions around a seaport should not be taboo and that global norms support the idea that large nations require maritime access.
In recent weeks, there have been fears that the war in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region could resume, possibly with the involvement of Eritrea.
A two-year civil war, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, came to an end in November 2022, but elements of the peace deal have started to fray as politicians in Tigray have fallen out.
There have been accusations that Eritrea is interfering in the region's internal political divisions.
Last Thursday, Tigray's Interim President Getachew Reda accused his rivals of colluding with Eritrea, which previously supported the Ethiopian federal government during the civil war.
""We have reason to believe external actors are involved,"" Getachew said, alleging that Eritrea sees turmoil in Tigray as an opportunity for its own interests.
However, Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh dismissed these allegations, telling diplomats in the capital, Asmara, on Tuesday that his country ""categorically rejects"" any claims that it is involved in northern Ethiopia's tensions.
But last week Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Gedion Timotewos told diplomats in Addis Ababa that his government suspects one of the factions in Tigray has links to Eritrea, though he did not provide specific details.
Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia in the 1990s, which resulted in Ethiopia losing direct access to the sea.
From 1998, the countries fought a two-year border war. Relations were finally normalised in 2018, after Abiy came to power in Ethiopia, but many of the changes that that brought about have since been reversed.

BBC News, Addis Ababa","Dozens of passengers on a bus in Ethiopia have been abducted by armed men in the country's largest region, Oromia, as they were were travelling from the capital, Addis Ababa.
Details are only just emerging of the kidnappings, which took place earlier this week.
The incident happened in Ali Doro, which is near an area where around 100 university students were similarly abducted as they were heading home from their campus last July.
Survivors and local authorities blamed those abductions on the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), a rebel group that operates in the area. The group denied involvement at the time.
Referring to this week's incident, the OLA has said it had received reports of the abductions and that it was ""conducting an investigation"".
According to one report by a local media organisation, the passengers were heading to Debre Markos, a town in the country's Amhara region, when they were attacked by the armed men, who exchanged fire with local security forces.
Another report said several buses were attacked, during which at least one person died. The number of abductees could be as high as 50, according to this report.
The government has not yet said anything about the kidnappings, and the BBC's attempts to get an official response have been unsuccessful.
Abductions of civilians - including passengers - have become increasingly common in the area. Armed groups here have in the past demanded ransoms for the release of the people they hold.
The OLA says it is fighting for the self-determination of Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo.
It has been classified as a terrorist organisation by the federal parliament and operates in various areas in Oromia, including the district where Ali Doro is located.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjypjlx4nko,Nigeria's president declares emergency in oil-rich state,2025-03-19T14:26:32.410Z,"Azeezat Olaoluwa in Lagos & Danai Nesta Kupemba in London
BBC News","Nigeria is facing an escalating political crisis after President Bola Tinubu declared a state of emergency in the oil-rich Rivers state and suspended the governor, his deputy and all lawmakers in the state parliament for six months.
In a nationwide broadcast on Tuesday evening Tinubu said he had received ""disturbing security reports detailing incidents of vandalisation of pipelines by some militants without the governor taking any action to curtail them"".
He added that he could not allow the ""grave situation"" to continue.
But lawyers and opposition politicians are questioning the legality of the president's decision.
Tinubu made the announcement after one of the country's highest producing crude oil pipelines, the Trans-Niger Pipeline, suffered significant damage due to a blast.
Attacks on pipelines have in the past been carried out by criminal gangs or militants, halting production and exports.
At current prices, the oil flowing through the affected pipeline fetches around $14m (£11m) a day, according to the online publication Africa Report.
But against the backdrop of the blast, there has been a political rift in Rivers state that has reached boiling point.
Governor Siminalayi Fubara is a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) which has been plagued by reports of in-fighting. At a national level, the PDP is the main party opposed to the president's All Progressives Congress.
Tinubu said that politicians have not been able to work together effectively because of the ongoing turmoil. He alleged that allies of Fubara had threatened ""fire and brimstone"" against the governor's enemies and that they had not ""disowned"" these comments.
Rivers state lawmakers had threatened to impeach the governor and his deputy, according to Reuters news agency.
Tinubu said this political crisis has left Rivers state at a ""standstill"" adding that this latest measure is based on the need to restore peace and order to the state.
Fubara gave a measured response to the state of emergency.
He said there have been ""political disagreements, but good governance has continued"".
""Rivers state is safe, secure and peaceful under our watch,"" he said.
The state of emergency will allow the government to run the state in the interim and send security forces if needed.
But many groups see Tinubu's action as draconian.
The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) said it was ""unconstitutional"" to remove an elected governor, deputy governor, or members of a state's legislature.
The PDP rejected the emergency rule, calling it an attempt at ""state capture"". It accused Tinubu of trying to turn Nigeria into a one-party country.
""It is the climax of a well-oiled plot to forcefully take over Rivers state,"" it said.
Peter Obi, a former presidential candidate for the Labour Party, criticised the move which he described as ""reckless"" on X.
This is not the first time a state of emergency has been declared in Nigeria. Former presidents resorted to the action in a bid to curb insurgency and instability in different parts of the country.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4ypgp9eg3o,Ghana journalist awarded $18m in US after suing ex-MP,2025-03-19T11:29:07.904Z,"Thomas Naadi & Natasha Booty
BBC News","A US court awarded Ghanaian investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas $18m (£14m) in damages, after a jury said he was defamed by former Ghanaian MP Kennedy Agyapong.
The case stems from comments Agyapong made about Anas after his BBC investigation in 2018 that exposed football corruption in Ghana and elsewhere.
The court heard that Agyapong, among other accusations made on a podcast, had called the reporter a ""criminal"" and alleged he was behind the murder of fellow journalist Ahmed Suale.
Anas lost a similar legal action in Ghana seven years ago. But after the release of the podcast episode in 2021 Anas went to court in the US state of New Jersey where Agyapong has a property.
The politician was in New Jersey when he was interviewed for the Daddy Fred Show podcast, according to court papers filed by his lawyers.
Last week's initial verdict was confirmed on Tuesday. The $18m in damages was the result of a unanimous decision by an eight-member jury in Essex County Superior Court in New Jersey, finding Agyapong liable for defamation.
The figure included $8m in punitive damages.
""Justice has prevailed. This victory is not just for me, but for truth, press freedom, and every journalist who risks everything to expose corruption and wrongdoing,"" Anas said in response.
""No amount of intimidation or falsehood will silence the pursuit of accountability even in the face of assassination. Our work continues, undeterred and unafraid.""
The journalist, who has won multiple international awards for his reporting, has vowed to continue fighting corruption and holding wrongdoers accountable.
Agyapong's lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that the case should not have been brought in the US in the first place. They also said that the comments made on the podcast were the kinds of things other courts had described as hyperbole and opinion and were not subject to a defamation case.
Meanwhile, police in Ghana have arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Anas' colleague, Ahmed Hussein Suale, who was killed in 2019.
The suspect allegedly shared pictures of the undercover journalist with a popular Ghanaian politician before his death.
The death of Ahmed was also linked to a football corruption exposé.
The investigation sought to expose corruption in African football and was reported by BBC Africa Eye.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mn21km5rlo,DR Congo and Rwanda call for ceasefire in Qatar talks,2025-03-19T08:20:48.241Z,"Wycliffe Muia
BBC News","The Democratic Republic of Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame have called for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in eastern DR Congo, after having direct talks in Qatar.
It is the first time two leaders have met since Rwanda-backed M23 rebels stepped up an offensive in the region, where authorities say 7,000 people have been killed since January.
It is unclear whether the M23 would heed the ceasefire call, after the rebels refused to attend peace talks in Angola on Tuesday.
DR Congo accuses Rwanda of arming the M23 and sending troops to support the rebels in the conflict. Despite assertions from both the UN and US, Rwanda has denied supporting the M23.
Rwanda has said its forces are acting in self-defence against the DR Congo army and allied militias. DR Congo also accuses Rwanda of illegally exploiting its mineral deposits in the east of the country, which Rwanda also denies.
Last December, peace talks brokered by Angola collapsed after Rwanda demanded that the DR Congo government talk directly to the M23.
The rebel group then advanced swiftly, taking control of two key cities - Goma and Bukavu - in the past two months.
According to a joint statement released by Qatar's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday, the two African presidents reaffirmed their commitment to an ""immediate and unconditional"" ceasefire, but it was not clear how that would be implemented or monitored.
""The heads of state then agreed on the need to continue the discussions initiated in Doha in order to establish solid foundations for lasting peace,"" it added.
The meeting took many by surprise as the two leaders have appeared uncompromising on the conflict often exchanging barbs in public.
While confirming the talks in the Qatari capital, the Rwandan presidency insisted in a separate statement that direct talks between DR Congo and M23 were ""key to addressing the root causes of the conflict"".
President Kagame expressed his belief that with ""all parties working together, things can move forward faster"".
DR Congo presidential spokeswoman Tina Salama said on X that the talks were initiated by the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, describing the Gulf nation as a ""strategic ally of the two [African] countries"".
In a presidential statement, the Congolese government said the meeting marked the first step towards a basis for a lasting peace in the volatile east, hinting at further talks.
The meeting of the two leaders came as a previous attempt to bring DR Congo's government and M23 rebels together for peace talks failed. The rebels pulled out on Monday after the European Union announced sanctions on their leadership.

His office also rejected the cult comparison - the latest twist in a row that has gripped Nigeria, raising questions about gender equality in the socially conservative nation.
Akpoti-Uduaghan said she was being punished for speaking out against the system and that she now feared for her and her two-year-old's safety as her security detail had been stripped.
""The Nigerian Senate operates like a cult. The Senate president runs the Senate like a dictator, not a democrat. There is no freedom of speech, there is no freedom of expression and anyone who dares to go against him gets cut to size,"" the 45-year-old said in the first TV interview since her suspension.
In a statement to the BBC, the Senate's Deputy Chief Whip Onyekachi Nwebonyi said Senator Akpoti-Uduaghan was not being silenced and that ""her own legislative activities disprove this claim"".
Akpoti-Uduaghan, who represents the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), alleged that the sexual harassment started in 2023, when she visited Akpabio's country home with her husband.
She said the Akpabio ""squeezed her hand suggestively"" and said ""I will make an opportunity for us to come here and have a good moment"".
Nwebonyi, who says he was also present during the visit, stated: ""At no time during the period in question did the Senate president make any unwanted sexual advances to Senator Akpoti at his country house.""
But Akpoti-Uduaghan alleged that this was just one incident of many and that the harassment continued for several months.
She said that, while with other senators on the Senate's premises, Akpabio made a comment to the effect of: ""Natasha your husband is really enjoying, it looks like you'll be able to make good movements with your waist.""
""The Senate president said this,"" Akpoti-Uduaghan told the BBC.
""He makes very sexist statements then they [senators] all laugh. He says in the Senate we're all men, she should be used to this.""
On his part, Nwebonyi said these allegations were ""completely false"".
Nigeria has one of the lowest numbers of female parliamentarians in Africa.
Akpoti-Uduaghan one of four female senators in a parliament of 109 members and she is also the first female senator in her state.
Her petition against Akpabio was dismissed due to ""procedural errors"".
Then, on 6 March, the ethics committee handed Akpoti-Uduaghan a six-month suspension without pay, citing ""unruly and disruptive"" behaviour during a debate in the Senate.
Akpoti-Uduaghan told the BBC that she no longer had access to security as a result of the suspension.
""In the Nigerian space, we have had people over the past decades who have been killed for having strong views against the government,"" she said.
""If I'm taking my kid for a walk - because I have a two-year-old - will I be killed? Will I be attacked?""
Civil society groups in the country have expressed concerns over Akpoti-Uduaghan's treatment, calling for a transparent investigation into her allegations.
""All we can say is that today is a sad day for Nigerian women fighting for emancipation. Out of 109 senators, only four are women and one is now suspended,"" women's rights activist Hadiza Ado told the BBC when the suspension was imposed.
While rights groups and some social media users have expressed their support for Akpoti-Uduaghan, she also has her fair share of detractors.
After she was suspended, two groups of protesters gathered near parliament in the capital, Abuja - one backing the senate president and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go''.
Akpoti-Uduaghan had also been subjected to an onslaught of misogynist abuse on social media since making the allegations, she told the BBC.
The scandal is the latest episode in a political career that has been rocky from the outset.
Akpoti-Uduaghan first ran for governor of Kogi state in 2019 and alleged that her candidacy was challenged over her mixed-race heritage.
She eventually appeared on the ballot, but was subjected to physical and verbal attacks during her campaign.
In 2023, she ran for Senate and lost the election. The poll was marred by violence and after Akpoti-Uduaghan took the matter to court, the election result was overturned.
""I thought the worst was over with the elections,"" she told the BBC.
""But for a woman I guess it's never really over right? It's just different parts, different chapters.""
Akpoti-Uduaghan has taken legal action in an attempt to have her suspension overturned and plans to petition the Senate again with her sexual harassment allegations.
Despite the heavy emotional toll, she said she did not regret speaking out.
She said she feels encouraged by her husband, child and the masses of supporters outside her family, which include female politicians from other African countries.
""I have gotten calls on a daily basis from women connecting with me and telling me they are experiencing the same thing in their parliament, but that they can't speak up,"" she said.
""They say, Natasha, do this for us. This is my story and my story is that of many women in Nigeria that do not have the courage to speak up.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39v27p0mwyo,Missing South African girl was wanted for her 'eyes and skin',2025-03-18T20:42:41.297Z,"Khanyisile Ngcobo
BBC News, Johannesburg","A young South African girl who disappeared last year aged six was allegedly sought by a traditional healer for her eyes and fair complexion, a court has heard.
This is among the allegations that have emerged at the ongoing trial of Joshlin Smith's mother, Kelly Smith, who has been accused of orchestrating her kidnapping.
Ms Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn have pleaded not guilty to charges of human trafficking and kidnapping.
Joshlin's disappearance in February 2024 from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, sent shockwaves across South Africa and, despite a highly publicised search for her, she is yet to be found.
Ms Smith initially said that Joshlin, who has a fair complexion and blue-green eyes, had gone missing after she had left her in Mr Appollis's care.
Prosecutors later accused her of having ""sold, delivered or exchanged"" the six-year-old and lied about her disappearance.
The trial, which is now in its third week, is being held at a community centre in Saldanha.
During the first week of the trial, the court heard details about the day Joshlin went missing, including that Ms Smith only alerted the police more than six hours after she had first noticed that the young girl had disappeared.
The court also heard that she appeared calm during the frantic search and seemed more concerned about her boyfriend's whereabouts than the missing child.
More shocking claims emerged in the second week.
A local pastor said that as far back as 2023, he had heard Ms Smith - a mother of three - talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; £850) each, though she had said she was willing to accept a lower figure of $275.
Joshlin's teacher then alleged in court that Ms Smith had told her during the search that her daughter was already ""on a ship, inside a container, and they were on the way to West Africa"".
These revelations paled in comparison to the explosive details made by Lourentia Lombaard, a friend and neighbour of Ms Smith, who turned state witness.
She took the stand last Thursday and, over three days, detailed the events in the lead up to Joshlin's disappearance that involved a traditional healer, known in South Africa as a ""sangoma"".
Ms Lombaard alleged that her friend confessed to her: ""I did something silly... I sold my child to a sangoma"", adding that she had been driven by a desperate need for money.
Joshlin's mother promised those who knew of the plan some money in return for their silence, Ms Lombaard said.
She told the court that she later witnessed Ms Smith pack some clothes for Joshlin into a black bag, which she then saw her carry as the two walked to meet a woman Ms Lombaard believes was the sangoma.
Mother and daughter got into a white car and drove away with the woman, Ms Lombaard said.
Speaking on Monday, her last day on the stand, Ms Lombaard told the court that the ""person who [allegedly took] Joshlin wanted her for her eyes and skin"".
It was not made clear in court why a sangoma would want a child like this.
A woman believed to be a traditional healer was initially arrested and charged alongside Ms Smith and her co-accused last year, but the charges against her were eventually dropped because of a lack of evidence.
Sangomas are legally recognised in South Africa under the Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007, alongside herbalists, traditional birth attendants and traditional surgeons.
It is believed that ancestral spirits are able to provide advice and healing through these culturally respected practitioners.
Some charlatans are involved in unscrupulous traditional so-called cures, and have been known to sell good luck charms that involve body parts.
Ms Lombaard expressed sorrow over her role in Joshlin's disappearance, saying that she had tried, without success, to stop Ms Smith from selling her daughter.
She appealed to whoever had taken the young girl to ""please bring her back alive"".
The trial is expected to run until 28 March.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0xl8gp14o,Last-minute deal to protect African penguins from extinction,2025-03-18T15:59:08.802Z,"Gabby Colenso
BBC News, Cape Town","Six key breeding areas are to be safeguarded to help save the African penguin, following a landmark court order in South Africa.
Last year scientists warned that the species was declining by around 8% every year and could become extinct within a decade.
The court has imposed no-fishing zones around the breeding colonies to prevent so-called purse seine fishing vessels, which use large nets, from catching sardines and anchovies for the next 10 years.
The order is the result of an out-of-court settlement reached before a three-day High Court hearing was due to start between conservation groups, the commercial fishing industry and the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE).
Last year, BirdLife South Africa and the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (Sanccob) started the legal action - the first case of its kind in South Africa.
They alleged that ministers had failed to adequately protect the endangered species after failing to implement key recommendations from a scientific panel brought in by the government to assess the risk to the African penguin.
They argued the continuation of ""inadequate"" interim closures to fishing vessels around the breeding colonies, which are mainly in the Western Cape, had been allowed.
The Biodiversity Law Centre, which represents the groups, said the number of penguins had dwindled from 15,000 in 2018 to just under 9,000 at the end of 2023.
It said if the current rates of decline persisted the African penguin could be extinct by 2035.
The order, issued by the Pretoria High Court on Tuesday, outlines no-go zones for the commercial sardine and anchovy fishing vessels around six key African penguin breeding colonies: Dassen Island, Robben Island, Stony Point, Dyer Island, St Croix Island and Bird Island.
The DFFE has two weeks to make sure the permit conditions and the closures are implemented.
Nicky Stander, head of conservation at Sanccob, said the journey was far from over.
""The threats facing the African penguin are complex and ongoing - and the order itself requires monitoring, enforcement and continued co-operation from industry and the government processes which monitor and allocate sardine and anchovy populations for commercial purposes,"" she said.
The anchovy and sardine fishing industry said it was pleased an agreement had been made, saying the decision was halfway between the interim closures and the area closures requested by conservation groups.
It also added that the perception that the fishing industry was the primary cause of the decline of the penguin population was false.
The order will last for the next 10 years, bringing it to 2035 which is when scientists predicted the penguin would be extinct.
Its progress will be reviewed six years from now.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c871q33yvjpo,Nigeria and Kenya among nations running out of HIV drugs - WHO,2025-03-18T14:55:59.129Z,"Wycliffe Muia
BBC News, Nairobi","Eight countries - six of them in Africa, including Nigeria, Kenya and Lesotho - could soon run out of HIV drugs following the US government's recent decision to pause foreign aid, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said.
US President Donald Trump announced the freeze on his first day in office in January as part of a review into government spending.
""Disruptions to HIV programmes could undo 20 years of progress,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned.
It could also lead to more than 10 million additional cases of HIV and three million HIV-related deaths, he added, noting this was ""more than triple the number of deaths last year"".
Nigeria, Kenya, Lesotho, South Sudan, Burkina Faso and Mali - as well as Haiti and Ukraine - would run out of live-saving anti-retroviral (ARV) medicines in the coming months, Dr Tedros said at a press conference on Monday.
Trump's executive order paused foreign aid support for an initial duration of 90 days in line with his ""America First"" foreign policy.
It has affected health programmes around the world, leaving shipments of critical medical supplies, including HIV drugs, greatly hampered.
The majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes have since been terminated.
Despite a waiver issued in February for the US's ground-breaking HIV programme, its work has severely impacted.
Known as the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), it relies on logistical support from USAID and other organisations hit by the turmoil.
It has led to the ""immediate stop to services for HIV treatment, testing and prevention in more than 50 countries"", Dr Tedros said.
Launched in 2003, Pepfar has enabled some of the world's poorest people to access anti and has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives worldwide.
During his first days in office, Trump also announced that the US would pull out of the WHO, affecting funding for the global health agency.
""The US administration has been extremely generous over many years. And of course, it's within its rights to decide what it supports and to what extent,"" Dr Tedros said.
""But the US also has a responsibility to ensure that if it withdraws direct funding for countries, it's done in an orderly and humane way that allows them to find alternative sources of funding.
An estimated 25 million people are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which is more than two-thirds of the global total 38 million people living with the disease.
In Nigeria, nearly two million people are living with HIV, with many relying on receiving aid-funded medicines.
Kenya has the seventh-largest number of people living with HIV in the world, at around 1.4 million, according to WHO data.
""We ask the US to reconsider its support for global health, which not only saves lives around the world, it also makes the US safer by preventing outbreaks from spreading internationally,"" Dr Tedros said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8ywlk8n4yo,'No-one can handle another war' - Tigrayans fear fresh Ethiopian conflict,2025-03-17T21:55:09.882Z,"Kalkidan Yibeltal
BBC News, Mekelle","People living in Mekelle, the main city in Ethiopia's war-scarred Tigray, have told the BBC they fear they could soon be dragged into conflict again.
Growing tensions threaten the fragile peace agreement signed in late 2022, which brought an end to a brutal civil war that claimed an estimated half a million lives.
Many here are preparing for the worst - either leaving for the federal capital, Addis Ababa, on sold-out flights, or stocking up on emergency supplies and withdrawing their savings from the bank.
""It's all because of the anxiety,"" one resident said.
Tseganesh Kassa, an ex-combatant from Shire, a city in central Tigray, badly wounded her leg during the war. She now walks on crutches and requires regular medical treatment.
She says war ""rocked my family"".
""I am now a disabled person and my family has been [ruined] economically. I don't want to see that again. Displaced people living in makeshift camps haven't even been returned to their homes.
""No-one can handle another [war].""
Tigray was the epicentre of the conflict.
The guns were silenced when two of the main warring groups, Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the leading political party in the region, signed a peace agreement.
This led to the formation of an interim administration tasked with running the region until elections were held. But in recent months there has been a growing power struggle between senior figures within TPLF and Tigray's interim administration.
The administration accuses certain TPLF politicians of attempting to seize power by force.
Some within the TPLF accuse the interim administration's leadership of failing to support ex-fighters or bring back people displaced by the war.
Territories that were once under Tigray's administration before the fighting but are now are under others' control is also a hot issue.
Both sides accuse each other of engaging in treasonous activities that involve ""external actors"".
There are now concerns the peace agreement could unravel, and even fears over the prospect of a direct conflict between Ethiopia and its neighbour Eritrea.
During the Tigray war, Ethiopia's government was supported by Eritrea. But relations have deteriorated between the two countries since the peace deal, which Eritrea did not sign.
Since then, there seems to be a feeling in Eritrea that it has become the fall guy for the atrocities reportedly committed during the war.
All parties were accused of gross abuses during the civil war - including the mass killing of civilians and widespread sexual violence. Eritrean soldiers were particularly accused of being behind the deaths dozens of the civilians in the historic city of Aksum.
Tigray's interim administration says Eritrean troops are still occupying parts of the region's land along shared borders where they continue to commit abuses.
Meanwhile Eritrea's information minister called the allegations ""fabricated"" adding the areas in question are ""Eritrean sovereign territories"".
Tigrayan officials want the return of these and other disputed areas currently under the control of forces from neighbouring Amhara region, as outlined in the peace deal.
Ethiopia's ambitions to have access to the sea is another factor souring relations with Eritrea.
There are fears that the two neighbours could return to war six years after they mended their fraught relations.
If violence returns to Tigray - or if clashes break out between Ethiopia and Eritrea - the implications will far reaching in an already volatile region.
In Mekelle, residents are weary of the prospect of further conflict.
""The youths are tired of violence,"" Tesfay Gebreabgzi, a shoe-shiner in his 20s, tells the BBC. ""During the [civil] war, lots of people had the desire to fight. Now there's only fatigue.""
Haimanot Gebremariam, a vegetable vendor in her 50s, says her two children joined the fighting on the Tigrayan side after war broke out in 2020.
But while her daughter returned safely, her son sustained permanent wounds. She says she does not want to see a return to ""the dark days"". The situation now ""is very concerning"", she tells the BBC.
""We still live with the trauma and the scar of the previous war. We don't want to shed tears again.""
The Tigray region has not fully recovered from the disastrous impact of the conflict.
Nearly a million displaced people have still not returned home and some key infrastructure — including schools and health facilities - have not yet been rebuilt.
Nonetheless, despite the palpable anxiety, there is a semblance of normality in Mekelle. Businesses and shops are working regularly. And there is not a heavy presence of security forces on the streets.
But having lived through one of Africa's deadliest conflicts in recent memory, many are closely following every small development.
In one coffee house, young people are glued to their phones, watching clips from recent press statements made by the head of Tigray's interim administration, Getachew Reda, who is currently hundreds of miles away in Addis Ababa for ""consultations"" with federal authorities.
In another cafe, a young man said he was waiting to hear what the city's new mayor - who was appointed on Thursday by the dissident TPLF faction - would do to calm the public.
Everyone, it seems, is waiting to see what the next days and weeks will bring.

BBC News","Opposition parties in South Africa have called on its president not to be ""bullied"" by the US after Washington expelled Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool, giving him just 72 hours to leave the country.
Rasool was declared an unwelcome person after US State Secretary Marco Rubio called him a ""race-baiting politician who hates America"" on Friday.
Tensions between South African and the US have been on a downward spiral since US President Donald Trump came into office.
However, South Africa's Minister of International Relations Ronald Lamola told public broadcaster SABC that ""it is not helpful to engage in Twitter diplomacy"", saying the two countries need to talk ""face-to-face"".
Other politicians were less measured in their response.
Julius Malema's opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party issued a scathing statement against the US, calling on South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa ""to not allow the country to be bullied by the orange clown occupying the White House"".
Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) Secretary General Apa Pooe also condemned the US decision, calling it an attack on South Africa's sovereignty and an attempt to dictate policy in the country.
""SA is not a puppet of the US, we have the right to govern our country without any interference,"" he said.
Trump has been a vocal critic of South Africa's controversial land law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.
Last month, Trump cut aid to South Africa. He alleged there was discrimination against the white Afrikaner minority, descendants of Dutch and French settlers.
South Africa denies this.
Rasool previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.
He was appointed as ambassador again in 2024, because of his previous experience and extensive network of Washington contacts.
But despite his record, he has faced challenges setting up meetings with Trump.
One unnamed South African diplomat told news site Semafor that someone with the ambassador's ""history of pro-Palestine politics"", among other things, ""is not likely to do well in that job right now"".
The Democratic Alliance (DA) - a coalition partner in South Africa's government of national unity (GNU) - has questioned why the largest party, the African National Congress (ANC), was still choosing all its foreign diplomats.
""It is simply just not right that the ANC has got carte blanche on foreign policy and the appointments of diplomats while they are only a 39% party,"" DA spokesperson Willie Aucamp told SABC, as he called for members of the GNU to be allowed to go to Washington to ease tensions.

BBC News","Angola is under fire after it denied entry to several senior African political figures set to attend a conference hosted by the country's main opposition party.
Unita said it had invited the politicians, including Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu, Mozambique's Venancio Mondlane and Botswana's former President Ian Khama, to a summit on democracy.
""The action of the Angolan government to prevent us from entering Angola is inexplicable and unacceptable,"" Lissu said on X.
The BBC has asked the Angolan government to comment.
But according to a source from the Migration and Aliens Service (SME), ""the expulsion was due to irregularities in the visa procedure, which prevented Mondlane and 13 other members of his entourage from entering Angolan territory"".
Mondlane, who has called for nationwide protests over what he says were rigged elections last year, was this week subjected to travel restrictions in his home country.
At least 20 leaders and representatives from various political parties across Africa were denied entry, said Lissu.
""The government of this country is ruling a dictatorship while pretending that Angola is a democratic country,"" he said.
Lissu is a vocal critic of the Tanzanian government and head of the main opposition party, Chadema. He survived an assassination attempt in 2017 and has spent several years in exile.
Kenyan senator Edwin Sifuna, from the opposition Orange Democratic Movement, said on X he was among those denied entry into Angola.
Delegates from Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Sudan who had visas or were eligible for visa on arrival were deported, the Platform for African Democrats (Pad), a group of opposition parties across Africa, said in a statement.
Khama, Colombia's former President Andres Pastrana, Zanzibar's first Vice-President Othman Masoud Othman and 24 others were detained at the airport for nine hours with no explanation. They were released but missed their connecting flights, according to Pad.
The Angolan government promised to make up for these actions by providing a plane, but it never materialised, the opposition grouping said.
Zanzibar's main opposition party, ACT Wazalendo, urged the Tanzanian government to immediately summon the Angolan ambassador to provide a formal explanation of why the party's vice-president was denied entry to the country.
Tomas Viera Mario, a Mozambican political analyst, told the BBC the move was ""strange"" as Angola's President Joao Lourenco has positioned himself as a kind of mediator on the continent.
Lourenco is currently the chair of the African Union (AU), and is hosting peace talks over the DR Congo conflict next week.
Mr Mario added that barring these figures showed ""total contempt and ""little respect"" for the pan-African spirit of the AU.
All the deported leaders were part of a delegation invited by Unita to attend its 59th anniversary celebrations in Benguela province.
Unita lawmaker Nelito da Costa Ekwiki also condemned the decision not to allow them entry to the country.
The Angolan government has long been accused of shutting down dissent in order to maintain its hold on power.

BBC News, Nairobi","Sudan has suspended all imports from Kenya in protest after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are fighting the army in a two-year civil war, were hosted in Nairobi.
Last month, the RSF and its allied political and armed groups signed a founding charter in Kenya expressing the intention to form a parallel government in Sudan.
Sudan's military government said the import ban was to preserve the country's sovereignty and ""protect its national security"".
The war-torn country imports several products from Kenya including tea, food items and pharmaceutical products.
""The import of all products coming from Kenya through all ports, crossings, airports, and ports will be suspended as of this day until further notice,"" a decree issued by Sudan's ministry of trade stated.
It ordered ""all relevant authorities to enforce the ban immediately"".
Tensions between Kenya and Sudan have been escalating for several months.
Kenyan President William Ruto has faced widespread criticism at home for his perceived close ties with the RSF.
Last month, Sudan recalled its ambassador to Kenya in protest against Nairobi's involvement in a ""conspiracy to establish a government"" for the RSF.
Sudan called Kenya's hosting of RSF meetings ""tantamount to an act of hostility"".
But Kenya defended its role, stating that hosting the meetings was part of efforts to find solutions to end the war in Sudan ""without any ulterior motives"".
Both countries have traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations, with Kenya being an important partner for Sudan, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing.
Kenya exports a range of goods to Sudan, with tea being its most significant export, followed by coffee, tobacco, and other products such as soaps, electrical equipment, and pharmaceuticals.
Tea is one of Kenya's most significant foreign exchange earners, and this move is expected to disrupt both trade flows and the broader economy.
""This ban will be a big blow, and foreign exchange will take a hit. It would mean less foreign exchange and greater exposure to financial services. It has a ripple effect that extends beyond just trade,"" economist Ken Gichinga told the BBC.
Sudan is one of the top five destinations for Kenyan tea and producers are worried about the effects of the ban.
The East African Tea Trade Association (EATTA) expressed concerns over ongoing contracts and shipments stuck in transit.
""Teas are currently at Port Sudan, and several containers already dispatched are now stranded in the high seas,"" it said.
Large stocks in Kenya's port city of Mombasa also cannot be shipped out.
""This will result in unfathomable losses incurred by buyers and will trickle down to producers and farmers,"" the association warned.
RSF advisor El Basha Tebeig sought to reassure Kenya, stating on X that the group would ""guarantee the smooth passage of Kenyan goods into Sudan"" in those areas it controls.
But Port Sudan is in the hands of the army and has become the seat of the military government because of the fighting in Khartoum.
The Kenyan government is yet to comment but Agriculture Minister Mutahi Kagwe recently said his country was exploring diplomatic avenues to address the market access challenges in Sudan.
Kenya's tea exports to Sudan have already been affected by the conflict there.
A recent report showed a 12% reduction in Kenyan tea exports to Sudan over the past year.
The war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, has caused widespread destruction, disrupting supply chains and limiting the ability of businesses to operate normally.
Ports and border crossings, vital for trade, have been either damaged or obstructed by the violence, significantly reducing the flow of goods between Sudan and its neighbours, including Kenya.
The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including the capital Khartoum - with thousands of people killed and more than 12 million displaced, according to the United Nations.

BBC News, Nairobi","A British man has been killed in a hit-and-run incident involving a vehicle in the motorcade of Kenyan President William Ruto.
The man, who has been named as 79-year-old Edgar Riches, died on Thursday after being struck in the accident on a main road in the capital, Nairobi.
Police detained a driver, who has since been released on bail.
They say he was driving a support vehicle that was travelling at the rear of President Ruto's official convoy.
According to the police, the president's detail had passed by the time the accident occurred.
Police spokesman Michael Muchiri told the BBC that Mr Riches had been visiting Kenya to see his sister and nephew who are residents of the country.
Kenya's police initially gave his name as Edgar Charles Frederick - using his middle names.
A post-mortem found he had suffered multiple trauma, including severe injuries to the chest and head.
He was a charity worker from Poole in Dorset, who had regularly raised money for projects Kenya.
The police said the driver, who failed to stop after the incident, would appear in court following an investigation.
There has been an uproar on social media following Thursday's incident.
While Kenyans are accustomed to roads being cleared for the presidential motorcade, this time around some have questioned why the convoy was so big and moving at such speed.
This not the first time a president's or deputy president's motorcade has killed or injured a pedestrian, and in a number of cases, members of the president's travelling party have died.
But some believe more attention is being paid to this latest case because the victim is a foreigner.
A spokesperson for the UK High Commission said officials were aware of the reports and were seeking more information.
Videos posted on social media show a man in blue jeans and a light-coloured shirt lying bleeding on the road outside a busy shopping area.
Other pictures show the victim covered in a checked shawl, known locally as a Maasai Shuka.
Mr Muchiri told the BBC the vehicle belonged to the regional administration and was providing support to the presidential detail.
President Ruto held events in the vicinity of the scene on Thursday as part of ongoing political engagements with the public in the capital.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c778kp7k14ko,Rival forces seize mayor's office in key Ethiopian town amid fears of new conflict,2025-03-14T09:27:06.368Z,"Kalkidan Yibeltal
BBC News, Mekelle","A dissident faction of the main political party in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray has seized control of key offices and a radio station in the regional capital, Mekelle, amid growing fears of a fresh conflict.
It follows a deepening power struggle within the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which has raised concerns of a return to civil war.
One Mekelle resident told the BBC that people were withdrawing money from their bank accounts, fearing the security situation could deteriorate.
On Tuesday, the same faction took control of Adigrat, Tigray's second-largest city.
Getachew Reda, president of Tigray's interim administration, has accused the rival group, led by Debretsion Gebremichael, of attempting to forcefully remove him from office.
Getachew became Tigray's leader following a 2022 peace deal ending two years of conflict in the region, which killed an estimated 500,000 people.
Debretsion Gebremichael was previously the region's leader but over the past year, relations have soured with the man who replaced him.
On Thursday, members of Debretsion's faction accompanied by armed soldiers took control of Mekelle FM radio station and the mayor's office in the city.
Gunshots were heard on Wednesday night in Adi-Gudem, a town near Mekelle, when forces from the dissident faction attempted to occupy a government building.
The forces reportedly arrested the town's mayor and took control of the office.
Getachew has suspended three generals of the Tigray Defence Forces, accusing the rival faction of trying to destabilise the region.
On Wednesday, Getachew asked the Ethiopian government to ""provide necessary assistance"", without specifying the kind of support.
He is currently in the country's capital Addis Ababa for ""consultations with the federal authorities"" but he told the BBC that he intends to return to Tigray.
Federal authorities in Ethiopia have not yet commented.
In a press statement on Thursday, Getachew accused his rivals of colluding with neighbouring Eritrea, which was involved in Tigray's civil war and has a fractious relationship with Ethiopia's government.
""We have reason to believe external actors are involved,"" he said, accusing Eritrea of being among those who think ""they would benefit from turmoil in Tigray"".
Eritrea denies any such intention but its army fought in the previous war, where it was accused of mass killings and rape.
Two close allies of Debretsion have rejected the accusation they are linked to Eritrea, and downplayed the possibility of another round of conflict.
Speaking to the BBC's Newsday programme, Getachew accused high-ranking Tigrayan military officers of attempting to orchestrate an ""open coup"".
The tensions have sparked fresh anxiety in the region, which is yet to recover from the conflict that ended in 2022 after the TPLF and the Ethiopian government signed a peace deal.
The agreement led to the creation of the interim administration, which is supposed to govern Tigray until regional elections are held.
But delays in implementing the agreement have fuelled sharp divisions within the TPLF.
Several countries including the US, Britain and the European Union have warned about the escalating tension, saying there must be ""no return to violence"".
On Thursday, France called on its nationals in Tigray to ""stock up on emergency supplies and to exercise utmost caution"".
In a statement, the African Union said it was following events in Tigray with ""deep concern"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5gl25756o,'They killed all these young people' - BBC investigates alleged massacre in rebel-held Congolese city,2025-03-14T00:44:01.085Z,"Orla Guerin
BBC News, Goma","Freddy Mukuza's final moments were witnessed by a friend, who stood helpless, 50m (160 ft) away.
When he heard that Freddy had been shot - by M23 rebels he was told - he and others rushed to the scene in Goma, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
""When we arrived, we found Freddy still breathing, and wanted to take him away, but the M23 did not allow us,"" says the friend, who we are calling Justin.
""When we insisted, they fired bullets into the ground as if to say: 'If you dare cross this perimeter, we will kill you as well.'""
So they had to keep their distance, as Freddy, 31, took his last breath. Only then did the M23 allow them to approach and take away his body.
Shortly before the killing, three pick-up trucks full of rebel fighters had come to Freddy's neighbourhood - Kasika.
It was around 15:00 on Saturday 22 February - almost a month after the rebel group had captured Goma in a rapid advance through the east of the country.
Within an hour or so, between 17 and 22 people had been killed, mostly young men, according to our sources.
We have gathered detailed accounts from residents, who cannot be identified, for their own protection.
We asked the M23 for a response to the allegation that they carried out a mass killing in the neighbourhood. They did not reply.
Oﬃcials in Kasika have not released a death toll, and there is little or no prospect of an independent criminal investigation into what residents are calling a massacre.
But locals insist the M23 is the only armed group which can operate freely, and shoot to kill in broad daylight in Goma.
Since taking the city at the end of January, the rebels have been in complete control. During the 18 days we spent on the ground, their authority was absolute.
They have been accused in the past of carrying out atrocities in other areas.
The heavily armed rebels do not act alone. They are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, according to the UN and the US. Rwanda denies this, though it no longer denies having its own troops in DR Congo, saying they are there in self-defence.
It is believed the M23 targeted Kasika because of a former Congolese army base in the area.
The Katindo camp is now closed but some of the soldiers and their families remain in the district.
""Not all the soldiers were able to run away,"" a local resident explains. ""Some threw away their guns and stayed about the neighbourhood.""
But Freddy Mukuza was a civilian - a married father of two, struggling to get by. When hard times came, he earned a living by taking passengers on his motorbike.
He was also an activist and songwriter who rapped about the many problems in his homeland - a country rich in minerals whose people are amongst the poorest in the world.
DR Congo is known as a place of corruption and instability - and of conflict, stretching back 30 years. That is if the country and its suffering are remembered at all.
Sexual violence is endemic. The government is weak, at best.
There was plenty for Freddy to rap about.
One of his songs is called Au Secours (Help in French), the lyrics full of questions that have gone unanswered:
""Who will come to the aid of these people? Who will come to the aid of these raped women? Who will come to the aid of these unemployed men?... The people are in danger, they don't have enough to eat. They [the authorities] buy jeeps.""
On the day of his death, Freddy was moving to a new rented home in Kasika. His brother-in-law was helping him put a tarpaulin over the roof.
His sister-in-law was there too, getting the house ready for Freddy's family. When they heard the shooting, they were inside and rushed to shut the door, but they were seen by the M23.
The rebels shot and killed Freddy's two in-laws, according to his friend Justin.
Since then, Justin has barely left home, not even to earn money. His family is surviving on vegetables and fruit. Tea is now a luxury they cannot afford.
He has stopped his children going to school, for fear they might be taken from their classrooms by the M23 and forcibly recruited.
""We believe it is more important that they stay alive,"" he says.
His world has shrunk to his own four walls. There is the constant nagging fear that the rebels could return hunting for young men.
Just the sight of one of their pick-up trucks in the street sends locals running, he says.
These days it is rare to find a group of young people talking together, he tells us, and neighbours no long share gripes about the authorities as they did before the rebel takeover.
""Before, there was bad governance, but we were free,"" he says. ""There was embezzlement. There was mismanagement and we spoke out about that. We had the chance to go to court. Today, there is bad governance, but we live in terror and silence.""
Justin is speaking to us because he wants Freddy Mukuza to be remembered, and he wants the outside world to know about life and death under the M23.
Since the killings, Kasika has been shrouded in fear. Local journalists have not reported the story.
But a shaky video was posted on social media the next day, 23 February, which appears to show some of the victims: 10 bodies are visible - dumped in a tangled heap, in an unfinished building. It is unclear if any of the dead were soldiers.
None are in uniform and there is no sign of any weapons.
In the background there are screams and shouts. One woman repeats over and over: ""There are 10 of them,"" as she moves from body to body.
""They are going to finish us all,"" she says. ""They killed all these young people. Isn't that Junior? I think it is him. He is a house builder.""
Without the video, news of the killings might not have spread beyond the neighbourhood.
But the footage had the power to shock, even by the violent standards of DR Congo.
Our sources say it is authentic. One confirmed that the location shown is in Kasika.
He visited the place after the bodies were moved. And he recognised one of those seen crying in the video, from around the neighbourhood.
Two of our sources say the youngest to die in Kasika was a boy aged 13-14. The teenager was inside his own home, hiding behind his sisters.
""The M23 said: 'If this boy does not come with us, we will kill all of you,'"" one man told us.
The boy was then led away to his death.
There was also a young woman among the victims. She had been selling milk on the overcrowded streets.
Also killed - another street vendor, in his twenties.
When the shooting started, he was sitting in his usual spot - on the pavement outside his own front door, selling airtime for mobile phones and home-made doughnuts.
He was overheard pleading with the rebels: ""I'm not a soldier.
""I just sell airtime. Look, these are my things - my airtime and my basket of doughnuts.""
Then he ran. One of his friends takes up the story. We are calling him John.
""I was in the house, and I heard gunfire,"" John tells us. ""People were saying: 'They are taking young people by force.' I saw people running, including my friend, so I ran with them.
""When we reached the main road, there was shooting, and I heard gunfire behind me and somebody fell.""
That was the doughnut seller.
Despite his age, he was still in secondary school, in his final year. He was a keen student who had a late start because his family could not afford to educate him.
But John says: ""Like all young people, he had a dream."" In his case, it was to be an engineer.
John says the rebels did not care who they killed.
""There was no inquiry before shooting,"" he tells us. ""They just shot at everyone who was present, and at people who ran away, in two different directions.""
When the M23 captured Goma, they announced they had no prisons. John says no further explanation was needed: ""That meant whoever is presumed to be a government soldier, or a thief, or whoever makes a mistake, will be killed - immediately.""
Weeks on, few have dared to speak out. ""No-one wants to be next,"" John says.
Bereaved families have held small hasty burials - without the usual mourning at home.
""The rebels didn't want any funerals,"" says one resident, who we are calling Deborah. ""They didn't even want people to cry. We thought they were coming to bring peace, but instead they came to exterminate us. They took everyone they found on the street.""
As the men were being rounded up, she tried to step outside. The rebels ordered her back in, at gunpoint.
Denis Baeni was on his way home when the rebels arrived in Kasika. He dashed into a small shop to hide with a few others, our sources say.
The primary school teacher got his ID card out of a pocket. He may have thought that would save him, by proving he was a civilian.
A neighbour - with knowledge of the events - tells us what happened. We are calling her Rebecca.
""They heard a voice from outside asking: 'Are there any soldiers?'"" Rebecca says. ""They said no but the M23 took them out of the shop.""
The men were told to walk a short distance to a half-built house where they were ""assembled for execution"".
""There was so much gunfire,"" she says. ""It was so close. There were 21 people killed all at once from our neighbourhood. Many were just passing by.""
Rebecca insists they were all civilians. ""Not one was a soldier,"" she says.
Denis leaves behind two children, who he was raising alone.
Death is not the only danger here. Locals also face the risk of being recruited to fight - willingly or otherwise.
""Nowadays men have to be home by 17:30,"" says Rebecca. ""By 18:00 it's dark, and they can take you very easily.""
As families in Kasika are forced to stifle their grief, the M23 are continuing their sweep through eastern DR Congo.
After Goma, they took control of the city of Bukavu in mid-February. They have threatened to go all the way to the capital, Kinshasa, 1,600km (almost 1,000 miles) away.
They claim they are revolutionaries battling a failed state, and defending the rights of minority Tutsis.
Human rights groups paint a very different picture.
They have accused the armed group of a catalogue of abuses since its foundation in 2012 - including systematic shelling of civilian areas, gang rape and ""summary executions"". The allegations have been documented in a series of reports.
In a recent BBC interview, I asked rebel leader, Corneille Nangaa, for a response. He heads a coalition of political parties and militias - called the Congo River Alliance - which includes the M23.
""I didn't see the reports,"" he said. ""I cannot respond for the report that I didn't read"". He also said he was not worried by the allegations.
Pushed on why he had not read the reports, he said: ""Give me one, I will be reading it.""
Nangaa, a former head of DR Congo's electoral commission, alternates between combat fatigues and smart suits.
He is presented as the unarmed and unthreatening face of the rebels, but the Congolese government is offering a $5m (£4m) reward for information leading to his arrest.
The rebels are not alone in having a history of brutality. The same applies to the Congolese army, and to many of the other armed groups in eastern DR Congo.
But the M23 are now the only authority in parts of the east, and millions of Congolese are at their mercy.
As we spoke to one resident of Kasika, his wife called him, asking him to come quickly to take their eight-year-old son from school.
Panic was spreading because of reports the M23 were taking children from their classrooms.
He got his child home safely but fears for the future.
""We are all traumatised. They said they came to liberate us,"" he said. ""But now it's like they are taking us hostage. ""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05m013rppjo,Southern African forces to leave DR Congo as rebels gain ground,2025-03-13T17:58:42.152Z,"Danai Nesta Kupemba in London and Shingai Nyoka in Harare
BBC News","Southern African leaders have announced they will pull their troops out of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where they have been helping the government fight rebel forces.
The troops were sent two years ago to support the Congolese army fight the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels, which has seized control of large parts of mineral-rich eastern DR Congo this year.
At least 19 soldiers from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania were killed when the M23 captured the region's biggest city, Goma, in January.
Thousands of people have been killed during the fighting and hundreds of thousands left without shelter after fleeing their homes.
There have been concerns the fighting could escalate to a wider regional conflict.
The M23 has continued to gain ground in eastern DR Congo and last month seized the region's second-biggest city, Bukavu.
South Africa's deployment was heavily criticised by the public and opposition following the killing of its soldiers.
Announcing the withdrawal, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the ""situation is precarious, but the peace as it is now is holding"".
However, the M23 has continued to seize more territory this week.
Sandile Swanda, a South African political analyst, told the BBC it was an ""embarrassing"" situation for her country.
""The rebels are very strong. This is a full-on war and South Africa is hardly ready for any such war,"" he said.
He added: ""No country in the Sadc region is ready for this war - psychologically, militarily and politically.""
But the withdrawal is not just a setback for South Africa, it's a blow to both Sadc and the DR Congo, analysts say.
Stephanie Wolters, a senior research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs, told the BBC that Sadc's withdrawal weakens Kinshasa's position.
""They [Sadc] have gone from being on Kinshasa's side to being at best in a neutral position,"" she said.
In February, Malawi's president said its troops would be withdrawn from DR Congo, although he didn't give a reason.
The decision to start a ""phased withdrawal"" from DR Congo was made during a virtual summit of the 16-member Southern African Development Community (Sadc) in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, on Thursday.
No reason was given.
The Sadc leaders said that even though the troops would be withdrawn from DR Congo, the bloc would continue to ""support interventions aimed at bringing lasting peace"".
Sadc also called for a diplomatic and political solution to the conflict.
Previous efforts to bring peace to DR Congo have not been successful.
But Angola has announced this week that it will host peace talks between DR Congo and the M23 next week in the capital, Luanda. The M23 said they ""welcomed"" this move.
DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi has previously refused to engage in direct negotiations with the group, insisting on only talking to Rwanda.
This was Sadc's third emergency summit on DR Congo in recent months.
It is unclear how many Sadc troops are in DR Congo, but 5,000 troops were due to be sent.
South Africa, which leads the mission, was to deploy 2,900 troops and the rest shared between Malawi and Tanzania.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd92z3823qyo,South Africa in 'uncharted waters' as budget splits coalition government,2025-03-13T08:34:22.381Z,"Khanyisile Ngcobo
BBC News, Johannesburg","South Africa has entered uncharted waters following deep divisions in the coalition government over the national budget that has finally been tabled after a month-long delay.
This is the view of analysts after Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana's budget drew a backlash from various quarters, including key partners in the coalition government rejecting his proposals for a second time.
The African National Congress (ANC) formed a government of national unity (GNU) with nine other parties after losing its parliamentary majority in elections last year.
And, without the support of its biggest coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance (DA), it will fail to pass the budget unless it rethinks its contentious policies or gets the backing of the biggest opposition parties.
Godongwana was forced to postpone his budget presentation last month after fierce resistance to his plan to raise value-added-tax (VAT), which would have seen the prices of goods go up at a time when South Africans are hard-hit by the cost-of-living crisis.
This delay sent shockwaves through South Africa at the time, as it was the first time this had happened since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.
Following a series of meetings between the parties in government, Godongwana returned on Wednesday to present what he called a ""bold and pragmatic"" budget.
In his revised budget, the minister tried to appease his GNU partners by announcing a reduced VAT increase, to be implemented over a two-year period.
Godongwana had initially proposed increasing VAT from15% to 17%, but has now suggested raising it to 16% in two stages.
The minister says that increasing taxes is necessary to tackle ""persistent spending pressures in health, education, transport and security"".
""They [other parties] have to make a choice - do we close schools, hospitals or clinics? They have to make that choice. Do we fire people? That is the choice we have to make and that is not a good choice to make,"" Godongwana said.
The minister added that he had opted to target VAT rather than personal and corporate taxes, as the latter two would generate less revenue while ""potentially harming investment, job creation and economic growth"".
Godongwana's revised budget has the support of his party, the ANC, but has failed to appease the DA, which said it would not ""support any increase in taxes, unless those increases were temporary and the ANC agreed to a series of major reforms"" that would grow the economy, reduce waste and create jobs within the next three years.
The impasse has tarnished President Cyril Ramaphosa's much-vaunted reputation as a deal-maker, with only one of his coalition partners - the small Patriotic Alliance (PA) - supporting the budget.
The latest tussle highlights deepening divisions in the fragile coalition government, as the two biggest parties have locked horns over key issues since its formation.
This includes a controversial land law, which allows for private property to be seized by the government in certain cases, without any compensation offered to owners.
The DA is challenging the law in court, arguing that it is unconstitutional and threatens property rights in South Africa.
The two biggest opposition parties - former President Jacob Zuma's Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - have also rejected the budget, saying the proposed tax hikes would hit the poor the hardest.
This leaves the ANC in a difficult situation, at it needs the support of at least one of the three other biggest parties to pass the budget.
An analyst at South Africa's Wits University, Thokozile Madonko, says the deadlock over the budget has left South Africa in ""uncharted waters"".
She tells the BBC that the role of parliament will now be ""absolutely critical"" as it either accepted, changed or rejected the budget.
And while in the past the ANC could always push through its policies, this is no longer the case.
This will force it to strike a deal with other parties or risk seeing the budget being voted down - something that could result in the collapse of the coalition government.
Ms Madonko criticised Godongwana's decision to take the ""laziest option"" by proposing an increase in VAT, which will affect the entire population, rather than targeting the richest section of the population by introducing a ""wealth tax"" on them.
Another expert, Adrian Saville, said the budget was a ""folly"" as the minister repeated many old promises to promote economic growth and create jobs in a country where unemployment is standing at more than 30%.
""Those are words. Give us the numbers [and] tell us what you intend to do so that when we meet again in a year's time, we know whether you've been successful or if you've fallen short,"" he tells the BBC.
Godongwana has long been seen as a steady pair of hands, commanding the respect of both the business sector and the trade union movement.
But his credibility has taken a knock following the crisis over the budget. He now faces the challenge of salvaging his reputation by steering the budget through parliament - or people would increasingly question his suitability for the post.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdel6e9570jo,A man called Bombshell fires up Zimbabwe's succession battle,2025-03-13T01:16:05.620Z,"Shingai Nyoka
BBC News, Harare","A long convoy of armoured personnel tanks rolling through a Harare neighbourhood sparked concerns - for a brief moment - that a military coup was afoot in Zimbabwe.
""What's going on in Zimbabwe?"" one person posted on social media. Another said: ""The last time this happened there was a coup.""
Government spokesman Nick Mangwana was quick to allay the public's fears, explaining the tanks were in the capital that mid-February morning as part of a scheduled exercise to test equipment and were ""nothing to be concerned about"".
Yet the chatter and speculation continued, revealing much about the state of the country.
Ahead of the routine military drill, President Emmerson Mnangagwa had, for the first time since becoming president in 2017, faced harsh criticism about his leadership from within his Zanu-PF party with calls for him to step down.
The accusations evoked memories of the lead-up to the coup that toppled his predecessor, long-time leader Robert Mugabe.
He had come to power in 1980 as the revolutionary hero who ended decades of white-minority rule. But his demise was heralded when veterans of the 1970s war of independence withdrew their support for him.
It was a war veteran and senior Zanu-PF member named Blessed Geza, also known as ""Bombshell"", who launched a verbal offensive against Mnangagwa.
He became angered when some within the party began pushing to change the country's laws to allow for the president to seek a third term.
In a series of often expletive-laden press conferences, gritty-voiced and with a furrowed forehead, he repeatedly called on the 82-year-old president to go or face being removed.
""I must apologise for helping him come into office,"" said Geza in one press conference aired on social media about the president, who goes by the nickname ""The Crocodile"".
""As soon as he [Mnangagwa] had the taste of power, he escalated corruption, forgot the people and only remembered his family,"" said the outspoken war veteran, who was then a member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee.
""Mnangagwa has also surrendered state power to his wife and children. We sadly see history repeating itself. We can't allow that to happen.""
Zanu-PF was outraged by his ""disloyal"" remarks - later described as ""amounting to treason"" - forcing Bombshell into hiding from where, through his representatives, he continues to make taunts via social media, hinting at protests.
He is wanted by the police on four charges, including vehicle theft, undermining the authority of the president and inciting public violence.
Blessed Mhlanga, the journalist who first interviewed Bombshell back in November, has also been arrested on charges of transmitting a message that incites violence.
Trouble began brewing over Mnangagwa's ambitions to stay in office during Zanu-PF rallies last year. The president is currently serving his second and final term, which expires in 2028.
The slogan ""2030 he will still be the leader"" began to be uttered by his supporters despite Zimbabwe's constitution limiting presidential terms to two five-year terms.
They argued that he would need to remain in office to complete his ""Agenda 2030"" development programme as he was doing such great work.
A motion was then adopted unanimously at Zanu-PF's conference in December that did not explicitly speak of a third term but sought to extend Mnangagwa's existing term until 2030.
Despite a recent assurance from Mnangagwa that he did intend to step down in three years, the influential Roman Catholic bishops have become involved.
In a pastoral letter last week, Zimbabwe's Catholic Bishops Conference warned that the 2030 debate was a distraction from the things that truly mattered - business closures, high unemployment, rampant corruption and economic policies that favour the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans.
Presidential spokesman George Charamba expressed his disappointment about the clerics' pronouncement, telling the state-run Herald newspaper the matter was now ""dead and buried"".
Nonetheless, Bombshell's message seems to have landed. It has resulted in a purge in Zanu-PF, with the expulsion of Geza and some of his allies.
Yet political analyst Takura Zhangazha says Geza's outburst is unlikely to galvanise crowds to his cause.
These days people are less interested in such political spectacles, he says, unlike at the time of Mugabe's downfall when Zimbabweans, including opposition party supporters, turned out en masse to support the coup - thanking the military and the war veterans.
""Even that attempt by Geza to talk about corruption and the plight of the workers - it's not going to get people riled up, organising, mobilising. They don't have that capacity or interest any more,"" he tells the BBC.
""I can promise you there's no repeat of 2017 before 2028,"" he said, adding that Zimbabweans feel they were used in the ousting of Mugabe and would not be brought out on the streets again for Zanu-PF's internal battles.
This is also because there are splits across the political landscape, including a weak opposition.
Even the war veterans do not represent a united front, Mr Zhangazha says.
Geza has previously voiced support in the succession debate for Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga, the 68-year-old former army chief, but other war veterans are known to back the 2030 agenda.
Political analyst Alexander Rusero says it is important to understand the war veterans' influential role in both Zimbabwe and Zanu-PF.
""They see themselves as caretakers, so you can't wish away their sentiments,"" he tells the BBC.
However, he believes that the current grievances aired by the likes of Bombshell are prompted more by self-regard than public interest.
""They feel as if they are excluded from the cake that they should otherwise be enjoying,"" he tells the BBC.
Mr Zhangazha agrees that those who show loyalty within the governing party are likely to benefit from things like tenders, government contracts, access to housing, land and agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and seeds.
For Jameson Timba, the leader of a faction of the main opposition party, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), it all sums up the state of politics in Zimbabwe.
""You have a country where the economic situation is deteriorating. People can hardly afford more than one meal a day,"" he told the BBC.
""We have major supermarket chains which are literally closing down,"" he said, referencing the economic woes facing OK Zimbabwe, one of the country's biggest retailers that has been forced to close several big branches with empty shelves in others.
Mr Zhangazha noted the forecast for the fragile economy looks even more grim thanks to the fallout from the recent suspension of USAID.
Timba is still recovering from a five-month stint in jail, spending most of his incarceration sitting on a concrete floor, sharing a cell and toilet with 80 people.
He was arrested in June, along with more than 70 others, for hosting an ""unlawful meeting"" at his private residence when he held a barbeque to mark the International Day of the African Child.
His treatment - and those of his fellow detainees - reflected how opposition politics was being criminalised, he told the BBC.
""The country is facing challenges. Any leader or government worth his salt would actually call for an early election, to check and determine whether they still have the mandate of the people,"" he said.
""To do the opposite represents a joke essentially [when] you're talking about extending a term of office.""
However, there is little chance of an early vote.
For now, Bombshell remains in hiding and the elections are years away - but the succession debate will keep cooking.

BBC News","Somali security forces have ended a deadly 24-hour siege by Islamist fighters who stormed a popular hotel in the central city of Beledweyne, authorities said.
The attack by al-Shabab began with a car bomb exploding, followed by gunmen entering the hotel, leading to intense clashes with security forces.
""The attackers have been neutralised. Some detonated themselves while others were killed by police forces,"" Omar Osman Calasow, the mayor of Beledweyne district, told the BBC.
The mayor said seven people had been killed in the attack but witnesses said the death toll could be higher.
The raid at the Qahira Hotel took place as politicians, security officials and traditional elders were meeting to discuss plans for an offensive against al-Shabab in central Somalia.
Police officer Ali Mahad told AFP news agency that most of those in attendance had been rescued.
A federal lawmaker from Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jesow, told the BBC that about seven gunmen had attacked the hotel.
It is unclear how many people have been wounded, but the lawmaker said they were trying to organise planes to fly victims to Mogadishu for treatment.
Parts of the hotel were reduced to rubble as government forces and gunmen exchanged fire, shopkeeper Ali Suleiman, who witnessed the attack, told the Reuters news agency.
""We first heard a huge blast followed by gunfire, then another blast was heard,"" he said.
Calasow said the 24-hour siege ended on Wednesday morning, leaving ""significant damage"".
""Among those killed in the attack were military officers, traditional elders, and soldiers,"" Calasow added.
Al-Shabab said it had killed 20 people, including government officials and leaders of a pro-government clan militia.
The federal government said it was still investigating and has not commented on the reported killing of the officials.
In a statement, Ali Abdullahi Hussein, the president of Hirshabelle state, praised the security forces for their bravery in neutralising the extremist militants.
""Let us unite to complete the elimination of these brutal extremists,"" Hussein added.
Beledweyne is about 335km (208 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, and is a strategic location in the campaign against al-Shabab.
The Somali forces, alongside African Union peacekeepers, continue to wage a campaign against the militants, which remain a big threat despite the ongoing military operations.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4vp9wg99yo,Thousands celebrate a chief who will only rule for eight years,2025-03-12T00:21:13.298Z,"Amensisa Ifa
BBC News, Arda Jila Badhasa","Thousands of people have been gathering in southern Ethiopia for one of the country's biggest cultural events.
The week-long Gada ceremony, which ended on Sunday, sees the official transfer of power from one customary ruler to his successor - something that happens every eight years.
The tradition of regularly appointing a new Abbaa Gadaa has been practised by the Borana community for centuries - and sees them gather at the rural site of Arda Jila Badhasa, near the Ethiopian town of Arero.
It is a time to celebrate their special form of democracy as well as their cultural heritage, with each age-group taking the opportunity to wear their different traditional outfits.
These are paraded the day before the official handover during a procession when married women march with wooden batons, called ""siinqee"".
The batons have symbolic values of protection for women, who use them during conflict.
If a siinqee stick is placed on the ground by a married woman between two quarrelling parties, it means the conflict must stop immediately out of respect.
During the procession, younger women walk at the front, distinguished from the married women by the different colour of their clothing.
In this pastoralist society, women are excluded from holding the top position of Abbaa Gadaa, sitting on the council of elders or being initiated into the system as a child.
But their important role can be seen during the festival as they build all the accommodation for those staying for the week - and prepare all the food.
And the unique Gada system of governance, which was added to the UN's cultural heritage list in 2016, allows for them to attend regular community meetings and to voice their opinions to the Abbaa Gadaa.
Gada membership is only open to boys whose fathers are already members - young initiates have their heads shaven at the crown to make their rank clear.
The smaller the circle, the older he is.
As the global cultural body Unesco reports, oral historians teach young initiates about ""history, laws, rituals, time reckoning, cosmology, myths, rules of conduct, and the function of the Gada system"".
Training for boys begins as young as eight years old.
Later, they will be assessed for their potential as future leaders.
As they grow up, tests include walking long distances barefoot, slaughtering cattle efficiently and showing kindness to fellow initiates.
Headpieces made from cowrie shells are traditionally worn by young trainees. The only other people allowed to wear them are elderly women.
Both groups are revered by Borana community members.
Men aged between 28 and 32 are identified by the ostrich feathers they wear, which are known in the Afaan Oromo language as ""baalli"".
Their attendance at the Gada ceremony is an opportunity to learn, prepare and bond as it is already known who from this age-group will be named Abbaa Gadaa in 2033.
The main event at the recent Gada ceremony was the handover of power, from the outgoing 48-year-old Abbaa Gadaa to his younger successor.
Well-wishers crossed the border from Kenya and others travelled from as far as Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to witness the spectacle. The governor of Kenya's Marsabit county was among the honoured guests.
Thirty-seven-year-old Guyo Boru Guyo, seen here in white, holding a spear, was chosen to lead because he impressed the council of elders during his teenage years.
He becomes the 72nd Abbaa Gadaa and will now oversee the Borana people who live in both southern Ethiopia and north-western Kenya.
As their top diplomat, he will also be responsible for solving the feuds that may emerge in the pastoralist community.
These often involve cattle-raiding and disputes over access to water in this drought-prone region.
During his eight years at the helm, his successor will finish his training to take on the job in continuation of this generations-old tradition.

BBC News","South Sudan's government has denied earlier reports that Uganda had deployed special forces to its capital, Juba.
Uganda's military chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba said the soldiers had gone to the neighbouring country to help South Sudanese President Salva Kiir ""secure"" the city.
The statement came amid escalating tensions between Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, raising fears that their fragile peace deal could collapse and a conflict could resume.
""We shall protect the entire territory of South Sudan like it was our own,"" Gen Kainerugaba had written on the social media platform X.
Uganda's army spokesperson Felix Kulayigye also confirmed the deployment to the BBC but declined to reveal details.
South Sudan's government did not immediately respond to the reports on Tuesday morning, but speaking to local media later Information Minister Michael Makuei said Ugandan troops were not in Juba.
Concern about the security situation in South Sudan has been mounting, with the US on Saturday ordering the evacuation of all its non-emergency staff from the country.
Last week, the deputy chief of the army and two ministers - all allies of Machar - were arrested by the security forces, which an opposition spokesman called a ""grave violation"" of the peace deal.
One of the ministers has since been released.
The arrests followed clashes in the Upper Nile state between government forces and a militia known as the White Army.
It had fought alongside Machar during the civil war that broke out in 2013 following a power struggle between him and Kiir.
It led to heavy fighting in Juba, with Kiir accusing Machar of plotting a coup.
Machar denied the allegation, but South Sudan then plunged into a civil war that killed more than 400,000 people.
A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented - including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army.

BBC News","Athol Fugard, who has died aged 92, was widely acclaimed as one of South Africa's greatest playwrights.
The son of an Afrikaner mother, he was best known for his politically charged plays challenging the racist system of apartheid.
Paying tribute to Fugard, South Africa's Arts and Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie hailed him as ""a fearless storyteller who laid bare the harsh realities of apartheid through his plays"".
""We were cursed with apartheid, but blessed with great artists who shone a light on its impact and helped to guide us out of it. We owe a huge debt to this late, wonderful man,"" McKenzie added.
Fugard wrote more than 30 plays in a career that spanned 70 years, making his mark with The Blood Knot in 1961.
It was the first play in South Africa with a black and white actor - Fugard himself - performing in a front of a multiracial audience, before the apartheid regime introduced laws prohibiting mixed casts and audiences.
The Blood Knot catapulted Fugard onto the international stage - with the play shown in the US, and adapted for British television.
The apartheid regime later confiscated his passport, but it strengthened Fugard's resolve to keep breaking racial barriers and exposing the injustices of apartheid.
He went on to work with the Serpent Players, a group of black actors, and performed in black townships, despite harassment from the apartheid regime's security forces.
Fugard's celebrated plays included Boesman and Lena, which looked at the difficult circumstances of a mixed-race couple. Having premiered in 1969, it was made into a film in 2000 starring Danny Glover and Angela Bassett.
His novel, Tsotsi, was also made into a film, winning the 2006 Oscar for best foreign language movie.
The premier of South Africa's Western Cape province, Alan Winde, said that Fugard had a ""penetrating, sharp wit"", and his ""acute understanding of our country's political and cultural make-up is unmatched"".
""He will be sorely missed,"" Winde added.
Other well-known plays by Fugard include Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island, which he co-wrote with the actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona, in a powerful condemnation of life on Robben Island, where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was imprisoned.
In a simple tribute on X, Kani posted: ""I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend Athol Fugard. May his soul rest in eternal peace. Elder 🌹""
Fugard won several awards for his work, and received a lifetime achievement honour at the prestigious Tony awards in 2011, while Time magazine described him in 1985 as the greatest active playwright in the English-speaking world.
""Apartheid defined me, that is true... But I am proud of the work that came out of it, that carries my name,"" Fugard told the AFP news agency in 1995.
Fugard feared that the end of apartheid in 1994 could leave him with little to do, but he still found enough material to write.
In a BBC interview in 2010, he said that he shared the view of the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu that ""we have lost our way"" as a nation.
""I think the present society in South Africa needs the vigilance of writers, every bit as much as the old one did.
""It is a responsibility that young writers, playwrights, must really wake up to and understand that responsibility is theirs, just as it was mine and a host of other writers in the earlier years.""

BBC News","Police in Kenya have fired tear gas to disperse protesters who tried to occupy a church that was recently given a substantial donation by President William Ruto.
The gift to the Jesus Winner Ministry in the Roysambu suburb of Nairobi of 20m shillings ($155,000; £120,000) drew criticism from some young Kenyans struggling with the high cost of living.
Ruto has defended his donation and has offered a similar gift to another church in Eldoret.
Last year, both Kenya's Catholic and Anglican leaders rejected donations, arguing that there was a need to protect the church from being used for political purposes.
At least 38 people were arrested during the clashes before being released without charge.
The clashes saw protesters try to get into the church and light fires and use rocks to block nearby roads.
But the church service went ahead with tight security for worshippers, local media reported.
Bishop Edward Mwai said that unnamed people had mobilised ""thugs"" to disrupt the church service, reports the Star website.
Ruto, an evangelical Christian, defended the donation, saying it was an attempt to address the country's moral decay.
""Kenya must know God so that we shame the people who are telling us that we cannot associate with the church,"" the Nation site quoted him as saying at another church, in Eldoret.
Kenyans have been angered by a series of tax rises introduced since Ruto was elected in 2022.
He says they were needed to pay off the huge debts he inherited from the previous government but many Kenyans argue that he should first tackle public waste and corruption.
Last year, a wave of nationwide protests forced Ruto to withdraw his Finance Bill, which contained a series of tax rises.

BBC News","The United States has ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave, amid rising tensions in the country.
Fighting in recent days has threatened an already fragile peace deal between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.
The two leaders signed a peace agreement in 2018 to end a five-year civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, but their relationship has remained fraught.
On Sunday, the US State Department said that fighting was ongoing in South Sudan between various political and ethnic groups and that ""weapons are readily available to the population"".
""Due to the risks in the country, on March 08, 2025, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government employees,"" it said.
The UN human rights commission for South Sudan on Saturday warned of an ""alarming regression"" that threatened to undo years of progress towards peace.
President Kiir has called for calm and made an assurance that the country would not return to war.
In an escalation of the tensions, a UN helicopter that had been evacuating members of the national army was shot at on Friday, killing several people, including one crew member.
Earlier in the week, the deputy chief of the army and two ministers allied to Machar were arrested by security forces, which an opposition spokesman termed a ""grave violation"" of the peace deal.
The arrests of the Machar-allied officials followed clashes in the country's Upper Nile state between government forces and a militia known as the White Army, which had fought alongside Machar during the civil war.
South Sudan, the world's newest nation, gained independence in 2011 after seceding from Sudan.
But just two years later, following a rift between Kiir and Machar, the country descended into a civil war, in which more than 400,000 people were killed.
The 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented – including a new constitution, an election, and the reunification of armed groups into a single army.
Sporadic violence between ethnic or local groups has continued in parts of the country.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzkv7yl43o,DR Congo offers $5m bounties for rebel leaders,2025-03-09T10:46:41.637Z,"Joseph Winter & Will Ross
BBC News","The Democratic Republic of Congo government has offered a reward of $5m (£4m) for help arresting three leaders of a rebel group which has seized much of the east of the country this year.
Corneille Nangaa, a former head of DR Congo's electoral commission, now leads the Congo River Alliance, which includes the M23 rebel group. He has addressed large rallies in the cities under the group's control.
The bounty is also on offer for M23 leaders Sultani Makenga and Bertrand Bisimwa.
Last year the three men were prosecuted in absentia by a military court and given death sentences for treason.
A reward of $4m (£3) was also offered for the arrest of two journalists living in exile, and others the government describes as accomplices.
But the chances of anyone being arrested appear slim.
In recent weeks the army has been no match for the Rwandan-backed rebels who have captured large parts of the mineral-rich eastern DR Congo, including the region's two largest cities - Goma and Bukavu.
So President Félix Tshisekedi has instead focused on trying to build international pressure for Rwanda to face sanctions for backing the rebels.
Last year, a report by UN experts said up to 4,000 Rwanda troops were working with the M23 in DR Congo.
Thousands of people have been killed during the fighting and hundreds of thousands left without shelter after fleeing their homes.
The Congolese government is also seeking US support in exchange for access to its minerals.
DR Congo accuses Rwanda of trying to take control of its minerals, which include gold and coltan, used in consumers electronics such as mobile phones and computers.
In response to the reports that DR Congo was offering access to the minerals in exchange for military help fighting the M23 rebels, presidential spokeswoman Tina Salama said on X last month that President Tshisekedi was inviting the US ""whose companies source strategic raw materials from Rwanda, materials that are looted from the DRC and smuggled to Rwanda"" to instead buy them from the Congolese - the ""rightful owners"".
Rwanda denies looting minerals from DR Congo.
It no longer denies backing the M23 but says it is trying to prevent the conflict in DR Congo from spilling over into its own territory.
Rwanda also accuses the Congolese government of working with a different armed group in DR Congo, which is linked to those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis were massacred.
Both the M23 and Rwanda's government are led by Tutsis.
The Congolese government denies working with the FDLR group accused by Rwanda of being a ""genocidal militia"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgepq6269vo,'My best friend went to work - and was crushed to death by rubbish',2025-03-09T03:59:21.753Z,"Hasham Cheema
BBC News, Kampala","Fighting back the tears, 22-year-old rubbish collector Okuku Prince recalls the moment his best friend's lifeless body was found at a massive rubbish dump in Uganda's capital, Kampala.
The landslide at the Kiteezi dump last August killed 30 people, including his friend Sanya Kezia.
""I think some people are still underneath the garbage,"" he tells the BBC.
Many of them eked out a living by washing and selling whatever discarded items they found that still had value - anything from fishing nets to plastic bottles, glass jars and the components of old electronic devices.
A blame-game erupted after the fatal collapse, with Kampala's city council and central government accusing each other of negligence, while some of the dead still languished under tonnes of rubbish without the dignity of a burial.
When government tractors did eventually dig up Kezia's body, there were injuries to the 21-year-old's face.
It was horrifying for his friend to see him enveloped by stinking, rotting waste.
""We're not safe here. Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,"" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.
Unable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.
Youth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.
""I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,"" says Mr Prince. ""I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or £2.10] a day.""
The collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.
The houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.
Compensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.
Officials are ""waiting for the valuation and budget allocation"", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).
Some argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.
""You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,"" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.
The Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.
As Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.
On the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still.
Birds of prey can be seen flying overhead.
The city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.
But the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.
""With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,"" Mr Muramuzi explains.
""Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.""
Yet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.
Had that already been in place, ""the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided"", he says.
So, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?
The answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.
Ultimate responsibility for keeping Kampala ""clean, habitable, and sustainable environment"" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.
The KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.
""All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid… but their capacity is very limited,"" the Kampala mayor said recently.
""If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.""
There is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.
It did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were ""found to be responsible"".
A month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.
James Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.
At present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce ""unnecessary waste"" coming into the city.
But they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.
""We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,"" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.
""If you sort, waste has different destinations. If you mix, it all goes to one - the landfill.""
Experts say such initiatives are important but do not address the bigger structural inadequacies at Kiteezi.
And for people whose lives have been shattered by recent events there, it is too little too late.
""They promised us compensation, but I haven't received anything - almost everyone is complaining too,"" Mr Prince tells the BBC.
""We lost our friend. All that transpired in the process was sorrow.""

BBC News","People affected by leprosy in Nigeria should be able to get hold of vital drugs to treat the disease for the first time in a year from this weekend, the World Health Organization has said.
The country, which reports more than 2,000 new cases a year ran out of supplies partly because drugs were held up after new regulations were introduced.
The WHO said it had asked Nigeria to briefly lift its new testing policy and it expects the drugs to arrive from India on Sunday.
Leprosy is curable with a combination of different antibiotics, but if left untreated the patients' health can deteriorate with sores and nerve damage that cause deformities.
The treatment can last between six and 12 months.
But because of the lack of drugs in Nigeria, patients have been sent home from hospitals. As the drugs suppress transmission this increases the risk of the disease spreading.
Dr Samimu Msheliza, a public health expert and medical advisor at the Nigerian branch of the Leprosy Mission, highlighted the urgent need for medication.
""We have thousands of newly diagnosed leprosy patients across various cities who are just waiting for this drug,"" he told the BBC.
""The quicker we have [the drugs], the better, because currently these people are suffering, their transmission is ongoing because they are not being treated,"" Dr Msheliza said.
The Reuters news agency spoke to one woman at a hospital in Nasarawa state, who said her condition had got much worse since she was not able to get hold of the combination of drugs.
All Awwal Musa's fingers were clawed and her legs discharged pus. ""Before last year, my wounds were getting healed but now they are getting worse. The pain is worse,"" Ms Musa is quoted as saying.
The nerve damage may be irreversible.
Nigeria's drug authority introduced new regulations for medicines aimed at tackling the importation of counterfeit and sub-standard drugs.
In recent years, several medicines have been recalled for failing to meet safety standards.
But the new measures have had an impact on the availability of crucial treatments, including those for leprosy.

BBC News","Several people have died in South Sudan after an attempt by the UN to evacuate members of the national army came under fire, the UN has said.
One crew member died when a UN helicopter was shot at, a statement from its mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, said. It added that an injured South Sudanese general and several other troops were also killed during the evacuation attempt in Upper Nile state.
The UN said the attack on its helicopter ""may constitute a war crime"".
South Sudan President Salva Kiir later said a second helicopter managed to take off after the attack, only to crash land, killing all on board. But Unmiss has said that both its aircraft landed safely in Malakal.
Twenty-seven South Sudanese soldiers were killed in total, Information Minister Michael Makuei is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying.
Weeks of fighting in Upper Nile has threatened an already fragile peace deal between President Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.
In 2013, a rift between the pair sparked a five-year civil war, during which 400,000 people were killed and 2.5 million forced from their homes.
A peace agreement was signed in 2018 but the situation has been fraught ever since.
The ongoing fighting in Upper Nile is between the armed forces and the White Army, an ethnic militia that was allied with Machar during the war.
In agreement with the White Army and South Sudan's army, Unmiss has been evacuating wounded troops from the conflict zone.
Unmiss head Nicholas Haysom said in a statement that the attack on his mission's personnel was ""utterly abhorrent and may constitute a war crime under international law. We deeply regret the tragic loss of our colleague and express our sincere condolences to his loved ones.
""We also regret the killing of those that we were attempting to extract, particularly when assurances of safe passage had been received.""
President Kiir said the army general who died in the attack was Gen Majur Dak, who led the forces stationed in Nasir, a region in Upper Nile.
Alongside the fighting, a slew of arrests has sparked concerns that South Sudan may see a return to war.
A number of Machar's allies, including the oil minister and a high-ranking army general, were detained earlier this week.
After Friday's attack, Kirr urged the nation to ""remain calm"".
""I have said time and again, that our country would not go back to war. Let no-one take the law into their own hands. The government, which I lead, will handle this crisis,"" he said.
South Sudan is the world's newest nation, after seceding from Sudan in 2011.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9w51pjzpo,South Africa rejects 'megaphone diplomacy' with US,2025-03-07T16:50:04.428Z,"Mayeni Jones
BBC News Africa correspondent, Johannesburg","The South African government has said it will not take part in ""counterproductive megaphone diplomacy"" following a fresh social media post by US President Donald Trump repeating his claim that Pretoria was confiscating land.
Trump extended his invitation to relocate those seeking ""to flee [South Africa] for reasons of safety"" to all farmers and offered them citizenship.
South Africa has previously said that Trump has misunderstood the country's new land expropriation act.
But it has already led to the US president freezing financial aid to the country.
Responding to the latest statement, the government said that South Africa was still committed to building a mutually beneficial trade, political and diplomatic relationship with the Trump administration.
A spokesperson added that the relationship between both countries should be based on mutual respect.
South Africa's new land law was signed in January, and allows land seizures without compensation in certain circumstances.
In his executive order last month that stopped aid to South Africa, Trump alleged there was discrimination against the white Afrikaner minority, descendants of Dutch and French settlers.
The US president said their land was being seized without compensation, something the South African government denies. He also offered refugee status to Afrikaner farmers, despite vowing to crack down on immigration.
On Friday, Trump said any farmer, not just Afrikaner ones, could relocate to the US.
The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.
Land ownership has been a contentious issue in South Africa with most private farmland owned by white people, 30 years after the end of the racist system of apartheid.
There have been continuous calls for the government to address land reform and deal with the past injustices of racial segregation.
The new law allows for expropriation without compensation only in circumstances where it is ""just and equitable and in the public interest"" to do so.
American funding to HIV programmes in South Africa was terminated last week.
The US government has also pulled out of a climate agreement that aimed to get richer countries to help a small group of developing ones, including South Africa, transition away from coal to green energy sources.

BBC News","Fifa's decision to ban for life a former Gabonese youth coach found guilty of sexually abusing players is a ""positive first step"", but there are ""many more perpetrators"", an official at global players' union Fifpro told the BBC.
On Tuesday Fifa ruled that Patrick Assoumou Eyi, who was head coach of Gabon's national youth teams for decades, had sexually abused multiple young boys throughout his career.
Eyi was named in a 2023 BBC Africa Eye investigation into the widespread allegations of abuse plaguing Gabonese football.
In the investigation, a former Gabonese international said Eyi held the ""position of a god"" as he had the power to decide who would play for Gabon's youth teams.
Eyi - known widely as Capello - is ""just one man that has been sanctioned"" and there are ""many more perpetrators"" within Gabonese football, Fifpro legal counsel Loic Alves told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.
""It is a positive first step, but it is just the first step,"" Mr Alves said.
Eyi had admitted charges of raping, grooming and exploiting young players after allegations were first reported by the UK's Guardian newspaper in 2021.
Fifa's independent ethics committee launched its investigation into Eyi later that year.
As well as being banned for life, Eyi has been fined one million Swiss francs (£880,000; $1.1m). He is currently being held in prison.
""The investigation into Mr Eyi concerns complaints from at least four male football players who accused him of sexual abuse between 2006 and 2021. Most of these incidents occurred while the players were minors,"" Fifa's statement said.
One of Eyi's alleged victims, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC on Wednesday he was pleased about the ban.
""But on the other hand, I'm not satisfied because I don't want us to stop there. It's a whole network, a system that needs to be dismantled, with many predators running free,"" they said.
In 2023, BBC Africa spoke to more that 30 witnesses who told of a sexual abuse network that had afflicted all levels of Gabonese football for three decades.
One victim said he was abused as a teenager at an under-17 football camp. Another, who played for Gabon's national team for several years, said he was assaulted from the age of 14.
Along with the perpetrators of the abuse, governing bodies such as Fifa and Gabon's national football federation, Fegafoot, have faced accusations that they failed to protect young victims.
Both bodies denied the allegations made against them.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74310qw53no,Nigerian senator suspended after making sexual harassment claims,2025-03-06T16:58:30.603Z,"Mansur Abubakar
BBC News, Abuja","Nigerian lawmakers have suspended a senator for six months, after she submitted a petition alleging she had been sexually harassed by the senate president.
Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan first made the accusations against one of the country's top politicians, Godswill Akpabio in an interview last Friday.
After dismissing her petition on procedural grounds, the ethics committee recommended Uduaghan's suspension, saying she had brought ""public opprobrium"" to the upper chamber of the National Assembly.
Some senators argued that her suspension be cut to three months but a majority voted to stick with the six months suspension recommended by the ethics committee.
Women's rights activist Hadiza Ado told the BBC that Senator Uduaghan's suspension was a “sad day for Nigerian women"".
Uduaghan afterwards described her suspension as ""an injustice that will not be sustained"".
She vowed to continue her ""pursuit for justice"" over her treatment.
The Senate leadership later stressed that Uduaghan had been suspended because she had engaged in ""unruly and disruptive"" behaviour during the session, and not because of her allegations against Akpabio.
The accusations have dominated discussions across Nigeria since she first made them nearly a week ago.
Many highly placed people and groups have called for a transparent investigation.
On Wednesday, two groups of protesters gathered at the assembly ground in the capital, Abuja - one backing Akpabio and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go.''
Mrs Ado, who founded the Women and Children Initiative, said: “We’ve been following events at the Assembly keenly and hoping that investigation into Natasha’s allegations would follow.”
“All we can say is that today is a sad day for Nigerian women fighting for emancipation. Out of 109 senators, only four are women and one is now suspended,” she said.
Many women on social media also expressed their anger over the suspension, with some calling it “oppression.”
During her suspension, Uduaghan will be barred from the National Assembly premises and her office will be locked.
Update 10 March: This story has been updated to reflect the reasons later given by the senate for suspending Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan

Maputo and Nairobi","At least a dozen people were injured after Mozambican police violently dispersed a protest led by opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane, the runner-up in last year's disputed presidential election, Mondlane's team and a civil society group say.
Eyewitnesses and Mondlane's aides said the police fired live rounds at the opposition leader's convoy and the anti-government protesters who had joined him on the streets of the capital, Maputo, on Wednesday.
Neither the police nor the authorities have commented.
The protests came as President Daniel Chapo, who took office in January, was due to sign a deal after talks with other political parties to end months of protests over the disputed election.
Mondlane, who has been calling for the protests, was excluded from the talks leading to the ceremony.
A communique from Mondlane's office said the opposition leader had been leading a procession on Wednesday afternoon when his convoy came under fire.
""A contingent of the UIR [a rapid intervention police unit] rammed into Venâncio Mondlane's convoy and began a barrage of gunfire, using live ammunition and tear gas,"" it added.
In response to the incident, Interior Minister Paulo Chachine told reporters that the police had a mission to prevent any attempt to disrupt the deal-signing ceremony.
He denied that there had been an attempt to kill Mondlane.
Sixteen people were injured, according to local civil society group Plataforma Decide. The BBC has not been able to confirm the casualty figures.
Mondlane's team said two children from a nearby school had died from the shooting. It said 16 people had been injured, including their camera person, with others seriously affected by tear gas.
In a statement, it said Mondlane's condition was ""unknown, and his whereabouts are causing concern among his entire team"".
A video shared on social media shows the moment when gunshots started ringing out as the procession approached what looks like an armoured vehicle on the streets. People run for safety and the crowds disappear, while the gunfire continues.
More images of people bloodied from the incident have also been shared online.
A witness, who was among the protesters, told the AFP news agency that police had started shooting, as if it was an ""ambush scenario. It was just a march"".
""I saw some people bleeding from their wounds. My friend was wounded in the leg. I also saw a child who was shot and lost his life in hospital,"" AFP quoted 27-year old protester Silvestre Alexandre as saying.
Mozambique's former colonial power, Portugal, has condemned ""the unacceptable attack on Venâncio Mondlane's convoy"" while calling for ""restraint from violence and respect for fundamental rights"".
In a post on X, the Portuguese foreign affairs ministry has also offered condolences to the bereaved families.
Since President Chapo took over in January, he has made promises for a broad political dialogue that would include various sectors of the society, in order to end the country's post-election crisis.
Some analysts have however criticised him for excluding Mondlane from the talks.
On Wednesday, Mondlane condemned the political deal, calling it ""an agreement of people without the people"". He said that protests would continue.
""If they don't do what the people want, they won't govern Mozambique,"" he said.
Since October, close to 400 people have died in violence linked to the protests, according to civil society organisations.

BBC News","The arrest of an army general from South Sudan's main opposition is a ""grave violation"" of the peace deal that ended a five-year civil war, an opposition spokesperson has told the BBC.
Gen Gabriel Duop Lam was arrested earlier this week, along with other senior officials of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO).
The detainees are all allies of Vice-President Riek Machar, whose rift with President Salva Kiir sparked a devastating war in 2013.
On Thursday morning, Machar's spokesperson said that the SPLM-IO did not know how their officials were or where they were being held.
""We are doing our best to avoid any escalation to the situation, however we need our partners in peace to demonstrate the political will to assure that this country will not go back to war again,"" Puok Both Baluang told the BBC's Newsday programme.
President Kiir has insisted that South Sudan will not return to war, government spokesperson Michael Makuei told reporters in the capital Juba on Wednesday.
Makuei added that the opposition figures were arrested because they were ""in conflict with the law"".
South Sudan is the world's newest nation, after seceding from Sudan in 2011. But just two years later, a civil war erupted when Kiir sacked his entire cabinet and accused Machar of instigating a failed coup.
After five years, with 400,000 lives lost, and 2.5 million people forced from their homes, a peace deal was agreed in 2018.
But it has been fraught ever since.
Gen Lam is in charge of the military wing of the opposition party, which is yet to be integrated into the army. He was taken into custody on Tuesday.
Another Machar ally, Oil Minister Puot Kang Chol, was taken by security forces in the middle of the night.
Machar's house in the capital, Juba, was surrounded by troops from the South Sudanese army overnight before they were later withdrawn.
All other senior military officials allied with Machar have been placed under house arrest, the BBC understands.
The arrests follow reports that the White Army militia had seized a strategic town in Upper Nile state close to the Ethiopian border, after clashes with government troops.
The White Army fought alongside Machar during the civil war.
Some in the army, loyal to Kiir, have accused Machar's allies of supporting the rebels.
Machar's spokesperson told the BBC that the current fighting between the White Army and security forces ""would have been avoided"" if the leadership of the national army had abided by the peace agreement.
The UN and African Union have warned that the violence in this area could potentially spread.
Ter Manyang, head of the Juba-based Center for Peace and Advocacy, told Reuters that the fighting in this area could threaten the peace deal.
""The country is likely to slide to war unless the situation is managed by the top leadership of the country,"" he said.
The country has never held an election - these are now due to take place in 2026 after years of delay.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr52vyepp8lo,Sexual harassment petition against Nigeria's senate president dismissed,2025-03-06T09:18:06.606Z,"Mansur Abubakar
BBC News, Abuja","The petition filed by a Nigerian senator alleging sexual harassment by the senate president has been dismissed.
Godswill Akpabio, one of the country’s most senior politicians, on Wednesday denied the allegations made against him by Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan.
The ethics committee which was mandated to look at the petition cited procedural violations and legal constraints at a hearing afterwards.
""The petition runs contrary to Senate rules and cannot be entertained,"" said chairman of the ethics committee senator Neda Imasuen.
He added that Uduaghan had personally signed the petition instead of having it endorsed by another individual, violating an order of the senate.
In an interview with Arise Television on Friday, Senator Uduaghan alleged that Akpabio had made inappropriate advances towards her during a visit to his residence in southern Akwa Ibom state, on 8 December 2023.
She further alleged that Akpabio had, on a separate occasion, insinuated that she should ""take care of him"" if she wanted her motions to receive favourable consideration in the senate.
The senator alleged that Akpabio was behaving like a university lecturer who consistently failed his student who had refused to sleep with him.
But this was denied by Akpabio.
""At no time did I ever harass any woman. I was raised very well by my late single mother, and I have always upheld respect for women. I was even awarded the most gender-friendly governor in Nigeria,"" he noted.
The issue has generated huge debate in Nigeria with many calling for an independent investigation.
In a social media post, one of Akpabio's predecessors as senate president, Bukola Saraki, said the issues raised were too serious to be simply brushed aside.
Earlier on Wednesday, two groups of protesters gathered at the assembly ground in the capital, Abuja - one backing Akpabio and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go.''
Senator Uduaghan used Wednesday's plenary session to submit the petition calling for an investigation into Akpabio's behaviour.
As the president, it was Akpabio who allowed Uduaghan to submit the petition.
Before becoming senate president less than two years ago, Akpabio was governor of the oil-rich Akwa Ibom state for eight years and also minister of Niger Delta affairs under former President Muhammadu Buhari.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnv6gpezjo,Nine things about Lesotho - the country 'nobody has ever heard of',2025-03-05T18:46:01.805Z,"Basillioh Rukanga
BBC News","US President Donald Trump has said that ""nobody has ever heard of"" the African country of Lesotho - a comment that has ""shocked"" its government.
It is a small country in southern Africa that almost entirely consists of mountains and is completely surrounded by South Africa.
Here are nine things to know about the country:
The Kingdom of Lesotho is made up mostly of highlands, where many villages can only be reached on horseback, by foot or light aircraft.
It is known as the ""Kingdom in the Sky"" and is the only independent state in the world that lies entirely above 1,000m (3,281ft) in elevation, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Its lowest point is at 1,400m.
It is known to have one of the world's most intimidating airstrips to land on - the Matekane Airstrip has a short runway and with long drops at both ends.
The Business Insider website describes flying from the airport as ""essentially the same as when a bird is pushed out of the nest in order to learn to fly"".
Lesotho is completely encircled by South Africa, but separated by the forbidding mountain ranges.
Not much of its land is available for farming, with its population vulnerable to food shortages and relying on income from jobs in South Africa. Over the decades thousands of workers have been forced by the lack of job opportunities at home to find work in South Africa.
The people of Lesotho, who number more than two million, share some cultural and language similarities with South Africans. Their language, Sesotho, is also one of South Africa's 11 official languages. In fact, more people speak it in South Africa - 4.6 million - than in Lesotho.
Resources are scarce in Lesotho - a consequence of the harsh environment of the highland plateau and limited agricultural space in the lowlands.
Its biggest resource is water - known locally as white gold - which is exported to South Africa. Diamonds are another major export.
When you think of skiing and snowboarding, you may imagine the snowy slopes of Europe and North America.
But Lesotho has been making itself known on the snowsports scene. It has the highest ski resort in sub-Saharan Africa, one of just a handful on the continent.
Afriski is situated 3,222m above sea level, high up in Lesotho's Maloti mountains and attracts visitors from Africa and beyond.
People from Lesotho are referred to as Basotho.
Some of the cultural items associated with the Basotho people are their blankets and the Basotho traditional conical hats, known as the mokorotlo. The hat is a national symbol and appears in the middle of the country's flag.
The blankets are made from thick wool, with their intricate and colourful patterns each telling a different story of the Basotho people's history. The Basotho wear them as shawls at special events and give them as gifts.
Lesotho has one of the highest rates of HIV prevalence in the world, with one in five adults living with HIV, and more infections per 100,000 people than most other countries, including neighbouring Namibia, Botswana and Eswatini.
The US government has committed nearly $1bn to help the country deal with HIV since 2006, including for prevention, care and treatment services, according to the US State Department.
Like the United Kingdom, Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. This means that although it has a royal family, an elected prime minister runs the country.
Lesotho's Prince Seeiso - the younger brother of current King Letsie III - is close friends with the UK's Prince Harry.
The pair have set up a charity in Lesotho - Sentebale, which means ""forget me not"". The organisation works with local communities in the country at grassroots level, helping young people affected by HIV/Aids.
Prince Harry first went to Lesotho as a 19-year-old and has returned to the country many times since then.
Jeans have long been associated with the American West but nowadays, many of the pairs worn in the US have come from halfway across the world, in Lesotho.
Lesotho's garment factories have made jeans for iconic American brands such as Levi's and Wrangler in recent years. As a result, Lesotho has become known as the ""denim capital of Africa"".
And it is not just jeans - Lesotho is one of sub-Saharan Africa's largest exporters of clothing in general to the US.
Last year, Lesotho exported $237m (£184m) worth of clothes and textiles to the US through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which allows eligible African countries to send some goods to the US without paying taxes.
It is ranked second by value of goods exported under the deal.
Many of Lesotho's clothing and textile factories are owned by Chinese and Taiwanese migrants.
The mountain kingdom has the world's highest suicide rate, with 87.5 people per 100,000 of the population taking their own life every year, according to the UN World Health Organization.
This is nearly 10 times the global average of nine and more than double the country with the second highest rate, Guyana, which has about 40.
There is no single reason for this shocking statistic - experts point to the abuse of drugs and alcohol, the shortage of jobs and the lack of mental health counselling.

BBC News, Johannesburg","Lesotho's government says it is shocked by US President Donald Trump saying that ""nobody has ever heard of"" the southern African nation.
Trump, addressing the US Congress in his first speech since his return to the Oval Office, made the reference as he listed cuts made to what he said was wasteful expenditure.
""Eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of,"" Trump said, eliciting laughter from some US lawmakers.
A spokesperson for Lesotho's foreign affairs department told the BBC that Lesotho enjoyed ""warm and cordial"" relations with the US.
Lesotho is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the US's African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which gives favourable trade access to some countries to promote their economic growth.
According to the US government, the two countries traded goods worth $240m (£187m) in 2024, mostly exports from Lesotho to the US, in particular textiles and clothing.
Lesotho's Foreign Affairs Minister Lejone Mpotjoane said it was ""shocking"" to hear a head of state ""refer to another sovereign state in that manner"".
""To my surprise, 'the country that nobody has heard of' is the country where the US has a permanent mission,"" Mpotjoane told the BBC.
""Lesotho is a member of the UN and of a number of other international bodies. And the US has an embassy here and [there are] a number of US organisations we've accommodated here in Maseru.""
He later told the AFP news agency: ""We are not taking this matter lightly,"" adding that they would send an official protest letter to Washington.
Officials dismissed Trump's remarks as ""off the cuff"" and a ""political statement"", adding that they were ""uncalled-for"" given the good relations between the two nations.
""We maintain very warm and cordial relations with the US. They've got a mission in Maseru and we also have [one] in Washington,"" foreign affairs spokesperson Kutloano Pheko told the BBC.
Mr Pheko was unable to confirm Trump's comments on the funding that went to LGBTQ organisations, saying that as the money went directly to them, they would be best placed to comment.
Mpotjoane, on his part, confirmed that the country had been affected by Trump's sudden decision to pause aid funding to countries around the world.
Many organisations, mostly non-governmental, were thrown into chaos after the Trump administration announced a permanent end to the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) funding as part of a wider cost-cutting drive to reduce US government spending.
Pepfar was launched in 2003 by then US President George W Bush and its finances are distributed via the US government's main overseas aid agency USAID, whose funding has also been cut.
Lesotho is among those countries that benefited from Pepfar, its health ministry told South African publication GroundUp in February, with TB and HIV programmes among those receiving the critical funds.
But Mpotjoane declined to criticise this decision, saying it was the US's ""prerogative to cut aid if they want to"".

BBC News","Dozens of people in the Sudanese state of North Darfur are feared dead following heavy shelling on a camp for displaced people.
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked a crowded market at Abu Shouk, a camp on the outskirts of the city of el-Fasher, for roughly two hours on Tuesday evening, a local official told the BBC.
The camp is home to over half a million displaced people and the assault on its market is the second in three days.
El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for almost a year.
Tuesday's attack on Abu Shouk took place at the busiest time of day. The camp's population are mostly Muslims, who are observing the holy month of Ramadan, and many were out shopping at the market, preparing to break their fast for the day.
The shelling caused several injuries, ranging from mild to severe, Dr Ibrahim Nadyan, a medic at el-Fasher's last functioning hospital, told the BBC.
Abu Shouk was also shelled by the RSF on Sunday, in an attack that that killed six civilians, local health volunteers said.
The RSF has not commented on either Sunday or Tuesday's attack.
Since it erupted in April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine.
Both the RSF and the army have been accused of committing atrocities, with the RSF accused of committed a genocide in Darfur against the region's non-Arabic groups.
The conflict has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east, while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south.
In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8vyl3j5kko,The region with more 'terror deaths' than rest of world combined,2025-03-05T05:51:08.038Z,"Harriet Orrell
BBC World Service","The Sahel region of Africa is the ""epicentre of global terrorism"" and now, for the first time, accounts for ""over half of all terrorism-related deaths"", according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI).
Its new report says that in this semi-arid area to the south of the Sahara Desert 3,885 people out of a worldwide total of 7,555 died.
The GTI report adds that while the global figure has declined from a peak of 11,000 in 2015 the figure for the Sahel has increased nearly tenfold since 2019, as extremist and insurgent groups ""continue to shift their focus"" towards the region.
The index is published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think-tank dedicated to researching global peace and conflict.
It defines terrorism as the ""threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation"".
The Sahel stretches from the west coast of Africa eastwards across the continent. The GTI's definition of the region includes parts of 10 countries: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, Guinea, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria, Chad and Mauritania.
The Sahel has some of the world's highest birth rates, and almost two-thirds of the population is under 25.
Unlike in the West where ""lone actor terrorism is on the rise"", the Sahel, has seen the rapid expansion of militant jihadist groups, according to the report.
It says most of the attacks there were carried out by two organisations: the Islamic State group affiliate in the Sahel and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) - a branch of al-Qaeda.
""They're trying to introduce new legal orders,"" explains Niagalé Bagayoko, chair of the African Security Sector Network. ""They're trying to administer justice in particular based on Sharia.""
And in the process, she says they ""are competing with one another"" for land and influence.
IS-Sahel has reportedly doubled the amount of territory it controls in Mali since the country's coups of 2020 and 2021 - largely in the east near its borders with Burkina Faso and Niger - while JNIM also continued to expand its reach, according to a UN panel of experts on Mali.
The GTI report notes that both groups have recruited more fighters, including child soldiers in the case of IS.
""In some instances, people tend to be in a point of choicelessness by the time they decide to join a militant group,"" says Beverly Ochieng, a senior analyst specialising in Francophone Africa at Control Risks, a geopolitical risk consultancy. ""These are communities that are very vulnerable.""
The GTI report explains how political instability and weak governance are creating ideal conditions for insurgent groups to grow, pointing to conflict as ""the primary driver of terrorism"".
The Sahel is sometimes referred to as the ""coup belt"" of Africa.
Since 2020 there have been six successful coups in the region as defined by the GTI report: two in Mali, two in Burkina Faso, one in Guinea and one in Niger. These countries are now all run by military juntas.
""The Sahel has experienced a breakdown in state society,"" says Dr Folahanmi Aina, an expert on the region at SOAS University in London.
""It's been informed by years of neglect from political leaders who haven't necessarily prioritised people-centred governance and local grievances have festered, resulting in terror groups trying to leverage these.""
There was a perception that civilian governments were unable to combat security threats from insurgent groups, ""but despite these juntas taking over, they haven't necessarily improved optics on the ground and in fact insecurity has worsened,"" says Dr Aina. ""The juntas are professionally unprepared for the rigours of governance.""
In fact in 2024, Burkina Faso ""remained the country most affected by terrorism for the second year in a row"" according to the GTI.
In the 14 years since the report began, it is the only country to top the list that is not Iraq or Afghanistan.
Jihadist groups sustain their operations in the Sahel with a range of illicit economic activities, including kidnap for ransom and cattle rustling, according to the GTI report.
The region has also become a key route for drug traffickers bringing cocaine from South America to Europe, and the report notes that ""drug trafficking represents one of the most financially lucrative illicit activities linked to terrorism in the Sahel"".
It points out that that some groups veer away from directly engaging in organised crime, however, preferring to ""make money by imposing taxes or providing security and protection in exchange for payment"".
It goes on to explain: ""This model not only generates revenue but also helps these groups integrate into local communities, strengthening their influence.""
Insurgent groups are also vying for control of the Sahel's rich natural resources. Niger is the world's seventh-largest producer of uranium, and unregulated artisanal gold mines found throughout the region are often taken advantage of by the likes of IS-Sahel and JNIM.
Following the recent wave of coups, Sahel governments have pivoted away from Western allies, such as France and the US, towards China and Russia for support in tackling militants.
""Right now we're seeing that Russia is taking more assertive control over Russian paramilitaries in the region known as the Africa Corps [formerly Wagner],"" says Ms Ochieng. ""Their work is to train and support the local armies to be able to counter the insurgency in the region, but so far it hasn't been effective.""
As a result, the GTI report warns that there is now a risk of overspill beyond the so-called ""epicentre of terror"" to neighbouring countries.
In fact, it says this may already be happening - Togo recorded 10 attacks and 52 deaths in 2024, the most since the index began. These were largely concentrated along the country's border with Burkina Faso.
Ms Ochieng agrees with this assessment, saying that ""the expansion of militant groups within the region in countries like Benin or Togo or other coastal West African states seems to be imminent"".

BBC News, Rugombo","Jordan Bita preferred to risk his life swimming across a roaring river than stay at home and be conscripted by rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The 25-year-old clung on to a black bin bag with some possessions as he used the strong currents to navigate his way across the Rusizi river, which forms the border between DR Congo and Burundi.
This was the last stage in a desperate journey to escape to safety in Burundi as the conflict in eastern DR Congo escalates, with M23 rebels capturing the cities of Goma and Bukavu in the last five weeks.
""I managed to flee safely… because I was crossing through the forest and moving along the bushes instead of the main road,"" he told the BBC after climbing up the bank on the Burundian side and wiping the water from his face.
""This is because M23 fighters are everywhere and they are forcing us to join them to fight against the government,"" he said.
Burundian troops are monitoring the riverbank in Cibitoke province in the north-west where Congolese families are crossing.
They are among nearly 70,000 people who have sought refuge here over the last month as the M23 rebels - backed by Rwanda, Burundi's neighbours to the north - continue to advance south in DR Congo.
At the end of January they took the major hub of Goma in DR Congo's North Kivu province and in mid-February Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, fell.
Mr Bita's luggage was thoroughly checked on the orders of Burundian troops - no weapons are allowed in.
Afterwards, he picked up his bag and carried it on his head, making his way up a steep hill to the nearest refugee camp about 12km (seven miles) away in the town of Rugombo.
He is bringing with him desperately needed food - maize meal, peanuts and beans - for his family who are already at a makeshift camp set up in the town's football stadium.
Another man, Amani Sebakungu, looked exhausted and was trying to catch his breath as he emerged from the Rusizi: ""In the river you just have to take heart and say if I die or survive so be it. God willed I crossed safely.""
As the BBC team was interviewing Mr Sebakungu, the Burundian military ordered us all to vacate the area as M23 rebels had been spotted marching towards the river on the other side.
Later, looking over from a nearby hill, we could see the rebels in military fatigues walking in single file and stopping the people on the Congolese side from making the crossing.
The dangers those fleeing face are real.
Over the last two weeks, at least 20 people have been swept away as they attempted to swim the 300m (984ft) across the river, which at certain points is 10m deep. It is thought many other drownings have gone unreported.
Clarice Kacindi lost her three-year-old child while crossing the Rusizi 10 days ago.
""One of my children was lying on the raft in front of me while I held three others beside me. We had many other people in the raft and when we reached the middle of the river the raft broke into two and my child was swept away,"" she told the BBC at Rugombo's football stadium.
""M23 are making our lives very difficult. They must stop this war. Even if I wanted to go back home, I'll be forced to start from scratch. They've stolen everything we left behind,"" she said.
Hundreds of white tents have been put up for shelter in the stadium as the paperwork of those seeking asylum is processed.
As many as 25 people share a tent, with many others sleeping under the stars. Food is rationed to only one meal a day.
Further south, the main border post between DR Congo and Burundi at Gatumba is also busy.
It is usually an hour's drive between the nearby Congolese city of Uvira and Burundi's main city of Bujumbura with the road humming with traders and vehicles.
Now it is only one-way traffic with refugees flowing into Burundi - mainly women and children.
Burundian security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that men were not being allowed over the border and were being told to remain in Uvira to defend the city from the M23.
Burundi has more than 10,000 troops deployed in DR Congo helping the military there fight the M23.
Many of their soldiers are now based in Uvira, which has a population of more than 300,000.
It is located on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika and is now on high alert as M23 rebels are marching south from Bukavu and are reportedly 70km away.
Burundi has been a natural ally of DR Congo over years because of its enmity with Rwanda.
Relations between Rwanda and Burundi have long been hostile, with both accusing each other of trying to overthrow their respective governments.
The countries share a similar language and ethnic make-up - with Tutsi and Hutu communities often vying for power - and both have suffered terrible ethnic-based massacres.
But unlike Rwanda, which is headed by a Tutsi president, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi.
Burundi's government fears that if the M23 cements its presence in South Kivu by taking Uvira it will strengthen a Burundian rebel group called Red Tabara.
Based in South Kivu, it is mainly made up of Tutsis - and has attacked Burundi in the past.
""It is terrible for Burundi. This is the first time in more than 20 years for the country to receive this large number of refugees,"" Brigitte Mukanga-Eno, an official from the UN refugee agency, told the BBC.
""We need to support this country in receiving the refugees to improve the conditions of those that are still making their way to Burundi so that there are no clashes between the refugees and host communities.""
Eighty-seven-year-old Magega Mwarui can attest to the years of unrest in the region, often triggered by ethnic rivalries.
""I have fled to Burundi so many times. We cross this river carrying the little belongings we have left,"" the Congolese woman, who has lost her sight, told BBC in Rugombo.
""Since I was young, before I turned blind… There've been times where I almost drowned while fleeing conflict,"" she said.
Charlotte Odile, who is now living at a camp just outside Rugombo set up for those who have been officially registered as refugees, told us she came to Burundi with her four children after her husband was shot dead by M23 rebels in South-Kivu.
""I'm hoping to find a home for my children and peace,"" she said.

BBC News","Warning: This article contains details of sexual violence that some people may find distressing
Armed men are raping and sexually assaulting children as young as one during Sudan's civil war, says the UN children's agency, Unicef.
So traumatised are the survivors that some say they have attempted to end their lives.
Mass sexual violence has been widely documented as a weapon of war in the country's nearly two-year conflict.
But Unicef's report is the first detailed account about the impact of rape on young children in Sudan.
A third of the victims were boys, who typically face ""unique challenges"" in reporting such crimes and seeking the help they need.
Unicef says that, although 221 rape cases against children have been officially reported since the start of 2024, the true number is likely to be much higher.
Sudan is a socially conservative country where huge societal stigma stops survivors and their families from speaking out about rape, as does the fear of retribution from armed groups.
The Unicef report provides an appalling window into the abuse of children in the country's civil war.
Perhaps its most shocking revelation is that 16 of the victims were under the age of five years, including four infants.
Unicef does not say who is responsible, but other UN investigations have blamed the majority of rapes on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), saying RSF fighters had a pattern of using sexual violence to terrorise civilians and suppress opposition to their advances.
The RSF, which is fighting this war against its former allies, the Sudanese Armed Forces, has denied any wrongdoing.
""Children as young as one being raped by armed men should shock anyone to their core and compel immediate action,"" said Unicef executive director Catherine Russell.
""Millions of children in Sudan are at risk of rape and other forms of sexual violence, which is being used as a tactic of war. This is an abhorrent violation of international law and could constitute a war crime. It must stop.""
According to evidence presented by international human rights groups, victims in the RSF's stronghold of Darfur were often targeted because they were black African rather than Arab, apparently with the aim of driving them out of Sudan.
The UN humanitarian response for Sudan is already underfunded. Recent cuts in US aid are expected to reduce programmes to help the victims even further.
Harrowing details in Unicef's report underscore the dire situation.
""After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,"" recalls Omnia (not her real name), an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls.
""Every time they raped her, this girl would come back covered in blood. She is still just a young child. They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious. Each of them cries and speaks incoherently. During the 19 days I spent there, I reached a point where I wanted to end my life.""
Unicef says the attacks included armed men storming homes and demanding that the girls be surrendered, raping some of them in front of their loved ones.
Victims were sometimes left with serious injuries and unwanted pregnancies.
In addition to the 221 rapes reported by Unicief were an additional 77 cases of sexual assault against children - mostly attempted rape.
As a fractured nation at war, Sudan is one of the most challenging places on earth to access services and frontline workers.
""The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering,"" said Mohamed Chande Othman, chair of the UN's fact-finding mission when its previous report was published in October.
The vast number of people displaced by the war has made women and children more vulnerable to attack – three out of four school-age girls are out of school, the UN says.
The devastating outcome of these crimes is aggravated by the fact that victims have few places to turn to for medical help, because many medical facilities have been destroyed, looted or occupied by the warring parties.
Recent US aid cuts may be endangering even the limited services available to protect children.
Unicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities.
The activists relied quite heavily on US aid, and most have been forced to shut down, according to a Sudanese coordinating committee that monitors them.
More broadly, the UN organization dedicated to protecting women's rights says local organisations led by women are vital in delivering support to survivors of sexual violence. But they receive less than 2% of the total funding of the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Fund.
The BBC learned that at least one of these local groups, known as ""She Leads"", was forced to close when US funding was stopped.
It was not a big expense, measured in the tens of thousands of dollars, but enabled case workers to reach around 35 survivors a month, said Sulaima Elkhalifa, a Sudanese human rights defender who runs a government unit on combatting violence against woman and helped organize the private initiative.
Those who have been raped by armed men ""don't have the luxury of being depressed,"" she told the BBC.
The demands of war – finding food, needing to flee – leave no space to deal with trauma, she added.

BBC News","Gabon's military leader Gen Brice Oligui Nguema has announced his intention to run for president in next month's election.
Nguema seized power in 2023 in a coup that ended the long-standing rule of the Bongo family. He then pledged to hand over power to civilians.
The country has however since passed a new constitution and electoral code that critics argue were designed to favour a bid for the presidency by the junta leader.
Nguema told the Gabonese people on Monday that he had decided to run in the 12 April election ""after careful reflection and in response to your many appeals"".
Addressing supporters during a heavy downpour in the capital, Libreville, he declared his readiness to change the fortunes of the oil-rich country.
""I am a builder and I need your courage, your strength, to build this country,"" the the coup leader, who had just turned 50, said.
The announcement followed months of speculation about his intentions to officially occupy the country's top seat.
On Saturday, Nguema told the military in a meeting that he was aware of their desire to see him run in the election and urged them to vote.
He told the defence forces he had heard their calls. ""I listened to you and, believe me, I understood you,"" adding, ""I will get back to you within the next few days"".
There has been speculation that Nguema had left the army, as a requirement to run for the presidency – but that has since been denied by his spokesman.
A Facebook page associated with Nguema clarified on Monday that he was required to abandon his military uniform temporarily while running for election.
The page, Infos CTRI Officiel, said that he would have to permanently leave the military if he won the election. ""If he's not elected, he will return to the barracks,"" it said.
The Nguema-led junta is credited for ending 55 years of the Bongo dynasty.
Ali Bongo had ruled for 14 years before he was toppled. He took office after the death of his father, Omar Bongo, who had been president for 41 years.
Last month, the president of neighbouring Equatorial Guinea, Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, encouraged the Gabonese people to support Nguema for a better future for their country.
Some opposition and civil society groups in Gabon have however been urging the military leader to honour his word and leave power to civilians after the transition.
Despite Gabon's oil wealth and vast forests, one third of its 2.4 million people live below the poverty line, according to the UN.

BBC News, Accra
Jake Lapham
BBC News","A group of 10 MPs in Ghana have resubmitted a controversial bill that would impose some of the toughest restrictions on LGBT rights in Africa.
The bill prescribes a three-year jail term for people who identify as gay, and five to 10 years for promoters and advocates.
The legislation was passed by parliament last year, but the former President, Nana Akufo-Addo, declined to sign it into law before leaving office in January, citing legal challenges.
It has been widely condemned by both local and international human rights groups, with some describing it as draconian.
At the dissolution of the previous parliament ahead of last December's general election, all bills that had not completed the legislative process, including receiving the president's signature, were dropped.
It is unclear whether the speaker of the new parliament will admit the bill for consideration.
Gay sex is already punishable by up to three years in prison in the conservative West African country.
President John Mahama has said he would prefer the bill to be state-sponsored, ensuring broader support and consultation.
""I do think that we should have a conversation on it again so that all of us, if we decide to move that bill forward, move it forward with a consensus,"" he said.
Supporters claim the legislation would help preserve what they consider to be Ghanaian culture and family values.
However rights groups have decried the legislation.
""The anti-LGBT rights bill is inconsistent with Ghana's long-standing tradition of peace, tolerance, and hospitality and flies in the face of the country's international human rights obligations,"" said Human Rights Watch researcher Larissa Kojoué last year.
""Such a law would not only further erode the rule of law in Ghana, but could also lead to further gratuitous violence against LGBT people and their allies.""
Va-Bene Elikem Fiatsi, a Ghanaian trans woman and LGBT activist, told the Reuters news agency the bill's reintroduction was ""disheartening and hard to process"" but insisted LGBT activism would continue.
The bill's potential impact on Ghana's economy is a significant concern.
The country's former finance minister warned that passing the bill could result in Ghana losing up to $3.8bn (£2.9bn) in development funding from the World Bank and affecting its $3bn (£2.3bn) IMF support programme.
Opposition lawmaker John Ntim Fordjour told Reuters the country no longer needed to fear economic sanctions, citing the election of Donald Trump as US president.
""The global political climate is favourable for conservative values as demonstrated in the bold conservative pronouncements of President Donald Trump,"" he said.
The bill was first introduced to parliament in 2021 but has faced many delays.",Africa

BBC News","Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says the writer's block she experienced after becoming pregnant with her first child was ""terrifying"".
""It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning,"" the acclaimed Nigerian author, 47, tells the BBC's Emma Barnett.
""I'm not sure that it was just entirely physiological but something changed, and I just could not get back into that magical place where I can write fiction.""
Adichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Last year, she had twin boys, now 11 months old.
While she was pregnant, she had a ""very foggy feeling"" and ""couldn't think as clearly,"" she says.
""I'm a person for whom thinking clearly is so important, and so to be in that kind of place emotionally is very frightening,"" she says.
Adichie is now releasing her first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count.
The book tells the story of four women navigating lives that aren't going to plan.
""I couldn't write for a while, and then I started writing again,"" she says.
Adichie is known for work that explores themes including feminism, gender and immigration. The novelist's 2012 Ted Talk We Should All Be Feminists helped push her to greater prominence, and was even sampled by Beyoncé on her 2013 song Flawless.
In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, she speaks about topics including parenthood, grief and artificial intelligence (AI).
Adichie's beliefs about gender have led her to reflect on how she'd like to bring up her sons. ""I'm determined to raise good men,"" she says.
""I want to raise my boys to be emotionally comfortable, to be in touch with emotion, to not be afraid of emotion, and also to not be afraid of fear,"" she continues.
Compared to girls, Adichie believes boys don't have many ""wholesome"" role models. ""This space is just occupied by noxious characters and ideas,"" she says.
The writer adds that she wants her sons to be ""the kind of boys that never start a fight but if you bring a fight to them, they will beat you up"".
As well as having her three children, since writing her last novel, Adichie has also lost both of her parents.
""Grief recedes but only in waves and then, at some point, it comes back,"" she says.
Adichie was surprised by how physical grief felt. ""Your heart really is very heavy, you feel as though your body is somehow no longer able to carry the weight of your heart,"" she says.
The novelist says that grieving for her mother, who died suddenly on her father's birthday in 2021, had a role in shaping her new novel.
When she started writing the book - after her mother died - ""I did not think I was writing about my mother,"" she says. But when she had nearly finished, she reread the manuscript and realised there was ""so much about mothers and daughters"" in it, even though she hadn't been conscious of this while writing.
""I felt very strongly that, in some ways, my mother had opened the door for me to get back into this magical place that means that I can write fiction,"" Adichie says. ""I kind of thought that she's comforting me, and it was actually deeply emotional for me to make that realisation.""
As someone with a deep emotional connection to the creative process, it is perhaps unsurprising that when the conversation turns to AI, Adichie has a strong stance.
The author says that we should not refer to any written content produced by generative AI produces as stories and that the technology is going to make all of us, if we embrace it widely, ""increasingly stupid"".
She argues that AI could limit human creativity, something she says ""we should never think that we can somehow replace"".
Even using AI for tasks like summarising work emails can be damaging, she says.
""The ability to summarise is something that requires a certain level of creativity and imagination and intelligence, and it just seems to me that if you're ceding that to something else, what are we going to let our brains do for us?""

BBC News, Abuja","The Islamic police in the northern Nigerian state of Kano have arrested Muslims seen eating and drinking publicly, as well as those selling food at the start of Ramadan, when Muslims are supposed to fast from dawn until dusk.
The deputy commander of the Hisbah, Mujahid Aminudeen, told the BBC that 20 people had been arrested for not fasting and five for selling food, and that the operations would continue throughout the month, which began on Saturday.
""It is important to note that we don't concern ourselves with non-Muslims,"" he said.
Mr Aminudeen said any ""disrespect"" for Ramadan would not be condoned.
""It's heart-breaking that in such a holy month meant for fasting, adult Muslims would be seen eating and drinking publicly. We won't condone that and that's why we went out to make arrests,"" he said.
He said all 25 had been charged in a Sharia court and would be punished accordingly.
The Hisbah official added that they sometimes get tip-offs when people are seen eating.
""We do get calls from people who are enraged after seeing people eating in public and we act fast by going to the area to make arrests.""
He also confirmed the arrest of other people who were seen with ""inappropriate haircuts"", wearing shorts above the knee and tricycle drivers mixing male and female passengers.
Last year, those arrested for not fasting were freed after promising to fast, while the relatives or guardians of some of them were summoned and ordered to monitor them to make sure they fast.
Those arrested this year were not so lucky as they will have to face the court.
Just over two decades ago, Sharia, or Islamic law, was introduced to work alongside secular law in 12 of Nigeria's northern states that have a majority Muslim population. Sharia does not apply to the Christian minorities living in the states.
Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, has a special significance in Islam.
It is during this month that Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran - Islam's holy book - were revealed to Prophet Muhammad.
Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which lay the basis for how Muslims are required to live their lives. The fast is observed during daylight hours.
Ramadan usually last 29 or 30 days, and is expected to end on Sunday 30 March.

BBC News, Johannesburg","The mother of a six-year-old girl who disappeared more than a year ago in South Africa has gone on trial accused of organising her kidnapping.
Kelly Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn were arrested after Smith's daughter, Joshlin, went missing from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, in February last year.
Joshlin's disappearance sent shockwaves across South Africa and despite a highly publicised search for her, she is yet to be found.
All three have pleaded not guilty to charges of human trafficking and kidnapping.
Ms Smith initially said that Joshlin had gone missing after she left the young girl in Mr Appollis's care.
Prosecutors later accused her of having ""sold, delivered or exchanged"" the six-year-old and lied about her disappearance.
An intense and widespread search then ensued for the young girl but attention soon turned to Ms Smith after her friend and former co-accused, Lorentia Lombaard, turned state witness, according to South Africa's Daily Maverick news site.
Her search even attracted the interest of Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie, who offered a reward of one million rand (£42,500; $54,000) for her safe return.
The trial will run from 3-28 March at the Saldanha multi-purpose centre, which has been repurposed into a high court specifically for the case.
A judge presiding over the case earlier this year explained that the location was selected to ""ensure the community has access"" to proceedings throughout the marathon trial.

BBC News","The West African regional bloc, Ecowas, says a mission deployed to Guinea-Bissau to help resolve an election dispute has left the country after the president threatened to expel it.
The team was sent in last month to help reach a ""political consensus"" on how to hold elections this year.
Guinea-Bissau's general elections had been scheduled for last November but President Umaro Sissoco Embalo postponed them. He has since announced 30 November this year as the new date.
The opposition has opposed the delay and said Embalo's term should have expired last week, although a Supreme Court ruling recently extended his term in office to September.
In a statement on Sunday, Ecowas said its team had met Embalo, other politicians and civil society groups to try to reach a consensus on when the elections should be held.
Ecowas said its team, together with the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (Unowas), had been deployed to the country from 21-28 February.
It said it had ""prepared a draft agreement on a roadmap for elections in 2025 and had started presenting it to the stakeholders for their consent"".
The team however ""departed Bissau in the early morning of 1st March, following threats by [President] Umaro Sissoco Embalo to expel it"", it said.
The president has not responded to the bloc's accusation.
The bloc says it will now present its report to the Ecowas president, including a proposal for an agreement leading to ""inclusive and peaceful elections"".
Embalo was elected for a five-year term in December 2019, and the standoff over when it should end has heightened tensions in a country that has experienced several military coups since independence in 1974.
There have been two attempts to overthrow Embalo, the latest in December 2023.
This led him to dissolve the opposition-dominated parliament.
The opposition on Thursday called for a nationwide strike, on the day they said the president's term was expiring, with the government deploying security forces across the capital.
A day earlier, Embalo visited Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvz5g420mdo,DR Congo defies pressure over talks with rebel M23,2025-03-03T01:55:20.029Z,"Anne Soy
Senior Africa correspondent, BBC News, Nairobi","Despite growing international pressure, the Democratic Republic of Congo is standing firm on its decision not to have direct talks with the M23 rebel group that has made major advances in the east of the country in recent months.
Last week, the UK government added to calls for the group to be part of an ""inclusive dialogue"" to help find a political solution to the conflict.
But in an interview with the BBC, DR Congo Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka said her government wants to negotiate with neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of backing the M23.
At least 8,500 people have been killed since fighting escalated in January, according to the Congolese authorities.
Hundreds of thousands have also been forced from their homes amid the chaos triggered by the fighting, in which UN experts and others see Rwanda as having a key role.
""The fact remains that the aggressor of the territorial integrity and of the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Congo is Rwanda,"" Suminwa Tuluka said, citing a UN experts' report from last year that stated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops had crossed into Congolese territory and were fighting alongside the M23.
Peace talks brokered by Angola hit a deadlock last December after Rwanda demanded that the Congolese government talk directly to the M23.
The rebel group then advanced swiftly, taking control of the cities of Goma and Bukavu in January and February.
At a joint East and Southern African mediation effort last month, regional leaders called for a ceasefire, the exit of ""uninvited foreign armed forces"" from Congolese territory and also urged for direct negotiations between ""state and non-state parties... including M23"".
Rwandan President Paul Kagame did not deny the presence of his troops in DR Congo when asked about it. ""I don't know,"" he said in a CNN interview.
The conflict across the border has seen his country, often viewed as a darling of the West, now lose favour fast across the board.
Pressure is mounting on it to withdraw its forces from Congolese soil.
""But it has not yet effectively done so,"" Suminwa Tuluka said.
She welcomed US sanctions imposed on Rwandan government minister James Kabarebe, saying they would help ""put pressure on the aggressors"". Rwanda, however, dismissed them as ""unjustified and ineffective in resolving the crisis"".
The European Commission for its part has suspended ""defence consultations"" and placed ""under review"" a memorandum of understanding it signed last year with Rwanda on raw materials.
The Congolese prime minister welcomed the EU Commission's decisions, saying that ""the illegal exploitation of resources - that is one of the causes of the conflict"".
DR Congo accuses Rwanda of illegally exploiting its mineral deposits in the east of the country, which Rwanda denies.
Adding to the chorus against Rwanda, the UK said last week that among other measures it would pause aid except the money meant for the poorest and most vulnerable groups, unless the country withdraws its troops, engages ""meaningfully"" in talks and a ceasefire is achieved.
Rwanda described the decision as ""punitive"", saying it was unreasonable to expect it to compromise its national security.
The Congolese prime minister said that Rwanda was ignoring all the calls to withdraw its troops.
""So, who is standing in the way of [resolving the conflict]? It is not the Congolese government,"" she argued.
Rwanda has previously acknowledged deploying its forces ""defensively and offensively"" during the ongoing conflict, claiming the right to defend its territory.
It has also repeatedly accused the Congolese government of harbouring and working with the militant group the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose members include fighters from the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Asked about that, Suminwa Tuluka denied that the Congolese army works with FDLR rebels, but said her country would engage in a process of ""neutralising"" the militants.
When it came to what would solve the problem if direct talks with the M23 were ruled out, the prime minister said that along with negotiating with Rwanda, the answer was simple for what would guarantee a ceasefire.
""Ensure that Rwandan troops withdraw from Congolese territory and that their M23 stop killing the Congolese populations,"" she said.

""Kinembe"" is Swahili for ""clitoris"". ""Inbox me"" instructs the viewer to send a private message over TikTok with a more explicit bespoke request - such as to watch the performer masturbating, stripping or performing sexual activities with other women.
In some of the livestreams we watched, coded sexual slang was used to advertise sexual services.
The emoji gifts act as payment for the TikTok livestreams and - because TikTok removes any obvious sexual acts and nudity - also the more explicit content sent later on other platforms. The gifts can be converted into cash.
""It's not in TikTok's interest to clamp down on soliciting of sex - the more people give gifts on a livestream… [the] more revenue for TikTok,"" says a Kenyan former moderator we are calling Jo - one of more than 40,000 moderators TikTok says it employs globally.
We discovered that TikTok is still taking about a 70% cut from livestream gifts. The company denied it took such a large commission after we established the same cut in a 2022 investigation.
TikTok has long been aware of child exploitation in its livestreams - having run its own internal investigation in 2022 - but ignored the issue because it ""profited significantly"" from them, according to the claims of a lawsuit brought by the US state of Utah last year.
TikTok responded that the lawsuit - which is ongoing - ignored the ""proactive measures"" it had made to improve safety.
Kenya is a hotspot for this abuse, says the charity ChildFund Kenya, compounded by a young demographic and widespread internet usage. The African continent as a whole also has poor online moderation compared to Western countries, the charity added.
Jo, who worked for Teleperformance - contracted by TikTok to provide content moderation - says moderators are given a reference guide of banned sexual words or actions. But this guide is restrictive, says Jo, and does not take into account slang or other provocative gestures.
""You can see by the way they are posing, with the camera on their cleavage and thighs [for example], that they are soliciting sex. They may not say anything, but you can see they are signposting to their [other platform] account, but there's nothing I can do.""
Another content moderator for Teleperformance, who we are calling Kelvin, says moderation is also limited by TikTok's increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), which he says is not sensitive enough to pick up on local sexual slang.
Jo and Kelvin are among seven current and former content moderators working on TikTok content who told us their concerns. Jo says about 80% of livestreams flagged in content moderators' feeds were sexual, or advertising sexual services, and TikTok is aware of the scale of the issue.
ChildFund Kenya and other charities have told the BBC that children as young as nine are taking part in these activities.
We have spoken to teenage girls and young women who say they are spending up to six or seven hours a night on the activity and making on average £30 a day - enough to pay for a week's food and transport.
""I sell myself on TikTok. I dance naked. I do that because that's where I can earn money to support myself,"" says a 17-year-old we are calling Esther. She lives in a poor Nairobi neighbourhood, where 3,000 residents share toilet facilities. She says the money helps her buy food for her child, and support her mother who has been struggling to pay the rent since Esther's father died.
She says she was 15 years old when she was introduced to TikTok Lives by a friend, who helped her bypass the age restrictions - only over-18s can use a Live. Users also need at least 1,000 followers to go live.
So TikTok users with a big following can act as digital pimps - hosting the livestreams selling sexual content. Some of them have back-up accounts, indicating they have been banned or suspended by TikTok in the past.
They appear to know how to evade detection by TikTok's content moderators, while generating the right amount of sexual teasing to pique customers' interest.
""When you're dancing, move away from the camera, otherwise you'll get blocked,"" shouts a pimp to a woman twerking on screen.
In return for being hosted, the women give pimps a cut of their earnings.
The relationship can quickly turn exploitative, says Esther. She says her digital pimp knew she was under 18, and ""he likes using young girls"".
He put pressure on her to earn more - meaning she needed to livestream more frequently - and took a larger cut of her earnings than she expected, she says.
""So if an emoji is sent which is 35,000ksh (£213), he takes 20,000ksh (£121) and you only get 15,000ksh (£91).""
Working for him was like being in ""handcuffs"" she says. ""You are the one hurting because he gets the biggest share and yet it is you who has been used.""
""Sophie"", not her real name, who says she was also 15 when she started livestreaming on TikTok, says she got requests from men in Europe for services on third-party platforms, including from one a German user who would demand that she caress her breasts and genitals for money.
Now 18, she regrets her online sex work. Some of the videos she sent to users via other platforms were then uploaded to social media without her consent, she says.
Her neighbours found out, and warned other young people not to associate with her, she told the BBC.
""They brand me as a lost sheep, and young people are told that I'll mislead them. I am lonely most of the time.""
Some of the girls and women we spoke to said they had also been paid to meet TikTok users for sex in person, or had been pressured into having sex with their pimps.
TikTok is keen to establish itself in African markets, but is not employing enough staff to effectively monitor content, the content moderators in Kenya told us.
Kenya's government has shown signs of acknowledging the issue - in 2023, President William Ruto held a meeting with TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew to call for better content moderation on the platform. The government said the company had agreed to tighter regulation, with a TikTok office in Kenya to help co-ordinate operations.
But the moderators we spoke to said, more than 18 months later, neither had happened.
Teleperformance replied that its moderators ""work diligently to tag and flag user-generated content based on community standards and client guidelines"" and that its clients' systems are not set up to allow Teleperformance to remove offending material or report it to law enforcement authorities.
A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC:
""TikTok has zero tolerance for exploitation. We enforce strict safety policies, including robust Live content rules, moderation in 70 languages, including Swahili, and we partner with local experts and creators, including our Sub-Saharan Africa Safety Advisory Council to continually strengthen our approach.""

BBC News
Will Ross
BBC World Service Africa editor","The army of the Democratic Republic of Congo has accused Rwanda of dressing up prisoners in military uniforms in an effort to pass them off as newly-captured rebels linked to the Rwandan genocide.
It comes after Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo said they had captured fighters from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) - a militia founded by ethnic Hutus who took part in the 1994 genocide against Rwanda's Tutsis.
But the DR Congo military said a video allegedly showing the handover of 20 FDLR rebels at a border crossing was ""faked"".
M23 fighters have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.
The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN.
In its statement, the Congolese military said the Rwandan video was a ""faked incident in poor taste orchestrated with the sole aim of discrediting our army"".
It said Rwanda had taken old FDLR prisoners and dressed them in new military uniforms to claim they had been newly captured in Goma.
""This is part of the Rwandan strategy to justify the invasion of parts of the DRC's territory,"" it added.
Rwanda has used the presence of FDLR forces in eastern DR Congo to justify its support for the M23.
The country previously denied backing the M23, but it has also stressed that due to the FDLR presence in eastern DR Congo it has a right to take military action there.
UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.
UN experts also reported last year that the Congolese military had been using several armed groups, including the FDLR, as proxies in the fight against the M23.
The genocide in Rwanda took place over 100 days in 1994.
The ethnic Hutu militia involved in killing up to 800,000 people - the vast majority from the Tutsi community - fled to what is now DR Congo, some forming the FDLR.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who headed the rebel Tutsi force that ended the killing more than three decades ago, sees this ""genocidal militia"" as an existential threat.
On Thursday, gunfire and explosions ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east. Videos showed chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled.
M23 rebels seized Bukavu from government forces last month following their rapid advance through the region.
The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of an alliance of rebel groups that includes the M23.
The rebels accused DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi's government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on ""a foreign army"" that he said was operating in the east.
The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control.",Africa

BBC News","Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party will not stop opposing a deal that would hand over the Chagos Islands, despite it receiving a favourable hearing from US President Donald Trump.
The proposed agreement would cede the Indian Ocean islands - which house a strategically important joint US-UK military base - to Mauritius, which has claimed sovereignty over them. The military base would then be leased back.
Badenoch told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: ""It is not in our national interest to give [them] away and pay for the privilege of doing so.""
A Downing Street spokesman said it welcomed that Trump had recognised ""the strength of this deal"".
Negotiations between the UK and Mauritius were started by the Conservatives in 2022, but an agreement to hand over the archipelago - known officially as the British Indian Ocean Territory - was announced by the Labour government in October.
It has prompted criticism since being announced, as it would see the UK lose the islands while providing Mauritius with annual payments to take them over.
There were also concerns - voiced by Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio - that handing the islands to a nation increasingly affiliated with China posed a ""serious"" national security threat.
The government says striking a deal was necessary to secure the future of the joint military base, known as Diego Garcia, while resolving the legal dispute over the ownership of the islands.
It also gave Trump a veto over the deal - but the US president said he was ""inclined"" to agree to it during a meeting with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday.
However, Badenoch has remained adamant that the Tories will not change their views about the deal.
""We will not stop our opposition to the surrender of the Chagos Islands, we will continue,"" she said, adding that the financial aid for Mauritius under the terms of the deal was ""taxpayers' money"".
""That is money which the prime minister seems to have confirmed is coming out of the defence increase that he has just announced. That's terrible,"" she added.
The deal has been put on hold since December while awaiting approval from the Trump administration, and after the then-newly elected prime minister of Mauritius said he had reservations about it.
Ahead of his meeting with the US president, Sir Keir came under fire from Badenoch after newspaper reports claimed that the effective price tag for carrying out the deal had jumped from £9bn to £18bn.
The government had earlier said the figures were ""entirely inaccurate"".
But Trump said of the deal that he had ""a feeling it's going to work out very well"" during the cordial White House visit.
""They're talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years actually,"" Trump said. ""That's a long time.""
Under the Chagos plan, the UK is expected to lease Diego Garcia - which is well positioned for military operations in Asia and the Middle East - for 99 years, with the option of a 40-year extension.
No specific timeframe for the deal going ahead has yet been released, but a Downing Street spokesman has said it is ""progressing"".
The UK will still need to work with the Mauritian government to finalise the deal and put it before Parliament for approval.",Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e63930qxo,How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdom,2025-03-02T03:04:28.631Z,"Farouk Chothia
BBC News","The love life of South Africa's Zulu king has the country agog - and has scandalised his socially conservative subjects as he messes with tradition by seeking a divorce.
Polygamy is part of Zulu culture, but King Misuzulu kaZwelithini has taken the unusual step of going to court to divorce his first wife, Queen Ntokozo kaMayisela.
""Everyone was puzzled. People were not expecting the king to go so far as to file for divorce,"" Prof Gugu Mazibuko, a cultural expert at South Africa's University of Johannesburg, told the BBC.
""In Zulu culture, there is no divorce. You are not supposed to chase away your wife,"" she said.
Regarded as the ""lion of the nation"", the Zulu king is the custodian of age-old traditions that place marriage and polygamy at the heart of royal success.
His role within South Africa may only be ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential, with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars.
The monarch - who grew up in neighbouring Eswatini, studied in the US and came to the throne in 2021 - seems to court controversy.
His coronation was challenged in court by his elder half-brother, who has been trying to snatch the crown from him.
His second marriage appears to be shaky, his attempt to take a third wife hit the buffers and there are also reports of another dalliance with a young princess.
However, the 50-year-old's troubled personal life used to be discussed in hushed tones - that is until he filed divorce papers in December.
Prof Mazibuko acknowledged that historical records appeared to suggest that a Zulu monarch in the 20th Century had divorced one of his queens, but it had been a ""top royal secret"", given royal divorce is not the norm.
""If a marriage does not work out, the wife will still live in the king's homestead. She will be given her own space. She will not have a relationship with the king, but she and her children will be well-cared for.""
It was just before his accession to the throne - following the sudden death of his father and mother four years ago - that the then-Prince Misuzulu married Ntokozo Mayisela.
The two were already a couple and had two children together, but according to another cultural expert, Prof Musa Xulu of the University of Zululand, the decision to marry appeared be be hurried.
""It seems as though he felt he could not be a king without a wife,"" he told the BBC.
Queen kaMayisela came from an ""ordinary family"" - as many of the wives of Zulu kings do - in a small mining town in KwaZulu-Natal province.
It was as a cabaret singer performing at a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban that she caught the royal eye, the academic said.
Her senior status in the family was made clear at the king's state coronation in December 2022 when she sat by his side.
But her position is now under threat, with the monarch saying in court papers that they have not lived as husband and wife for at least year and their marriage has irretrievably broken down.
The palace followed this by sending out invitations for the king's wedding to a new bride, Nomzamo Myeni, set to take place in late January. The bride-price, known as lobola, had already been paid in cattle - a prized asset in Zulu culture.
Queen kaMayisela did not take any of this lying down, instituting separate court action to halt the wedding, which was postponed as a result.
Her argument was that the king - known to his subjects as ""Ingonyama"", meaning Lion - would be committing the offence of ""bigamy"" without first ""converting"" his civil marriage to her into a traditional Zulu marriage.
But the judge threw out her case, saying she had had a ""turnaround"" in attitude as she had already agreed her husband could take other wives.
He noted the monarch had already done so - marrying Nozizwe kaMulela, the MD of Eswatini Bank, in 2022.
Prof Mazibuko explained that polygamy was not initially part of Zulu culture, in fact the first two kings were bachelors.
But it was embraced by their successors - King Misuzulu is the ninth monarch of the Zulu nation - and has become part of Zulu culture.
""That's how we build families, especially the royal family,"" Prof Mazibuko said.
Queen kaMulela comes from an influential family in Eswatini and the marriage was apparently arranged to strengthen the ties between the royal families.
Yet it is unclear whether the pair are still in a relationship, as the high-powered banker has not been spotted at Zulu cultural events for a while - with speculation their final marriage rituals have not been completed.
The current king's various marriage problems seem to stem from the fact that tradition has not been properly followed.
In the case of the first wife, he opted for a modern-day marriage, without a traditional wedding.
""For a marriage to be perfected under Zulu custom, there has to be a public gathering, with song and dance,"" Prof Xulu said.
""You, as the bride, must lead with a solo song and the bride-maids dance with you, and you carry a spear which you give to the king - and then there is no going back.""
This has left Queen kaMayisela without the protection of tradition - and only the offer of monthly maintenance of $1,100 (£850) for a year, though she was likely to demand more before returning to the life of a commoner, Prof Xulu said.
In the case of the second wife, the academic said lobola had been paid in January 2022, but royal insiders suggest the king felt ""those who went to pay didn't have the authority to do so"" - plus this union has not been marked with a public ceremony.
The fortunes of the would-be third wife, Nomzamo Myeni, remain unclear as the king failed to marry her in January despite the court giving the go-ahead.
Prof Xulu said that in Zulu culture a ""postponed"" marriage usually never takes place.
Though Ms Myeni is still being seen with the king, accompanying him to a state event last week where she was referred to as a queen, suggesting their wedding may take place once the king's divorce goes through.
Yet as a commoner she would bring no powerful connections with her, which may be why one of the monarch's aides recently confirmed to local media there was ""a new queen-to-be"" - Sihle Mdluli, who hails from the royal family of a small ethnic group in South Africa.
The aide suggested she might be named ""the mother of the nation"" - a title that would make her the most senior queen with her children likely heirs.
But Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if that wedding also failed to take place, as the king's relationships all seemed to run into trouble.
""I am not sure whether he was ready to be king, and whether he has good advisers,"" the academic said.
He pointed out that the monarch had also been behaving erratically in his public life, sacking several senior officials in his retinue.
On top of this, he has installed himself as the chairman of the board of a financially lucrative land trust, of which he is the sole trustee.
The trust was controversially established shortly before South Africa became a democracy in 1994, giving it control of about 2.8 million hectares (seven million acres) of land in KwaZulu-Natal.
King Misuzulu has also suspended all members of the board, bar one, accusing them of being uncooperative.
He did this against the advice of the government, which pointed out that as chairman he would be required to account to parliament about the trust's operations - something that would not be in keeping with his status as a constitutional monarch.
The dispute remains unresolved, giving the government a major political headache as it tries to avoid going head-to-head with the king.
Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if at some point a powerful rival faction within the royal family launched a fresh bid to dethrone him by asking the courts to rule that he is not ""fit and proper"" to be king.
The monarch's half-brother, Prince Simakade Zulu, who is the late king's eldest son, has long coveted the crown, but his backers were outmanoeuvred by Misuzulu's allies in succession discussions.
President Ramaphosa later gave Misuzulu a ""certificate of recognition"", paving the way for him to be funded by the government.
But Prince Simakade's supporters did not give up - going to the High Court to declare his state coronation ""unlawful"" - and won.
The court ruled that President Ramaphosa had failed to comply with the law, which required him to order an investigation into objections to Misuzulu's accession.
The status quo remains, pending the outcome of an appeal.
The scandals have the potential to weaken the king's position should it come to another tussle for the crown.
Though Prof Mazibuko noted there had always been fierce competition for the Zulu crown - except these days it takes place in court instead of a bloody battlefield.
""He is not the first king to go through a lot,"" she said. ""I hope he survives, and everything settles down.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2019ez78pvo,'End of era' for Africa as Namibia buries founding father,2025-03-01T12:14:55.560Z,"Damian Zane
BBC News","Namibia's founding father Sam Nujoma was ""a giant among leaders"" and left behind ""the most precious gift of… freedom"", the country's President, Nangolo Mbumba, has said.
He was speaking in front of the large crowd at Heroes' Acre, where the country's most revered citizens are buried, before Nujoma was laid to rest in a mausoleum.
The leader of Namibia's independence struggle against apartheid South Africa died last month at the age of 95.
Nujoma was seen as the last of a generation of African figures who headed anti-colonial movements and fought for freedom.
""Therefore his departure signals an end of an era, a founding father of Africa,"" President Mbumba said in an earlier speech at a national memorial service on Friday.
""We are not only mourning today, we are celebrating an extraordinary leader who has contributed significantly to our country's independence, who will continue to inspire us for many more years to come,"" Namibian Given Shiyukifein told the Reuters news agency.
On Saturday, Nujoma's coffin, draped in the Namibian flag, was driven by a military gun carriage from the centre of the capital, Windhoek, where the body was lying in state, to the burial ground on the outskirts of the city.
Mourners had been arriving since the early hours, the independent Namibian newspaper reported.
It added that they waved flags and sang songs in his memory, including Sam Ouli Peni? (Sam, Where are you?) – a popular anthem from the period after independence in 1990.
Among the dignitaries present were the presidents of neighbouring countries Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
Nujoma, one of 10 children from a peasant family, was working on the railway in the late 1940s when he got a political education. He developed a passion for politics and yearned to see his people free from the injustice and indignity of colonialism.
He led the long fight for freedom from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, and helped found the liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s.
As the country's first president – a position he held for 15 years until 2005 - Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability. His policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy.
He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock.
Namibia, then known as South West Africa, was under German occupation from 1884 until 1915, when Germany lost its colony in World War One.
It then fell under the rule of white South Africa, which extended its racist laws to the country, denying black Namibians any political rights, as well as restricting social and economic freedoms.
The introduction of sweeping apartheid legislation led to a guerrilla war of independence breaking out in 1966.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgne2v4p12o,DR Congo conflict: 500 mpox patients flee clinics after rebel looting,2025-02-28T21:07:07.318Z,"Dorcas Wangira
BBC Africa health correspondent","More than 500 mpox patients have fled clinics in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo over the last month amid the current conflict.
Officials at Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a leading health agency on the continent, have said they are worried as the missing patients risk spreading the highly contagious disease that is suspected to have killed at least 900 people in DR Congo last year.
The patients fled from facilities in Goma and Bukavu - two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks.
""We were looted. We lost equipment. It was a disaster,"" Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.
Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever.
According to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.
Dr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.
His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.
At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.
Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.
The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.
They were given 72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging ""voluntary returns"".
""Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to,"" Dr Muhindo said.
His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.
""Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions,"" Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDC's mpox incident manager, said on Thursday.
Over the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory.
Dr Ngongo added that a new variant of mpox with ""high potential for higher transmissibility"" had also been detected in DR Congo.
The country's ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congo's army, as well as a lack of funding.
The mpox facility at Mugunga, funded by the UN children's agency (Unicef) and BrItish government aid, managed to reopen last week.
But it is already so overstretched that there are times when four or five patients have to share one bed.
""I first fled from Minova to Goma when the M23 rebels began to advance from there,"" Sadiki Bichichi Aristide, a 23-year-old being treated at Mugunga along with two of his children, told the BBC.
""I began to fall sick in a [camp for displaced people]. It started with my fingers, and then I had lesions, which began to rupture on my hands. My neighbours told me to go to Mugunga with my children. I left my wife behind.""
He said he had seen ""so many"" people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week.
Dr Oummani Rouafi, Unicef's Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters.
But this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said.

BBC News","Gunfire and explosions have ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in a city they recently captured in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled the rally in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east, in panic.
Casualty figures are unclear, but AFP news agency has quoted a hospital source as saying that at least 11 people have been killed and 60 others are wounded.
This was the first rally that the Rwanda-backed rebels were holding in Bukavu since taking the city from government forces earlier this month following a rapid advance through the region.
The rebels accused President Felix Tshisekedi's government of orchestrating the attack.
However, Tshisekedi blamed it on ""a foreign army"" that he said was operating in the east.
The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of the alliance of rebel groups that includes the Rwanda-backed M23.
He promised the crowd that the rebels would bring safety and security to the city.
""There will be special units and patrols that will take place in all the communes,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.
It is believed that Nangaa and Bertrand Bisimwa of M23 had already left when the attack took place at Bukavu's main square.
In a statement, Nangaa said that two people had been apprehended in connection with the attack, and a search was under way for other suspects.
""This cowardly and barbaric act will not go without consequences,"" he said.
The rebels have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.
The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN.
The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control.
Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security.
UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.

The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent.
As well as receiving training, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that they have researched, with the report broadcast to the BBC's global audiences.
Known for championing robust, dynamic journalism, Dumor made a significant impact on Africa and the rest of the world.
The BBC is committed to continuing his legacy through the award by empowering journalists from Africa to tell original and nuanced African stories to international audiences.
Rukia Bulle from Kenya was last year's winner.
During her placement, she travelled to a Senegalese village to report on the Baye Fall, an unorthodox Muslim minority who are often misunderstood by others in the wider faith.
Jonathan Munro, BBC News global director and deputy CEO, said: ""We are proud to launch this year's BBC News Komla Dumor award and the search for the next recipient.
""Marking its 10th anniversary is a testament to Komla Dumor's powerful legacy of reporting on African stories with depth, insight and integrity.
""Past winners of the award reflect the exceptional talent across the continent so I look forward to welcoming this year's winner and strongly encourage journalists to apply.""
Dumor was the presenter of Focus on Africa, the BBC's first-ever dedicated daily TV news programme in English for African audiences. It was broadcast on BBC World News, which has now merged with the BBC News Channel to create a single 24-hour TV news service.
He was also one of the lead presenters for BBC World News' European morning segment.
He joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of broadcast journalism in his native Ghana where he won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award.
Between 2007 and 2009 he hosted Network Africa on BBC World Service, before joining The World Today programme.
In 2009 Dumor became the first host of the African business news programme on BBC World News, Africa Business Report. He travelled across Africa, meeting Africa's top entrepreneurs and reporting on the latest business trends around the continent.
In 2013 Dumor featured in New African magazine's list of the 100 most influential Africans.

BBC News, Accra","A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online.
It provides a vital service, as last year's internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged.
Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling.
It was the Léon Thévenin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years
""Because of me, countries stay connected,"" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC.
""IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,"" he says.
""You have heroes that save lives - I'm a hero because I save communication.""
His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the Léon Thévenin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment.
The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen.
Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent.
Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore.
""As long as the servers aren't in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it's accessing Facebook or any other online service,"" says Benjamin Smith, the Léon Thévenin's deputy chief of mission.
Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity.
""The cable generally doesn't break on its own unless you're in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,"" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship's remotely operated vehicle (ROV).
""But most of the time it's people anchoring where they shouldn't and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.""
Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic.
""In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,"" he says.
Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the Léon Thévenin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves.
A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship's anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.
Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia.
Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks.
Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again.
Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables.
""There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there's a problem,"" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship's chief of mission.
There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level.
The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable.
The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged.
If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable.
But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet.
At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage.
In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is.
When the problem is with the cable's insulation - known as a ""shunt fault"" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost.
After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team.
Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor.
About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully.
""It doesn't sink,"" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction.
The ROV's three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed.
Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship.
Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC.
Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated.
When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the Léon Thévenin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship's location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges.
""Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,"" Mr Wallerand says.
On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year.
""It's part of the job,"" says Captain Thomas Quehec.
But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices.
They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more.
Adrian Morgan, the ship's chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries.
""I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,"" he says.
Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son's wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission.
""I've heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn't have a mum,"" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago.
""But I'm retiring in six months,"" he adds with a smile.
Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard.
When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship's mess hall.
Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background.
While Mr Goeieman followed his father's footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime.
""I was involved in gangs when I was younger,"" Mr Smith says, ""My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.""
Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent.
""We are the link between Africa and the world,"" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y5j49xgyo,"UK suspension of aid is 'punitive', Rwanda says",2025-02-26T12:51:01.462Z,"Wedaeli Chibelushi
BBC News","The UK's decision to suspend some aid to Rwanda is ""punitive"", authorities in the East African country have said.
In a statement, the UK said it was against Rwanda's support for the M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising.
Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security.
More than 7,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the conflict escalated in January, DR Congo's government says.
The UK said the humanitarian situation in DR Congo was ""critical"" and that it would halt bilateral aid to Rwanda, ""excluding support to the poorest and most vulnerable"".
Earlier this month, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Rwanda receives about £32m ($40m) of bilateral aid from the UK every year.
Along with the suspension of aid, the UK will impose other measures, such as looking into potential sanctions and suspending ""future defence training assistance"", the statement said.
These measures will last until ""significant progress"" is made in ceasing hostilities and withdrawing Rwandan military personnel from DR Congo, it added.
UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.
Rwanda's foreign ministry said the ""punitive measures"" announced by the UK government ""in response to the conflict in eastern DRC - where the UK has now clearly chosen a side - are regrettable"".
""The measures do nothing to help the Democratic Republic of Congo, nor do they contribute to achieving a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern DRC.""
The UK has previously enjoyed good relations with Rwanda. In 2022, the two countries signed a multi-million pound deal, in which some asylum seekers arriving on British soil would be deported to Rwanda.
The deal faced legal challenges and was scrapped last year after a change in the UK's government.
DR Congo's government has been campaigning for international powers to suspend aid and impose sanctions on Rwanda.
Last week, the US Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration, James Kabarebe.
The US accused Kabarebe, a former army chief, of being central to Rwanda's support for M23.
Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controlled in France and the UK, the US Treasury said.
Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions were ""unjustified"".
The M23 says it is fighting to achieve better rights for the Tutsis, an ethnic minority group in DR Congo, and to bring order to a failed state.
The rebels have captured eastern DR Congo's two biggest cities, Goma and Bukavu.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn914g249o,Sudan military plane crashes in residential area,2025-02-26T11:54:00.146Z,"Basillioh Rukanga
BBC News","At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says.
The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians.
The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction.
The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur.
The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced.
The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash.
A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying.
Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports.
The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added.
Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle.
The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south.
In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gn417300o,'They took all the women here': Rape survivors recall horror of DR Congo jailbreak,2025-02-25T17:38:48.519Z,"Orla Guerin
BBC News, Goma","Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start.
""He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me.""
Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January.
""I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life,"" Pascaline tells the BBC.
He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out.
Her attackers came over the wall from the men's block right next door called ""Safina"", she says.
""We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped.""
Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region.
Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail.
Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.
By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources.
A UN official told the BBC that ""at least 153 women had perished"", quoting ""reliable sources in the prison"".
A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands.
She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead.
She walks through the main yard of the women's section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head.
""At one point I didn't know what was happening any more,"" she says. ""It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved.""
Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft.
Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it.
""When I sleep at night, everything I've seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here.""
Nadine says she was also raped by two men.
""They came with alcohol,"" she tells the BBC. ""They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here.""
The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held.
Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.
""I don't think that justice can exist in Congo,"" she says. ""I condemn the way the government is running things.""
The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east.
Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children's clothing.
Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them. Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day.
It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence.
She says ""children started to die"" when tear gas was fired into the women's section.
""The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,"" Florence says.
""When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,"" she adds.
The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else.
Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces.
However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates.
""You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women's prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.""
Florence says she heard ""bullets crackling"" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.
""If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation.""
Some of the prisoners who broke into the women's section were looking for a safer escape route, she says.
They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed. But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.
Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body.
""People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn't count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,"" Florence tells the BBC.
She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.
""The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out.""
The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one.
Florence says the women's prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors. They were offered no help.
""Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,"" she says.
By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling.
The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison.
In a tent in the grounds of Goma's hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend.
She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine.
But her agony is more than physical.
Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison.
""I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don't know what. She died on the spot,"" Sifa tells the BBC.
She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was ""without sin"". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother's side.
How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter?
She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence.
The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out.
Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison.
""No-one will follow [this case],"" Sifa says. ""No-one will be pursued. It's already over.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70ekeln92eo,Tinubu ex-ally criticises Nigeria reforms,2025-02-25T17:19:28.020Z,"Mansur Abubakar
BBC News, Abuja","One of the architects of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu's 2023 election victory has criticised the reforms being carried out by his government.
In an interview with Arise TV, Nasir El-Rufai said the president's decision to import food to lower prices would impoverish the country's farmers.
In response, presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga said that even though El-Rufai had worked hard for Tinubu's election, it was time for him to move on from the disappointment of not being made a minister.
The 65-year-old, one of the founding members of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, was tipped to be one of Tinubu's most influential ministers before his nomination was declined by parliament.
""You don't address food inflation by destroying domestic agriculture,"" said El-Rufai.
""Food prices may be going down, but farmers are being impoverished because they are being made to compete with subsidised agricultural products from Europe and other countries,"" he said.
""I have issues with many of them [Tinubu's policies], and I'm in touch with many senior officials of the administration, and I give them my opinion privately.""
The former minister also said his party had abandoned its founding values and internal democracy, warning he might leave if reforms were not made.
El-Rufai also said he had supported Tinubu in 2023 not because he was the best but because the 72-year-old was the candidate of his party.
""As a loyal party man, I was duty bound to support the party's candidate,” he noted.
He also spoke about his nomination as a minister which was later turned down by the senate over a security report.
""The idea that the National Assembly rejected me is not true. The decision was made by the president himself. Either he changed his mind, or some other factors influenced him. Regardless, I have moved on,"" El-Rufai said.
The politician, who has been seen with opposition figures recently, did not rule out moving to another party before the next general elections in 2027.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyj1198wy3o,"Claims of white genocide 'not real', South African court rules",2025-02-25T16:59:07.600Z,"Khanyisile Ngcobo
BBC News, Johannesburg","A South African court has dismissed claims of a white genocide in the country as ""clearly imagined"" and ""not real"", undermining comments made by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk.
The ruling came as the court blocked a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen.
Grantland Michael Bray wanted to bequeath $2.1m ( £1.7m) to the group to help it ""further its messages of racial hatred and separation"".
But the court ruled this request was invalid, vague and ""contrary to public policy"".
Trump has referred to the ""large-scale killing of farmers"" in South Africa, while Musk has condemned what he said were ""racist ownership laws"" and previously condemned the ""genocide of white people"".
Despite vowing to crack down on immigration, Trump has said that white South African farmers would be allowed to settle in the US as refugees because of the persecution he said they faced.
Musk was born and grew up in South Africa before moving to the US.
The court action was brought by Mr Gray's four siblings, who are also trustees and beneficiaries of the family trust.
In it, they claimed that their brother had become ""obsessed with the idea of an impending genocide of white people in South Africa"" in the last 10 years of his life.
He died in March 2022.
Mr Gray, who was paralysed following an accident aged 26 while doing military service, had also become paranoid, believing the supposed ""genocide"" would occur soon.
""That idea was further fuelled by his already present racism and the online content that he was exposed to,"" Judge Rosheni Allie summarised in a 15 February ruling that has just come to light.
Mr Gray first met members of the Boerelegioen in 2020 and allegedly gave them about $326,000 (£258,000) in gold coins to help fund their cause and gain membership of the racist group.
The Boerelegioen describes itself as a ""civil defence movement that enables citizens to resist the promised slaughter of whites in RSA [Republic of South Africa] as well as the theft of their property"".
Mr Gray subsequently made the organisation a beneficiary to his estate, specifying that a portion of the money go towards the various training programmes the group ran.
But because there were three entities all bearing the Boerelegioen name, the court found that Mr Gray's bequest made was ""vague concerning which entity was the intended beneficiary"" of his will.
""The only expression of the [Mr Gray's] intention that is evident is the intention for the funds to be used for 'training' as well as [his] own assertions that he wanted the funds used to benefit an organisation which he deemed to be one which will exterminate every black person in South Africa and will be used to defend or ward off a white genocide, which is clearly imagined and not real,"" Judge Allie said.
On the public policy issue, Mr Gray's siblings contended that Boerelegioen wanted to use the funds to ""further... its messages of racial hatred and separation"".
Boerelegioen says it simply provides security and training services to communities and does not exclude anyone on the basis of race, gender or religion.
Judge Allie ruled in favour of the siblings and ordered Boerelegioen to pay the costs in the court case.
Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order freezing financial aid to the country over a new law allowing for land seizures by the South African government under certain circumstances.
The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.
But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.
South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024.
Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.
In contrast, 961 women were murdered alongside 273 children.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e7dkld09zo,Uganda probes death of Nigerian footballer in shopping mall,2025-02-25T16:23:51.476Z,"Basillioh Rukanga
BBC News","Police in Uganda are investigating the death of a Nigerian professional footballer who allegedly fell from a shopping mall in the capital, Kampala.
Abubakar Lawal, 29, reportedly fell from a third-floor balcony at the Voicemall Shopping Arcade, where he had gone to visit a Tanzanian friend. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead, the police said.
They said Lawal's friend, identified as Omary Naima, had left him in her room - which is part of the mall building - preparing tea before the incident happened.
Lawal was a striker playing for local team Vipers Sports Club, which has expressed its sadness for the ""untimely passing of our beloved player"".
Tributes have been flowing in for the Nigerian forward, fondly known as ""Man from Sokoto"".
He has been with Vipers since July 2022 after a two-year stint with AS Kigali in Rwanda.
In 2023, he helped Vipers win the league and cup double. In a post on X, the club said: ""Lawal (Man from Sokoto) was a unique person"".
""He had a big heart of gold. He really cared about people and went out of his way to help. He was incredibly generous.""
His former team in Nigeria, Nasarawa United, said: ""We mourn the sudden demise of our ex-player Abubakar Lawal earlier today. May God grant him eternal rest.""
Ugandan footballer Mustafa Kizza said he would be forever missed: ""It's hard to take in that you're no more Lawal A kind, talented, jolly, and loving person you have been.""
Local media say the matter has left more questions than answers amid conflicting reports over the circumstances of Lawal's death.
Some media initially reported that he had died in a motorcycle accident.
As a result of such ""contrary information"", Nigeria's authorities should probe the incident, Nigerian international Ahmed Musa said on social media.
He added: ""Lawal's soul deserves a thorough investigation and justice must be served if anyone is found guilty.""
Police in Uganda said they were already investigating the exact circumstances of the death.
""Authorities are retrieving CCTV footage and conducting thorough interrogations to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident,"" police said.
The police have retrieved some items belonging to the deceased player, including two smartphones, shoes, headsets and a training kit.
""Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses,"" the police added.

BBC News, Abuja","Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993.
A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend.
Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time.
Here are four takeaways from the book:
This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.
In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.
The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.
The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.
Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.
Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote.
However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.
""That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,"" Babangida writes.
At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country’s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.
Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later.
Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.
Abiola’s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.
""Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,” he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.
Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections.
General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.
""We were very close friends,"" Babangida recalls.
""We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.""
However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.
""With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.""
Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.
""I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,"" he writes.
Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.
The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an ""Igbo coup"" - a label Babangida rejects.
He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.
The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.
The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.
Babangida writes: ""It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.
""For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.""
The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war.
Many Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.
""She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced,"" he writes.
""We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.
""I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,"" Babangida says.
He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7x87ev5jyo,'People will starve' because of US aid cut to Sudan,2025-02-25T00:16:28.781Z,"Barbara Plett Usher & Anne Soy
BBC News, Nairobi","The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned.
Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.
It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.
The conflict between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.
The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.
""People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,"" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. ""People are screaming from hunger in the streets.""
The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was ""serving US interests"", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.
The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.
The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance - on which the communal kitchens depend - will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.
The closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.
The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID.
It is a ""huge setback"" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who has set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms.
The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN.
Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works.
""It was ground-breaking,"" says Ms Tracy. ""The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets [humanitarian group] in Syria.""
For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.
There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege.
Most of the kitchens had closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon ""we expect to see a lot of people starving"".
Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID.
""I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],"" she said, ""but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was.""
""These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,"" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation.
They are ""exhausted, traumatised and underfunded"" and ""we were scaling up to help them"".
The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful.
""The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,"" it said in response to a BBC query.
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances.
In 2024 the US was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan.
Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries.
""I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,"" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month.
The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further.
""We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,"" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director.
He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. ""We are strained. It's extremely difficult.""
They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, ""it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger"", says Ms Dagesh.
Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority.
""But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,"" she said.
Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people.
They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing.
Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape.
Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods.
They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight.
With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders.
Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained.
The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise ""to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum"".
It does not help that the agency was already underfunded.
The UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut ""everything"", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive.
The US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo.
""We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,"" Mr Balde told the BBC.
Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on ""very dangerous journeys"", he says.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8nzpwnn4o,US star John Legend defends playing Rwanda concert during war,2025-02-24T14:59:14.241Z,"Natasha Booty in London & Anita Nkonge in Kigali
BBC News","American singer-songwriter John Legend has told the BBC he is unfazed by a public backlash against his decision to perform in Rwanda, despite the country's involvement in the war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.
""I don't believe that we should punish the people of Rwanda and punish the people of other countries when we disagree with their leaders,"" he said after last week's concert in Kigali.
In recent weeks, M23 rebels, backed by Rwanda, have seized the two largest cities in the mineral-rich east of the DR Congo.
There is evidence Rwanda has sent 4,000 troops across the border to support the rebels.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are now destitute having fled their homes, and shocking violence, including the rape of children, has skyrocketed.
Critics argue that Legend could have made a powerful statement by pulling out of the concert, especially given his highly respected ""EGOT"" status as someone who has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.
Fellow Grammy-winner Tems did pull out of a concert she was due to give on Saturday in Rwanda, saying she would ""never, ever intend to be insensitive to real-world issues"".
But Legend defended his decision to headline the Move Afrika event in Kigali, which was run by the Global Citizen NGO and attracted thousands of fans from across the continent.
He said he was not being paid for the performance but felt it was his duty to help ""grow touring capabilities"" on the African continent, which is often overlooked by international stars on so-called world tours.
""I'm aware of what's happening [in DR Congo] and I'm aware of the calls there have been for me to not do this show, but I really believe that the mission of Move Afrika is still important,"" he told the BBC.
Delighted fans at the sold-out show agreed, but the social media backlash was ferocious enough to force Legend to delete an Instagram post he had made promoting the event.
Belgium-based activist Denise Zanesa had argued that ""performing under the banner"" of Rwanda ""would be akin to collaborating with oppression itself"", in a message posted to X (formerly Twitter).
It was a sentiment echoed by others, including Simone Umba in the US, who wrote in a TikTok video caption: ""So are we ready to talk about Rwanda's use of Black American culture in their soft campaigning to normalise their terrorising of eastern Congo?""
Taking a political stance would have been nothing new for the star.
Legend is outspoken in his criticism of US President Donald Trump. He also severed ties with former mentor Kanye West when he ran for president, suspecting it was part of a wider Trump campaign to ""siphon"" black people's votes away from the Democrats.
The debate over Rwanda's relationship with popular global figures is also not new.
Most recently, Rwanda has been accused of ""sportswashing"" - with critics saying it uses the feel-good factor of international football to cover up alleged human rights abuses at home.
The East African nation is said to receive $1bn (£800m) a year in foreign aid and its tourism arm - Visit Rwanda - has lucrative sponsorship deals with Arsenal in England, Bayern Munich in Germany and Paris St-Germain in France.
When asked his thoughts on the topic, Legend's aide told the BBC that he would not answer that question.
It appears that, as far as Legend and his team are concerned, his music itself should do the talking.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ne8zz3pdo,Kenya receives 17 rare antelopes from the US,2025-02-24T14:14:58.228Z,"Basillioh Rukanga
BBC News, Nairobi","Kenya has received 17 mountain bongos - a very rare type of antelope - from a conservation centre in the United States.
The antelopes are third-generation descendants of mountain bongos taken from Kenya in the 1960s.
The return of the critically endangered animals, from the Rare Species Conservation Foundation in Florida, was hailed as a ""monumental step"" in Kenya's conservation efforts.
From about 500 in the 1970s, less than 100 mountain bongos are estimated to remain in the wild in Kenya, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).
This was due to habitat loss, poaching, illegal activities, disease and small fragmented populations, the KWS said.
Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano described the arrival of the bongos at the country's main airport on Sunday night as ""emotional and so cool"", and a benefit for Kenya's tourism and conservation sectors.
The animals were taken to wildlife sanctuaries in Meru county near Mount Kenya, where they will be nurtured before they are gradually introduced to their natural habitat.
Ms Miano said the mountain bongo, ""a species originally only found in Kenya, has suffered untold grief over the decades... dwindling to alarming proportions"".
She said the plan was to grow the population to 700 by 2050.
The mountain bongo, which has a bright chestnut-red colour with narrow white stripes, is the largest African forest-dwelling antelope, according to the KWS.
It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a Critically Endangered species - with more individuals in captivity than in the wild.
The first repatriation to Kenya was in 2004 when 18 mountain bongos were flown into the country.
KWS director-general Erastus Kanga said Kenya was expecting another batch of the mountain bongos from zoos in Europe in the next three months.
From captivity, the bongos have to go through a series of adaptation phases for them to build the immunity needed to survive in the wild.
In 2022, the head of conservancy at Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy (MKWC) told a Kenyan TV station that some of the bongos repatriated in 2004 had successfully been integrated into the wild and had started breeding.
The MKWC official, Robert Aruho, however, said that others had died from tick-borne diseases, adding that building immunity takes time.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8ve60r53yo,Sudan army ends two-year siege of key city,2025-02-24T14:01:00.336Z,"Basillioh Rukanga
BBC News","The Sudanese army says it has broken a near two-year siege imposed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the key southern state capital of el-Obeid.
The breakthrough came hours after the RSF signed a political charter in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to establish a breakaway government in areas under its control.
The RSF and the army have been in a vicious battle for power since April 2023, with tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced from their homes.
The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south.
El-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state, is a strategic hub connecting the capital, Khartoum, to Darfur. This is the latest army advance in recent weeks following the recapture of several parts of Khartoum from the RSF.
There was jubilation on the streets as Sudanese soldiers marched into the city.
A military spokesman, Nabil Abdallah, confirmed the gains in a statement, saying army forces had destroyed RSF units.
Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim said the move was a ""massive step"" in lifting the RSF siege of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, and would also allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to Kordofan.
Sudanese civil society activist Dallia Abdlemoniem told the BBC Newsday programme that the recapture of the city "" was ""huge"" and ""significant"".
She said the RSF had ""held the civilians captive for nearly two years"" in the city.
The situation there was ""horrific"", she said, adding that there had been no medical or food aid in an area considered ""to be very risky in terms of famine and malnutrition"". She said she hoped more aid would now be allowed in.
""Lifting the siege brings life back to the city,"" Ahmed Hussein, a 53-year-old trader in el-Obeid, told the AFP news agency.
Ms Abdelmoniem said the army was ""making serious groundwork in terms of moving towards the west, which is where the RSF is mainly centred"".
The latest fighting around el-Fasher has forced medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to halt operations at Zamzam, a famine-stricken camp nearby, which houses about 500,000 displaced people.
MSF said it was a ""heartbreaking decision"" but it had ""little choice"" because it was too dangerous for its staff to operate there.
Both the army and the RSF have been accused of committing grave atrocities against civilians during the war, with their leaders being sanctioned by the US. In addition, RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide in Darfur.
Both deny the accusations.
Kenya's hosting of the RSF last week as it sought to form a parallel government was criticised by some human rights groups.
On Sunday, Sudan's Foreign Minister Ali Youssef said his country would ""not accept"" any country recognising ""a so-called parallel government"".
Earlier, Sudan's military government had warned it would take retaliatory measures against Kenya and has since recalled its ambassador from Nairobi.
In response, Kenya's foreign ministry said there was ""no ulterior motive"" in ""providing non-partisan platforms to conflict parties"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70q5wjjl4yo,The Kenyans saying no to motherhood and yes to sterilisation,2025-02-24T01:31:47.325Z,"Danai Nesta Kupemba
BBC News","For as long as Nelly Naisula Sironka can remember she has never wanted children - and with one irreversible decision the 28-year-old Kenyan has ensured she never will get pregnant.
Last October, she took the definitive step of undergoing a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation - permanently closing the door on motherhood.
""I feel liberated,"" the organisational development expert tells the BBC, adding that it has ensured her future is now entirely her own.
The operation prevents pregnancy by blocking a woman's fallopian tubes and is sometimes referred to as ""getting your tubes tied"".
Between 2020 and 2023, roughly 16,000 women in the East African country underwent tubal ligation, according to Kenya's health ministry.
It is unclear how many of these women didn't already have children.
Yet Dr Nelly Bosire says the kinds of women coming forward seeking sterilisation in Kenya is changing.
""Traditionally, the most common candidates for tubal ligation were women who already had multiple children,"" the Nairobi-based gynaecologist told the BBC.
""But now, we are seeing more women with fewer children opting for the procedure.""
Sterilisation is only recommended for women who are certain they do not want to have biological children in the future, as reversal is difficult.
""Doctors don't typically encourage tubal ligation because the success rate of a reversal is very poor,"" said Dr Bosire.
Despite coming from a large family, Ms Sironka said she never felt pressured to start her own - though societal norms in Kenya do place an expectation on women to have children.
She credits her father with her stance as he encouraged her to focus on education - and gave her a love of reading.
Books by US feminist authors like Toni Morrison, Angela Davis and bell hooks were a revelation.
""I interacted with women's life stories that didn't feature children at all,"" said Ms Sironka, who is now the chief of operations at Feminists in Kenya, an organisation which works to end gender violence.
""It made me realise that a life like this was possible.""
She had contemplated sterilisation for years, but decided to go ahead after saving up the money for the operation and finding herself in a stable job that allowed her to take time off.
It cost her 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£190; $230) at a private hospital.
Ms Sironka felt that women's rights were being eroded around the world - especially as women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which also influenced her decision.
It made her fear that a woman's right to control her own body might be eroded elsewhere - and that she should do the procedure while she still could.
""Within Africa and in America, there has been a rise in fascism and authoritarian regimes, a perfect example of such is Kenya,"" she argued.
When she told her family, it did not come as a surprise to them, as she had always been very vocal about her desire for a child-free life.
And as for dating and relationships?
""I'm still thinking about it,"" she said with a shrug.
And Ms Sironka is not alone in choosing a child-free life, challenging traditional expectations of womanhood.
Across social media, there are those speaking openly about their choice not to have children and undergo sterilisation.
Among them is Muthoni Gitau, an interior designer and podcaster.
She shared her tubal ligation journey in a 30-minute YouTube video last March, explaining her decision to have the procedure.
""I think the first time I ever articulated... [that] I did not want to have children, I was about 10,"" she told the BBC.
Her mother was heavily pregnant at the time, and a random question about her future popped into the conversation.
""I saw a possible partner. I saw travelling. I just never saw children,"" she said.
Like Ms Sironka, Ms Gitau's decision was driven by a strong conviction to live life on her own terms.
After trying birth control pills, which she said made her nauseous, she sought a more permanent solution.
When she first approached a doctor about tubal ligation at the age of 23, she was met with resistance.
She was given what felt like a sermon about how children were a blessing from God.
""He asked me, 'What if I meet someone who wants kids?'"" she said.
The doctor seemed to have more consideration for an ""imaginary person"" rather than the actual patient sitting in front of him, she said.
Ms Gitau said the dismissal was ""heart breaking"". It was another decade before her wish was finally granted.
Dr Bosire points out that a significant challenge in Kenya is getting medics to shift their mindset and truly appreciate a patient's right to make decisions about their health.
""This ties in with our culture, where people believe it isn't normal for women to want a tubal ligation,"" she said.
Another Kenyan gynaecologist, Dr Kireki Omanwa, admitted the issue was a matter of debate amongst colleagues and in medical circles.
""It remains inconclusive,"" he told the BBC.
But Ms Gitau was not deterred and last year approached another doctor - this time at a non-governmental organisation that provides family planning services.
She was armed with a bullet-point list of reasons to support her decision and was relieved to find there there was no pushback: ""The doctor was very kind.""
Currently single, she is living happily with her decision, which she feels gives her control over her own life.
The 34-year-old is also happy with the reaction to her video - and relieved that there has been no major backlash.
She says most people online have been cheering her on, which has seen her confidence grow.
""Women can contribute to the world in so many other ways,"" she said.
""It does not have to be through raising a whole human being. I am grateful to live in a generation where choice is a thing.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04zlv32rdqo,Mali to investigate claims soldiers 'executed' women and children,2025-02-22T19:10:03.252Z,"Paul Njie
BBC News","Mali's military government says it is investigating allegations that soldiers ""coldly executed"" at least 24 civilians in the north of the country on Monday.
That claim was made by a separatist Tuareg rebel alliance, called Azawad Liberation Front (FLA), which is battling the Malian government in the same region.
The FLA accuse Malian forces and Russian Wagner mercenaries of intercepting two passenger vehicles travelling to Algeria from the Malian city of Gao and killing the civilians on board, including women and children.
In a statement, army chief Gen Oumar Diarra said the allegations ""relayed by terrorist networks, allies and sponsors"" follow other ""unfounded"" claims against state forces.
For many years, the Malian government has been struggling against both Tuareg rebels seeking a breakaway state in the north and jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.
The military which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021 hired Russian mercenaries from the paramilitary group Wagner to help improve security in the country.
Both government forces and the Russians have often been accused by rights groups of committing gross human rights abuses against civilians, which they deny.
Last month, Mali was one of three countries under military rule to leave the West African regional bloc Ecowas, after refusing its demands to restore civilian rule.
The withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger dealt a huge blow to Ecowas, which at 50 years old is considered Africa's most important regional group.
Mali's military leaders also ended ties with former colonial power France, whose troops left the country in 2022 after more than a decade fighting Islamist insurgents.
The following year, all 12,000 UN peacekeepers left Mali on the junta's instructions.

Jerry Muhindo Kavali, 49, was injured two days ago by a bullet that struck the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) office in Masisi where he was working.
He was taken to hospital in Goma for life-saving treatment but died of his wounds on Saturday.
Colleagues say he was deeply dedicated to humanitarian work and ""always had a smile on his face"".
Kavali's death has angered aid workers trying to help the tens of thousands of Congolese people whose lives have been destroyed by the war.
""Even war has its rules"", said MSF in response to the news.
The town of Masisi, where the MSF worker was shot, has witnessed fierce fighting between militias allied with the Congolese army and rebels belonging to the M23 and Alliance Fleuve Congo rebel groups.
The bullet that killed Kavali was ""one of many bullets to hit our premises over recent weeks"", the MSF head of programmes Stephan Goetghebuer said.
Key areas already under M23 control include provincial capitals Goma and Bukavu, and the rebels appear to be continuing their advance.
Eastern DR Congo is rich in minerals and this battle for control of the region partly has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
It has been riven by conflict for more than 30 years and attempts in recent years to integrate rebels into the Congolese army have failed.
Experts now fear what effects the conflict will have on the wider East Africa region.
On Friday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution condemning the M23 offensive in eastern DR Congo, urging Rwanda to stop supporting the rebels, and saying they should immediately leave Congolese territory ""without preconditions"".
This week, the US announced sanctions on M23 Spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka and Rwandan minister James Kabarebe for his alleged role in the conflict.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d5zqg3228o,How DR Congo's Tutsis become foreigners in their own country,2025-02-22T01:16:14.763Z,"Wedaeli Chibelushi
BBC News","The notorious M23 rebel group is wreaking havoc in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the region's two biggest cities in a deadly uprising which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
Central to their campaign is the assertion that ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo are being persecuted.
Digging into the status of Tutsis in DR Congo - and how it relates to the M23 uprising - is a complex and sensitive matter that goes to the heart of who is considered Congolese.
For starters, many global authorities argue that in their purported fight against discrimination, the rebels have committed unjustifiable atrocities. The UN and US, for instance, have sanctioned M23 leaders over allegations of war crimes, such as sexual violence and the killing of civilians.
Secondly, some regional analysts say that rather than seeking to defend Tutsis, the M23 - and Rwanda, which backs the rebel group - is primarily seeking to exploit the eastern DR Congo's vast mineral wealth.
It is also worth noting that there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in DR Congo - there is no official estimate - and many do not support the actions being carried out in their name.
That being said, experts and organisations like the UN have documented decades of discrimination against Congolese Tutsis and the Banyamulenge - a Tutsi sub-group concentrated in the South Kivu province.
This ranges from ethnic killings, to workplace discrimination, to hate speech on the part of politicians.
At the root of this discrimination is the association of Tutsis with neighbouring Rwanda, which has been led by Tutsis since 1994. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Congolese Tutsis played a key role in violent Rwandan-backed rebellions against the governments then running DR Congo.
The perception that Congolese Tutsis are ""foreign"" can have deadly consequences.
Bukuru Muhizi, a researcher and economist from South Kivu's Mwenga territory, told the BBC that people from various generations of his family had been killed because of their Banyamulenge and Tutsi identities.
He said that in the past six years, his great-uncle and great-uncle's son were killed by Congolese soldiers and local militia fighters. The Congolese armed forces have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on this allegation.
Mr Muhizi said his family has lived in present-day DR Congo for centuries and that he ""wished the world knew"" his community was experiencing what he called a ""silent genocide"".
Muragwa Cheez Bienvenue, a Banyamulenge activist, said he was once targeted by airport staff in the city of Bukavu.
""I was stopped - they told me I look like [Rwandan President] Kagame and they had me pay around $150 (£120) to save myself from being imprisoned,"" he told the BBC, adding that he supports the M23's cause.
Prior to colonisation, part of the territory that is now DR Congo was subject to the Rwandan monarchy, which is Tutsi. It had long been fighting expansionist wars, extending the kingdom to include more and more of East Africa.
Tutsis, Hutus and other ethnic groups lived in the Rwandan kingdom and had done so since at least the 19th Century. But when colonial powers drew up arbitrary borders in Africa, the kingdom was split between present-day DR Congo and Rwanda.
Subsequently, other Tutsis have migrated to DR Congo in waves. In the mid-20th Century, Belgian colonialists brought workers over from present-day Rwanda to staff their plantations, while others came on their own accord in search of a better life.
Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees began arriving in DR Congo, fleeing waves of ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries have long been dominated by their Tutsi minorities, leading to tensions with the Hutu majority.
Many more are thought to have arrived in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered. But when a Tutsi-led government seized power and ended the massacres, some returned, especially after some of those responsible for the genocide then fled into DR Congo.
As DR Congo's Tutsi and Banyamulenge communities grew, the Congolese authorities ""alternately empowered and the undermined"" them, Jason K Stearns, a DR Congo analyst, wrote in his book The War That Doesn't Say Its Name.
In the early 1970s, then-President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to anyone who had originated from Rwanda or Burundi, provided they were present on Congolese territory before 1960.
But in 1981, parliament rowed back on these rights and many Tutsis, Banyamulenge and people from other minority groups were ""derived of their nationality and left stateless"", a UN report noted.
In the 1990s, Tutsis and the Banyamulenge were subject to multiple massacres in DR Congo. For instance, a report by the UN says that the Congolese army aided armed groups in killing nearly 300 Banyamulenge civilians in the city of Baraka in 1996.
It also states that ""many"" Tutsis and Banyamulenge lost their jobs and suffered discrimination and threats.
Today, the constitution considers the Tutsi and Banyamulenge groups to be Congolese and some individuals from these communities occupy senior military and governance positions. In fact, Lt-Gen Pacifique Masunzu, the man leading the fight against the M23 as the commander of a key area in eastern DR Congo, is from the Banyamulenge community.
But there is still significant evidence of discrimination. In 2024, experts working for the UN said that in South Kivu, Banyamulenge are commonly seen as harmful to their neighbouring communities. This discourse incites ""hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence"", the experts said.
There have also been recent reports of Tutsi and Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese army being murdered. According to Human Rights Watch, a mob killed a Banyamulenge military officer in 2023 ""in an apparent case of ethnic hatred"".
Politicians - past and present - have also pushed discriminatory sentiment.
Anti-Tutsi feelings appear to rise during M23 rebellions, say DR Congo experts such as Mr Stearns.
He told the BBC he had seen ""pretty terrifying"" social media posts over the past few weeks - ""a phenomenon of people in other parts of the country expressing doubts over a certain person, often an army officer or police officers... the way he looks, and claiming that certain people look like they're Rwandan"".
Although some Congolese Tutsis may back the M23's current uprising, Mr Stearns says ""many of them feel uncomfortable with the consequences this will have for them as a community, because once again, this means that they will be portrayed as treasonous rebels"".
The Congolese government has gone some way in acknowledging the discrimination against Tutsis. For instance, earlier this year President Félix Tshisekedi said he had ""had enough"" of anti-Banyamulenge speech and alleged that such comments gave Rwanda the pretext to invade DR Congo.
However, the authorities have also played down allegations of widespread persecution. Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told the BBC: ""We have 450 tribes and there is conflict between some of them in many parts of the country... The government position is against any kind of discrimination or hate speech against every community"".
Mr Bienvenue on the other hand told the BBC he ""strongly"" believed his ethnic group was discriminated against, giving the example that his sister was once sacked after being told she ""looked like a Rwandan spy"".
This is despite his family living in the same area for centuries.
""The Banyamulenge have been here since Congo was Congo!"" he said, exasperated.

BBC News, Johannesburg","South Africa is set to host Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on a state visit, President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed on X without giving a specific date.
The invite comes at the end of a week which saw Kyiv excluded from US-Russia talks on how to bring an end to the three-year war in Ukraine.
In a phone conversation, Ramaphosa and Zelensky ""agreed on the urgent need for an inclusive peace process"", according to a statement from the South African president. A sentiment Zelensky echoed by saying ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine"".
South Africa, which has in the past been accused of having a closer relationship with Moscow, has tried to play a role in finding an end to the fighting.
In 2023, Ramaphosa led a delegation consisting of seven African countries, including Egypt, Senegal, Zambia, and Uganda, and met Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
South Africa has historic ties with Russia, and both countries form part of the influential Brics bloc - an alliance of major economies that also includes Brazil, India and China.
Ramaphosa, in a post shared on his X page, said: ""I welcome the constructive engagement I had with President [Zelensky] and I look forward to hosting him in South Africa soon for a state visit.""
Zelensky, on his part, said he had thanked Ramaphosa for ""South Africa's support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" in their conversation. ""We all hope to achieve a just and lasting peace this year,"" he added.
Ramaphosa and Zelensky have had regular conversations since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - and have met in person - but despite Zelensky's interest in a state visit to South Africa, there has been no movement to make this happen until now.
The Ukrainian leader back in December expressed his interest in coming to South Africa during an engagement with African journalists at the International Food Summit, according to South African online publication News24.
""I will be in Pretoria with pleasure, but you must ask Mr Ramaphosa because I think he is more busy,"" he told the publication.
Dr Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, hailed the planned state visit as a ""brilliant"" move by South Africa – because it not only allows Kyiv a platform to express its concerns amid the US-Russia talks but sends ""a number of messages globally"".
""Ramaphosa is being clever because [US President Donald] Trump might want to dismiss South Africa as a... small African country but we are yet again able to demonstrate that we can operate above our station internationally.""
He added that Zelensky may be appealing to South Africa due to the country's relationship with Russia and its role as an ""honest broker"" with no vested interest in the war.
Zelensky's continued engagement with world leaders comes amid its increasingly tense relationship with the US, which it considers a key ally.
The tension took a turn for the worse this week when Trump accused Zelensky of being a a ""dictator"" who has ""done a terrible job"".
South Africa's invite also comes at a time of increasingly strained relations with the US. The Trump administration recently cut off aid to the country over a new land expropriation law.
Ramaphosa has said that his country ""will not be bullied"".

BBC News, Abuja","Nigeria's ex-military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida has expressed deep regret for the first time for annulling the results of the 1993 presidential election.
The poll was supposed to bring about an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. The date of the vote – 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.
Gen Babangida was forced to resign. Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.
Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.
The former military leader, 83, expressed his regret at the launch of his autobiography A Journey in Service in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday.
""Undoubtedly credible, free and fair elections were held on 12 June 1993,"" he told the audience made up of the cream of Nigerian society, including Tinubu, two former presidents – Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan - and two other ex-military leaders, Abdulsalam Abubakar and Yakubu Gowon.
""However, the tragic irony of history remains that the administration that devised a near-perfect electoral system and conducted those near-perfect elections could not complete the process.
""That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret.""
Gen Babangida, popularly known as IBB, also acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, won the election.
However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.
For three decades, the circumstances surrounding the 1993 election have been shrouded in controversy, with conflicting accounts emerging overtime.
This new admission, seen as reopening old wounds, has triggered fresh debates rather than closure.
Many people will be expecting the former military ruler to also provide answers to some questions relating to his policies at the time.
Gen Babangida, who overthrew another military leader Muhammadu Buhari in 1985, led the county for eight years.
Multiparty democracy did eventually return to Nigeria in 1999 with the election of Obasanjo – who had also been a former military leader – as president.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4vdkmpg04o,Veteran Ugandan politician charged with treason,2025-02-21T11:46:40.406Z,"Swaibu Ibrahim
BBC News, Kampala","Veteran Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye has been charged with treason in a civilian court after his controversial case was transferred from a military tribunal.
Treason is a capital offence in Uganda and if found guilty the 68-year-old cold be sentenced to death.
He was charged alongside two other suspects, but they did not enter a plea on the grounds that the charges against them could only be heard in a higher court.
Besigye, who has run for president against long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni four times, has been in detention since he was dramatically abducted in Kenya in November and taken back to Uganda to face a military trial.
But a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court last month said that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional and ordering all such cases to be transferred.
The move angered President Museveni, who called it ""a wrong decision"".
At the start of last week, Besigye had begun a hunger strike over his continued detention.
The charges stem from accusations that he was plotting to remove Museveni from power by force.
Friday was the first first time Besigye had appeared before a civilian court for formal charges, after the Supreme Court ruling.
Visibly frail, he was wheeled before the Nakawa magistrate court in the capital, Kampala, alongside his aide and co-accused Obeid Lutale.
The opposition politician has now called-off his hunger strike, his lawyer Erias Lukwago told journalists.
According to the charge sheet presented before court, Besigye is accused of holding meetings in Switzerland, Greece and Kenya between 2023 and November last year in a plot to overturn the government.
He was also accused of soliciting for military, financial and other logistical support to topple Museveni's government.
Besigye was charged alongside Mr Lutale and Denis Oola, a military officer.
Previous charges heard in the military court of illegal possession of ammunition and treachery were not included in the new charge sheet.
During proceedings, Besigye's lawyer asked the court to order that he be transferred to a better health facility outside the prison but Magistrate Esther Nyadoi dismissed the application, saying she was unable to grant such a request.
She ordered the accused to be remanded until next month to allow the prosecutor to finish the investigation.
Besigye used to be a personal doctor for Museveni, who has been in power since 1986.
The veteran opposition figure has previously accused the Ugandan authorities of political persecution.
He has been less active in politics in recent years, and did not contest the 2021 election.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0dg11y6xko,Rwanda angered by US sanctions over DR Congo violence,2025-02-21T10:00:59.540Z,"Wycliffe Muia
BBC News","The Rwandan government has condemned the US decision to sanction a government minister for his alleged role in the conflict in the east of neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.
Announcing the financial sanctions on Thursday, the US Treasury Department said Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration James Kabarebe, a former army chief, was central to his country's support for the M23 rebel group.
Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controls in Britain and France, the US Treasury said.
On Friday, the UK said there would be ""consequences"" for Rwanda over its alleged role in DR Congo.
Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions would not resolve the conflict in the DR Congo, terming them ""unjustified and unfounded"".
They come as the M23 appears to be continuing its advance after capturing two major cities in recent weeks in the mineral-rich east of DR Congo.
The rebel group, mainly comprised of ethnic Tutsis, has seized the cities of Goma and Bukavu - sparking a major humanitarian crisis that left families devastated.
Western powers have accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 with arms and as well as backing from the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF), accusations Rwanda denies.
The US Treasury Department on Thursday said Kabarebe was sanctioned because ""he is central to Rwanda's support"" for the M23 armed group.
It said Kabarebe together with Kanyuka were ""linked to violence and human rights abuses"" in DR Congo.
""Today's action underscores our intent to hold accountable key officials and leaders like Kabarebe and Kanyuka, who are enabling the RDF and M23's destabilising activities in the eastern DRC,"" said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.
""The United States remains committed to ensuring a peaceful resolution to this conflict.""
But Rwanda dismissed the US action, saying Kigali's aim was only to secure its border and an ""irreversible end to the politics of armed ethnic extremism in our region"".
""Rwandans have the right to live in peace and without the perpetual threat of insecurity originating from the DRC,"" the ministry statement stated.
""Punitive measures, including sanctions, make no contribution toward long-term security, peace and stability for all the countries of the Great Lakes region,"" it added.
DR Congo welcomed the US sanctions, saying it wanted to see more such measures.
""This marks the beginning of a long series of sanctions that we want to be more robust from the UN Security Council, the European Union and other partners in order to force Rwanda to withdraw its troops and cease its criminal activities on our soil,"" government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said in a statement posted on social media.
Addressing G20 foreign ministers in South Africa on Friday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy termed the reported involvement of Rwandan troops a ""blatant breach of the UN Charter which risks spiralling into a regional conflict"".
Speaking at the venue Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira condemned the recent attacks on the UN forces and regional peacekeepers in DR Congo.
For its part, China maintained that it ""firmly supports the African people in independently resolving African problems and opposes external interference in the internal affairs of African countries"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2erkxpevxvo,Trailblazing African film-maker and Cannes winner dies,2025-02-20T09:21:05.133Z,"Basillioh Rukanga
BBC News","Malian film director Souleymane Cissé, one of the pioneers of African cinema, has died aged 84.
His daughter, Mariam Cissé, confirmed his death at a clinic in the capital Bamako, expressing shock and mourning ""the loss of a man who dedicated his life to film and art"".
The cause of his death has not been announced.
Cissé gained international recognition in 1987 when his film Yeelen (The Light) won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the first film-maker from sub-Saharan Africa to win an award at the prestigious festival.
His trailblazing career spanned more than 50 years, winning many accolades along the way.
In 2023, Cissé was honoured by Cannes with a Carrosse d'Or award, usually given to directors who have ""marked the history of cinema with their boldness, their exacting standards and their intransigence in staging"".
Cissé was also a double winner of the grand prize at the biennial Pan-African Film Festival, Fespaco.
At the time of his death he had been due to travel to Burkina Faso to preside over the jury at the festival, which opens on Saturday.
Tributes have been pouring in for Cissé for his dedication to African storytelling.
Mali's Culture Minister Mamou Daffé lamented the loss ""of this monument of African cinema"", while fellow Malian director Boubacar Sidibé said the country's film industry was in ""mourning"".
Film lovers have praised Cissé's works for their complexity, political engagement and deep humanity.
His first feature film, Den Muso (The Young Girl) shot in 1975, was in the local Bambara language, and is considered an African classic.
The film is about a young girl who is raped, becomes pregnant and is rejected by her family.
The film was banned by the Malian authorities, and Cissé was jailed for having accepted French funding. He wrote the screenplay for his second film, Baara (Work), while in prison.
He made other films including Finyè (The Wind) in 1981, and Yeelen (The Light), which won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 1987. His last film in 1995 was Waati (Time).
Cissé was born in Bamako, and spent part of his childhood in neighbouring Senegal.
Later, he studied film in Russia's capital Moscow, becoming one of the first generation of African film-makers.
Cissé went on to champion government support for and investment in the film industry.
He was the founding president of the union representing West Africa's entrepreneurs in cinema and audiovisual arts.
Cissé was often outspoken about other barriers to the spread of African cinema - criticising ""censorship"" and ""contempt"", and urging young film-makers not to act like ""beggars who must plead every time for financing from Europe"" but instead seek greater independence.
Hours before his death, he reportedly urged Mali's military government to help the country's industry catch up with its continental rivals.
""It is not enough to make cinema, the works must also be visible,"" the AFP news agency quoted Cissé as saying.
""May the authorities help us with the construction of cinemas.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czepewl780eo,'Robbers stole the crosses from my daughter's and my mother's graves for scrap',2025-02-20T01:28:35.942Z,"Alfred Lasteck
BBC News, Morogoro","Grave after grave after grave in this cemetery in the eastern Tanzanian city of Morogoro has been vandalised.
In some, there is a gap where a metal crucifix once stood, in others the religious symbol is bent as thieves, who were hoping sell it to scrap merchants, tried and failed to remove it.
More than 250 have been targeted in one small section of the Kola Municipal Cemetery alone.
The crimes mostly happen at night when there is no security and there are no cemetery workers around.
They have left families devastated and the sites desecrated, sparking anger.
For more than two decades, Pudensiana Chumbi has been going to the cemetery about once a month to visit the graves of her daughter and mother - and to her distress both have been desecrated over the last few years, multiple times.
The first to be targeted was the grave of her mother who died in 2000.
A few months after the family had managed to save up to replace the stolen cross in late 2021, her daughter's grave was damaged. It was nearby and a little older - her daughter had died in 1997 aged 15.
Before Ms Chumbi could make a decision about fixing her daughter's cross, to her horror the new cross on her mother's grave was stolen.
In a quandary about what to do next, she felt metal was not an option when it came to replacing her daughter's cross.
""This is my child's grave - my fourth child,"" she said pointing towards the concrete cross.
The theft of crosses and markers from graves has become a disturbing trend in this part of Tanzania, driven by the rising demand for scrap metal.
""The people doing this are cursed because everyone is sad about what is going on,"" Ms Chumbi tells the BBC.
""There are some young men who now demand payment to guard graves overnight, especially those with tiles.""
Tiles can also be sold on for people to use as decorations in their home.
Augustine Remmy, Ms Chumbi's brother, says it is upsetting for the whole community.
""This is too bad… when these areas that deserve respect are subjected to such bad acts, it truly hurts a lot,"" he tells the BBC.
The rash of thefts reflects a desperation among some to make some money that overrides ethical concerns about damaging sacred sites.
The criminals can earn between 700 and 870 Tanzanian shillings ($0.27-$0.34; £0.22-£0.28) per kilogramme.
It is not a huge amount of money but it can be enough to pay for a plate of food from a vendor or some locally brewed alcohol.
""Metal dealers often buy without asking questions,"" says one man who admitted to the BBC that he had stolen crosses from a cemetery to sell on the scrap metal market.
Agreeing to speak on condition of anonymity, he describes how the thieves would first go to welders who cut the crosses into pieces before taking them to the scrap merchants.
The merchants are faced with the choice of buying cheaper stolen goods or abiding by the law.
Izire Ramadhani, a dealer in Morogoro city centre, recalls how in 2023 he, along with some other scrap merchants, caught someone trying to sell a stolen cross and reported him to the authorities.
""In the past, they used to bring us crosses. But then we took one of them to the police, and later he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison,"" Mr Ramadhani tells the BBC.
He says this led to a reduction in the theft of crosses, although there has been a recent increase.
Mr Ramadhani insists that he does not buy stolen goods.
""If a cross is brought here, the person coming to sell to us will be in trouble because we will take him to the police.""
Thieves have also begun targeting other grave markers like tiles and marble decorations, which can easily be sold on to other buyers.
Dr Ndimile Kilatu, Morogoro's health officer, said the city's authorities planned to improve cemetery security by introducing fences and guards but warned that ""this requires resources and time.
""It is not something that we can do today or tomorrow.""
He also mentioned initiatives to educate scrap metal dealers about the materials that should not be bought, such as grave markers and railway components.
Tanzania's government has also pledged to regulate the scrap metal industry.
Deputy Prime Minister Dotto Biteko has emphasised the need for licensed businesses to adhere to the laws and regulations.
""What is required is just to enforce that and keep the population educated on the same subject. We will keep so educating our people so that we put our infrastructure safe,"" he told the BBC.
Religious leaders are also appealing to their communities to do more to prevent those involved in these crimes from carrying them out.
Pastor Steven Msigara from the Jesus Assembles of God in Morogoro has called for a united effort to educate young people on the need to respect sacred places.
""Together, we must restore their dignity, we know some youth are exposed to bad acts but we can return them to the right track,"" he says.
For relatives of those whose graves have been desecrated, there is a feeling of frustration.
Ms Chumbi wants more money to be spent on security at the cemeteries as well as a commitment to look after the sites with care befitting a place where loved ones are laid to rest.
She is in the process of replacing her mother's cross for a second time - and, as in her daughter's case - is opting for concrete.

BBC Africa health correspondent","Uganda has discharged eight patients who have recovered from the Sudan strain of Ebola after they tested negative twice, health officials have said.
The disease has killed one person and infected eight others since an outbreak was reported last month, but 265 people, who were listed for monitoring, remain in quarantine.
This is the eighth Ebola outbreak in Uganda since the first infection was recorded in 2000.
The Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (SUDV) is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues. It is one of several strains of the Ebola virus known to cause outbreaks.
Unlike the more common Zaire Ebola virus, there is no approved vaccine for the Sudan strain.
However, the government launched a trial vaccine earlier this month.
Only a 32-year-old male nurse is known to have died in the latest outbreak.
Uganda's Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero confirmed the discharge of the eight patients, and said they should not be stigmatised.
""I urge their families and communities to receive and interact with them normally,"" the minister added.
The UN World Health Organization (WHO) said their recovery was ""an important milestone"" in efforts to contain the outbreak.
The Sudan strain is severe, normally killing at least 40% of those infected, but the fatality rate this time is low, the WHO said.

Trump's special envoy, Richard Grenell, had initially brokered a deal with Venezuela's government to take back its citizens deported from the US.
""Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the US, including gang members of Tren de Aragua,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time. ""Venezuela has further agreed to supply the transportation back.""
But Maduro halted deportation flights from the US on 8 March, after the US Treasury Department suspended the energy giant Chevron's permission to export oil from Venezuela, the AP reported.
On 15 March, the Trump administration deported 238 Venezuelans, who they alleged belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, to El Salvador, where they were detained at a mega-prison.
The administration has not named the individuals deported, or provided details of their alleged criminal behaviour
In a statement issued on Saturday, Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela's national assembly, appeared to address the matter of the Venezuelan nationals currently held in El Salvador.
He said Venezuela accepted a deal to assure ""the return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their Human Rights,"" the AP reported.
""Migrating isn't a crime, and we won't rest until everyone who wants to return is back and we rescue our kidnapped brothers in El Salvador.""
Trump has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as a legal basis for removing 137 of those Venezuelan deportees, which immediately prompted a legal challenge.
A federal judge in Washington, DC sought to block the deportation flights to El Salvador via a verbal order.
However, the planes landed in El Salvador, and the country's president Nayib Bukele posted on social media that the intervention came ""too late"".
The White House has faced allegations of defying the judge's order, which it refutes.

BBC News","An Italian fugitive accused of having coordinated the shipment of large cocaine cargoes from Latin America to Europe has been arrested in Colombia.
Colombia's national police chief described Emanuele Gregorini, who is also known as ""Dollarino"", as ""the head of the Italian mafia Latin America"".
He said Gregorini had been tracked down to an apartment in the seaside city of Cartagena in a multinational operation which included Italian, British and Colombian investigators.
He had been on the run since 2023, when prosecutors accused him of being a key figure in the ""Lombardy mafia system"", which they described as an alliance between the Camorra, Cosa Nostra, and 'Ndrangheta mafia groups.
Police accuse Gregorini of having a key role in organising cocaine shipments from the Colombian port cities of Cartagena, Barranquilla and Santa Marta to Europe.
Colombian Police Chief Carlos Triana said Gregorini's arrest was ""a severe blow"" to transnational crime syndicates.
He also described him as an ""invisible narco"", who did not draw attention to himself.
Surveillance footage published by the Colombian authorities showed him going to the gym and visiting local restaurants in the upscale neighbourhood where he had rented an apartment, apparently without fear of being recognised.
Prosecutors say his arrest in Colombia points to an increased presence of the Italian mafia in Latin America.
According to Insight Crime, a think tank specialising in organised crime, European criminal networks have been establishing their own drug smuggling routes in South America rather than relying on middlemen.
Italian mafia groups in particular have expanded their presence in Colombia and Brazil in recent years, the think tank says.
In October, Luigi Belvedere, one of Italy's most wanted men, was detained in the city of Medellín, where he had posed beside the grave of the late Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar.",Latin America

South America correspondent, Quito","Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his ""war"" against criminal gangs.
He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels.
He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater.
Violence has soared in Ecuador in recent years, with gangs battling to control drug trafficking routes. Most of the world's cocaine is trafficked through Ecuador's ports.
President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels – but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil and Europe.
Security – and how he is dealing with it – is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April.
Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons – however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed.
During his term, the murder rate decreased by approximately 16% from 2023 to 2024 but it remains far higher than previous years, and in January 2025 killings hit a record 781 in one month.
In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: ""We need to have more soldiers to fight this war.""
""Seventy per cent of the world's cocaine exits via Ecuador. We need the help of international forces.""
He said what started as ""criminal gangs"" are now ""international narco-terrorist"" groups of 14,000 armed individuals.
Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them.
Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: ""I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are.""
Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with ""allied nations"" to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again.
As well as constitutional changes, it would require other nations to be willing to offer this. Deploying armies abroad can be risky and expensive but there is some precedent for it. The US had a military base for its anti-narcotic operations in Ecuador until 2009, before these were banned by former President Rafael Correa.
President Noboa's challenge will be convincing figures like Donald Trump in the US, or leaders in Europe where many drugs are shipped to, that it is in their interests too to stop cartels and drug trafficking.
On the alliance with Trump ally Erik Prince, which he announced a few days ago, he said: ""We're fighting an unconventional, urban guerilla war. He has the experience. He's advising our armed forces, our police.""
Mr Prince founded the private military firm Blackwater that has provided security services to US governments but has also been embroiled in controversy. He sold the company in 2010.
Four Blackwater contractors were convicted and jailed for killing 14 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007 and were later pardoned by Trump in 2020.
Does President Noboa want Mr Prince to bring mercenaries to the country?
""Not necessarily mercenaries,"" he said. ""We are talking about armies. US, European, Brazilian special forces. This could be a great help for us.""
While some supported the move, some Ecuadoreans cited Mr Prince's past record and feared rights abuses in the country.
When asked about some of Erik Prince's past controversies, Mr Noboa said Ecuador's laws must be respected and warfare conducted legally.
But, he added, cartels had ""violated every single human right possible for the last five years"".
""They've mutilated people. They've raped thousands of women. They've trafficked human organs. They've traded illegal gold. And moved more than 1,000 tonnes of cocaine a year.""
Last year, his iron-fist approach came under fire after four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft and later found mutilated and burned.
Noboa said those soldiers were in jail pending an investigation but that he would ""fight until the end"" to convict those responsible.
He maintained the armed forces were acting proportionately in tackling crime and noted an imbalance between his 35,000-strong military and 40,000 armed gang members.
With the record number of killings in January, leading critics argue his strict approach is failing.
During a campaign rally, his left-wing challenger Luisa González said: ""The campaign promises made in 2023 were to be delivered in a year and a half. Not two. Not three. Did he deliver? No!""
Noboa said it was normal to see rising violence before elections in his country, but reiterated that Ecuador could not fight this problem alone: ""This is a transnational crime without a transnational security policy.""
While Albanian, Mexican and Colombian cartels worked together, there was not a joint security policy among countries affected by drug violence, he said.
Ecuador needs help, he argued, because its economy is smaller than many in Europe or the US where most drugs are shipped to.
He added drug trafficking and illegal mining generated $30bn (£23bn) – around 27% of GDP – annually in Ecuador.
He urged countries where consumption of cocaine is high, like the UK, to do more to tackle this arguing: ""The product they're consuming has a chain of violence and misery.""
Violence and post-pandemic unemployment have driven many Ecuadoreans to flee northward.
They are now one of the top nationalities crossing the dangerous Darien Gap jungle from South to North America.
President Noboa is willing to take back Ecuadorean migrants from the US, but not other nationalities, and said the country was giving returnees technical training and a minimum wage for three months.
For him, the solution is improving ""opportunities"".
""We need to develop, as an export-based economy, jobs in Ecuador for these people.""
While he said he ""100%"" empathised with people fleeing violence, he blamed a past ""lack of strong security policy"".
His message to Ecuadoreans now? ""Stay - and you'll see positive results. We're reducing inflation. Companies are hiring. The economy is recovering.""
Daniel Noboa will face Luisa González in the run-off vote next month.
He received only 0.5% more votes than her in the first round, suggesting the second round could be very close and polarising.
With security the top issue for voters, his success – or not – may depend on whether Ecuadoreans think progress has been good enough.",Latin America

BBC News, Los Angeles","US President Donald Trump's administration has said it will revoke the temporary legal status of more than half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Those migrants have been warned to leave the country before their permits and deportation shield are cancelled on 24 April, according to a notice posted by the federal government.
The 530,000 migrants were brought into the US under a Biden-era sponsorship process known as CHNV that was designed to open legal migration pathways. Trump suspended the programme once he took office.
It is unclear how many of these migrants have been able to secure another status in the interim that would allow them to stay in the US legally.
The programme was launched under Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022, first covering Venezuelans before it was expanded to other countries.
It allowed the migrants and their immediate family members to fly into the US if they had American sponsors and remain for two years under a temporary immigration status known as parole.
The Biden administration had argued that CHNV would help curb illegal crossings at the southern US border and allow for better vetting of those entering the country.
The Department of Homeland Security on Friday rebuked the prior administration and said the programme had failed in its goals.
The agency's statement said Biden officials had ""granted them [migrants] opportunities to compete for American jobs and undercut American workers; forced career civil servants to promote the programs even when fraud was identified; and then blamed Republicans in Congress for the chaos that ensued and the crime that followed"".
However, the 35-page notice in the Federal Register said some of those in the US under CHNV might be allowed to remain on a ""case-by-case basis"".
Karen Tumlin, founder of the Justice Action Center in California, said her organisation is set to challenge the move in court.
She told the BBC the decision hurt people ""who did everything right that the US Government asked of them"", adding that ""their sponsors in the United States paid the fees, filled out the government paperwork, waited in line"".
""To say 'oh, we're so sorry, even if you had 18 months left on your grant of permission to be here we're going to pull the rug out from under you in the next 30 days,' it's really quite surprising.""
Trump is also considering whether to cancel the temporary legal status of some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia.
CHNV helped a reported 213,000 Haitians enter the US amid deteriorating conditions in the Caribbean country.
More than 120,700 Venezuelans, 110,900 Cubans and over 93,000 Nicaraguans were also allowed into the US under the programme before Trump shut it down.
Last month, DHS announced it would in August end another immigration designation, temporary protected status (TPS), for 500,000 Haitians living in the US.
TPS was granted to nationals of designated countries facing unsafe conditions, such as armed conflict or environmental disasters.
DHS also halted TPS for Venezuelans in the US, although this is facing a legal challenge.

BBC News","Following two days of sometimes violent protests, Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo has withdrawn a decree which would have made car insurance compulsory in the Central American nation.
Under the new law, owners of cars, lorries, buses and motorbikes would have been required to take out insurance to cover harm caused to others in the event of an accident.
President Arévalo argued that the new rule was necessary to compensate victims of traffic accidents, but many in Guatemala - where an estimated 55% live in poverty - said they would not be able to afford the extra cost.
Thousands blocked major roads and clashed with police in the days since the decree was made public on Monday.
The government had issued the decree in the wake of a deadly bus accident last month in which more than 50 people died.
Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, the president said he had been elected to bring about necessary changes in the country, some of which could be difficult.
""I remain convinced that a new general transport law is the right way forward for the wellbeing of our country,"" he said, adding that traffic accidents were the main cause of death in Guatemala.
He said that after talks with representatives of the protesters, the two sides had agreed to set up a technical committee to come up with a plan on how to introduce compulsory insurance within a year.
One of the concerns which had been voiced by the protesters was that the decree had been published without giving motorists an idea of the costs they would have incurred once it came into force on 1 May.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crewlj11jljo,Oil giant's leaked data reveals 'awful' pollution,2025-03-20T01:13:28.415Z,"Owen Pinnell
BBC Eye Investigations","Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.
Data leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.
The BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.
Ecopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.
The company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.
The huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena – a water source for millions of people.
Members of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.
The wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.
When the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.
One local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.
In places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.
A fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.
Pointing to it, Yuly Velásquez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: ""This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.""
Ecopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.
In response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.
Andrés Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.
He joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised ""something was wrong"".
Mr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as ""awful"" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: ""Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.""
He left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.
One database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called ""unresolved environmental impacts"" across Colombia.
Ecopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.
Mr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled ""only known to Ecopetrol"".
""You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,"" says Mr Olarte.
The BBC filmed at one of the sites marked ""only known to Ecopetrol"", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.
Ecopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bayón, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.
""I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',"" he said.
Mr Bayón blamed sabotage for many oil spills.
Colombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but ""theft"" or ""attack"" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.
He also said he believed there had been a ""significant advance"" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.
However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.
Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.
Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as ""unresolved"".
The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.
It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.
The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Velásquez and the fishers live.
The fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.
She said there had been a ""massacre"" of fauna. ""This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,"" she said last June.
It is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Niño weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.
A 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.
Mr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.
""In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,"" he says.
Mr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.
Ms Velásquez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.
She said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word ""leave"" on the wall.
The fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.
Asked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bayón said they were ""absolutely unacceptable"".
""I want to make it totally clear… that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,"" Mr Bayón said.
Ms Velásquez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.
Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.
Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.
Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.
But he says there is an ""immense"" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.
Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.
Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.
""There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,"" Mr Smith says.
He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to ""ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly"".
Mr Bayón said he was ""convinced that the checks and due diligence were done"" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.
Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.
The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.
Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.
He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.
""I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,"" he says.
Mr Bayón stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.
""We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,"" he said. ""I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.""
And Ms Velásquez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.
""If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,"" she said. ""If we speak and report, we are killed… And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.""",Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ez63ndvo,What makes a rum Jamaican? Question at heart of Caribbean legal dispute,2025-03-24T00:05:50.409Z,"Jacob Evans
Business reporter•@__jacobevans","Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?
That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called ""Jamaica rum"".
In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.
The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.
The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets – the EU and the US.
It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.
But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.
This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders – the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).
The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.
It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.
And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.
The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.
""What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,"" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.
Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.
Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that ""we were a little bit puzzled"" by the NRJ's objection.
The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.
Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.
The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.
""The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.""
This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.
The second reason is ""they anchor production in that region"". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.
Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and ""opens up other aspects of history and geography"", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.
Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.
Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.
Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.
Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.
The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. ""We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,"" he says.
Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.
Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. ""It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,"" he says.
And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.
In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms ""with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand"".
It concluded: ""When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.""",Latin America

BBC News","On Saturday, the US government put hundreds of Venezuelans on planes which swiftly took off for the alleged gang members' ultimate destination: a mega-prison in El Salvador.
A judge then ordered the planes back, telling the government's lawyers verbally that they should do so ""however that's accomplished — whether turning around the plane or not.""
But the court order was never heeded, and the planes stayed the course.
""Oopsie…too late,"" El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, posted on X after the deportees landed in his country. He included an emoji crying with laughter. The post was reshared by the White House's director of communications, Steven Cheung.
Little information has been provided about the identities of those detained, but the Trump administration alleges that many of the deportees were members of Tren de Aragua, a notorious transnational criminal gang.
Lawyers for some of the deportees refute that claim, and human rights groups have raised concerns about the lack of due process.
This incident has ignited fears that the White House is willing to openly defy a federal court order, setting it on a potential collision course with America's judicial branch.
In America's system of government checks and balances, federal courts in the judicial branch have the responsibility of reviewing actions by the president and the government agencies in the executive branch tasked with enacting laws passed by Congress. An order issued by a judge is binding - and noncompliance can result in civil and criminal sanctions.
It very rarely gets that far, however, as involved parties traditionally defer to a judge's ruling.
White House officials said they did not purposefully ignore a court ruling. They argued, in part, that because Judge James Boasberg's order was made orally rather than in written form, it was not enforceable - and that the planes had already left the US by the time it was issued.
But a timeline of events reported by US media suggests the Trump administration had the opportunity to stop at least some of the deportations.
Legal scholars have kept a close eye on the White House's reaction to judges across the country who have paused or blocked its actions, including the mass firings of federal employees and broad freezing of federal funds. Several of Donald Trump's early moves in his second term indicate a willingness to test the limits of presidential power, and constitutional scholars have watched for signs the president will openly defy the nation's courts.
""The Trump administration is pushing the bounds of executive authority, especially on immigration issues,"" said Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School.
""When the executive branch wilfully disregards clear and specific court orders, as the administration did with the [Venezuelan] deportation flights, the checks-and-balances system established by the U.S. Constitution is at risk, and our constitutional democracy is threatened,"" she said.
The federal judge involved in Saturday's ruling – Judge Boasberg – made his order after five Venezuelans in federal custody filed a lawsuit challenging their removal under an 18th century law that has not been used since World War Two. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 allows the president sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an ""enemy"" nation without following the usual processes.
According to US officials, more than 130 of those on the Venezuelan deportation flights were also expelled under that law, a move seemingly crafted to move quickly and evade immediate judicial review.
Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrant's Rights Project, told the BBC this weekend that he believed the Trump administration had improperly invoked the 1798 act.
""The other dangerous part of this is that the government is saying the federal courts have no role in this, that the federal courts in the United States can't review what President Trump has done,"" he added. ""That's a very, very dangerous argument.""
At a Monday hearing, Judge Boasberg demanded answers about the timing of the flights in relation to his order that the planes return to the US. Trump administration officials asserted that they respected court orders and followed the law, arguing that ""an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction"". The judge ordered further details about the flights by noon Tuesday and another hearing Friday.
There is also growing frustration within the White House, and among conservatives in general, over what they view as lower-level judges overstepping their authority in delaying or suspending the implementation of the president's executive orders. A ruling by a federal judge in one state can put an immediate hold on a policy being implemented across the country.
""It's a judge that's putting himself in the position of the president of the United States, who was elected by close to 80 million votes,"" Trump said on Sunday in response to a federal judge's order to suspend his firing of thousands of federal workers. ""That's a very dangerous thing for our country. And I would suspect that we're going to have to get a decision from the Supreme Court.""
The nine-member US Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, including three justices appointed by Trump in his first term, could be poised as the ultimate arbiter of this growing number of legal battles.
Last week, the Trump administration asked the high court to step in and overturn a lower court's suspension of an order revoking automatic citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants born on US soil. That request is still pending.
Trump's efforts to downsize the federal workforce, shutter federal agencies, suspend refugee admissions and asylum claims, and freeze government loans and grants are all working their way through the US court system at varying speed. Each has its own distinct legal issues, but all also involve the ability of judges to delay, and scrutinise, presidential action.
With the Venezuelan deportees already in El Salvador, Judge Boasberg may have limited ability to address their fate - but he could attempt to sanction Trump administration officials if he determines they defied his order.
That may be a legal fight Trump is happy to wage, confident that the political benefit of being seen removing what he argues are dangerous criminal gang members will outweigh any legal setbacks along the way.
""A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil"", White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday in response to the furore.
Previous presidents, both Democratic and Republican, have frequently complained of being hampered by low-level judges that issue sweeping rulings undermining their policy-making efforts. Some have questioned their authority to do so. In the months ahead, Trump may be the one who pushes this conflict to a more definitive resolution.",Latin America

BBC News, Washington","In September 2023, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro sent 11,000 soldiers to storm the Tocorón Prison in the northern state of Aragua. But they were not dispatched to quell a riot.
The troops were taking back control of the jail from a powerful gang that had turned it into something of a resort, complete with zoo, restaurants, nightclub, betting shop and swimming pool.
But the gang's boss, Hector Guerrero Flores, escaped.
Now the Tren de Aragua organisation is in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's drive to remove foreign criminals from the US as part of his pledge to deliver mass deportations of illegal immigrants.
Here is what we do know about Tren de Aragua.
Tren de Aragua was originally a prison gang that Hector Guerrero Flores turned into a ""transnational criminal organisation"", according the US state department, which is offering a reward of $5m for information that could lead to his arrest.
Guerrero Flores, 41, was in and out of Tocorón for more than a decade.
He escaped in 2012 by bribing a guard and was then rearrested in 2013. Upon his return, he transformed the prison into a leisure complex.
And he expanded the gang's influence far beyond the jail's gates, seizing control of gold mines in Bolivar state, drug corridors on the Caribbean coast, and clandestine border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, according to the US state department.
The gang's name translates as ""Train of Aragua"", and it may have come from a railroad workers' union. Aragua, on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, is one of the country's 23 states.
Luis Izquiel, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, told the BBC that the union controlled a section of the railway that crossed Aragua and would extort contractors and sell jobs on work sites.
Tren de Aragua has under Guerrero Flores's leadership expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and diversified from extorting migrants into sex-trafficking, contract killing and kidnapping.
By most accounts, Tren de Aragua spread out of Venezuela when the country entered a humanitarian and economic emergency in 2014 that made crime less profitable, and now is believed to have nodes in eight other countries, including the US.
The group, in part, operates by forming alliances and partnerships with local criminal organisations.
In Ecuador, for example, the gang is believed to work with groups loosely affiliated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, while in Colombia some have alleged that they have worked with members of the left-wing National Liberation Army guerrilla group, or ELN.
Ronna Rísquez, a journalist who has written the definitive book on the group, estimated last year that the organisation has 5,000 members and annual profits of between $10m and $15m.
Others have estimated its membership at roughly half that figure.
A prosecutor in Chile has called Tren de Aragua a ""brutal organisation"" that uses murder and torture to achieve its aims.
While it is smaller or less wealthy than other criminal groups in Latin America, Tren de Aragua is often compared to the ultra-violent MS-13 gang from El Salvador.
Tren de Aragua members have been accused of dressing up as Chilean police officers and then kidnapping Venezuelan opposition military officer Ronald Ojeda, whose body was found buried in Santiago, Chile, in March 2024.
The US Treasury, under then-President Joe Biden, sanctioned Tren de Aragua last summer, saying that the gang was involved in sex-trafficking across the US border.
On Saturday, Trump invoked the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act as he accused Tren de Aragua of ""perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States"".
He said the gang was engaged in ""irregular warfare"" against the US at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Shortly after taking office in January, Trump also declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation, placing the group in the same category as the Islamic State and Boko Haram, Nigeria's Islamist militants.
In Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois, alleged Tren de Aragua members have been arrested in recent months and charged with crimes ranging from murder to kidnapping.
In one notable example, two suspects arrested for beating a police officer in Times Square were believed to be members of the gang, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
A Tren de Aragua member is also suspected in the kidnap and murder of a 48-year old Florida resident - a Venezuelan national - in early 2024, according to local media reports.
Last summer NBC News reported that the Department of Homeland estimated that 600 Venezuelan migrants in the US had connections to the gang, with 100 believed to be members.
As of 2023, there were 770,000 Venezuelans living in the US, representing slightly less than 2% of all immigrants in the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Most had been given protected status by the US government.
Customs and Border Protection reports encountering 313,500 Venezuelan migrants at the border in 2024.
Trump has often said that Venezuela's crime rate has fallen to record lows because the country ""emptied out its prisons"" by sending migrants to the US.
Statistics kept by the Venezuelan Violence Observatory suggest this might be partly true, with Venezuela's murder rate falling significantly between 2015 and 2023, with some analysts saying that waves of migration - including gang members - created an improved security situation in Venezuelan cities.",Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy871w21d3vo,What is the 1798 law that Trump used to deport migrants?,2025-03-21T13:57:14.833Z,"Sofia Ferreira Santos
BBC News","More than 200 Venezuelans, who the White House alleges are gang members, have been deported from the US to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.
Out of the 261 people deported, 137 were removed under the Alien Enemies Act, a senior administration official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.
This broad, centuries-old law was invoked by President Donald Trump. He accused Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of ""perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion"" on US territory.
The move has been criticised by rights groups, and came despite a temporary block issued by a judge. The White House said the judge's order itself was not lawful and was issued after the group was deported, leading to friction between the Trump administration and the court.
The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an ""enemy"" nation without following the usual processes.
It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.
The act states that ""whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened"" against the US, all ""subjects of the hostile nation or government"" could be ""apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies"".
The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.
It was last invoked in World War II, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.
People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.
Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.
Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.
At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to ""eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil"".
In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an ""invasion"" against the US. He declared its members ""liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies"".
Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.
Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: ""There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.""
Federal judge James Boasberg attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had ""no lawful basis"", and that the removals had already taken place.
This led to a back-and-forth between the federal judge, located in Washington DC, and the government. Boasberg dismissed the government's response to his order as ""woefully insufficient"", and warned of consequences if the Trump administration had violated his ruling.
Donald Trump hit back on social media, saying Boasberg should be impeached and calling him a ""grandstander"".
Reacting to a news article covering the judge's original order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: ""Oopsie... Too late.""
Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it ""unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration"" and ""evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps"".
Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.
""The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings"", she added.",Latin America

The aircraft - operated by Honduran airline Lanhsa - crashed into the sea within a minute of take-off from the island of Roatán.
The Honduran national police and fire department separately said five people had been rescued, while one person is yet to be found.
The cause of the crash is not yet known, but Roatán's mayor told local media it wasn't because of the weather, which was normal. The Honduran Civil Aeronautics Agency said an investigation was under way.
The Jetstream 32 aircraft had taken off from the island's Juan Manuel Gálvez International Airport at 18:18 local time (00:18 GMT on Tuesday), and was bound for Golosón International Airport in La Ceiba on the Honduran mainland.
Civil aviation official Carlos Padilla said, quoted by AFP news agency, that the plane ""made a sharp turn to the right of the runway and fell into the water"".
In a statement on social media, the government expressed ""solidarity"" with the families of the victims.
""The Government of Honduras deeply regrets the tragic accident in Roatán and joins in the national mourning,"" it added.
Following the crash, Honduran President Xiomara Castro ""immediately activated"" the country's emergency committee, comprised of all emergency services including the military, police, fire department, Red Cross and the Ministry of Health.
Writing on X, she said the committee team was ""working tirelessly"" to provide assistance.
""May God protect people's lives,"" Castro added.
Videos shared by officials on social media showed rescue teams working in darkness along a rocky coastline, with small boats and stretchers.
In a post on X accompanied by photos, the Honduran armed forces said survivors with injuries were taken to a hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula by air force planes.

BBC News","A Peruvian fisherman who survived 95 days lost at sea in the Pacific Ocean by eating turtles, birds and cockroaches has been rescued and reunited with his family.
Maximo Napa Castro, 61, set off for what should have been a two-week fishing trip from the coastal town of Marcona, on the southern Peruvian coast, on 7 December.
Ten days in, a storm blew his boat off course, leaving him adrift with dwindling supplies.
His family launched a search, but Peru's maritime patrols were unable to locate him.
It was not until Wednesday that the Ecuadorian patrol vessel Don F found him 1,094km (680 miles) from the coast, dehydrated and in a critical condition.
Maximo survived by catching rainwater in his boat and eating whatever he could find.
In an emotional reunion with his brother in Paita, near the Ecuadorian border, on Friday, he described how he had eaten cockroaches and birds before resorting to sea turtles. His last 15 days were spent without food.
Thinking of his family, including his two-month-old granddaughter, gave him the strength to endure, Mr Castro said.
""I thought about my mother everyday. I'm thankful to God for giving me a second chance.""
His mother, Elena, told local media that, while her relatives remained optimistic during her son's disappearance, she had begun to lose hope.
After his rescue, Mr Castro was taken to Paita for medical assessment before being flown to the Peruvian capital, Lima.
There, at Jorge Chávez International Airport, he was met by his daughter, Inés Napa, in an emotional reunion surrounded by a media scrum. She welcomed him home with a bottle of pisco, Peru's national drink.
In his home district of San Andrés in the Ica region, neighbours and relatives told Peruvian media agency RPP they decorated the streets in celebration.
His niece, Leyla Torres Napa, said the family planned to celebrate his birthday, which passed while he was lost at sea.
She told the agency: ""The day of his birth was unique because all that he could eat [while at sea] was a small cookie, so it is very important for us that we celebrate because, for us, he has been reborn.""
Last year, Russian Mikhail Pichugin was rescued after spending more than two months adrift in a small inflatable boat in the Sea of Okhotsk, to the east of Russia.

Mexico, Central America and Cuba correspondent
Reporting fromTeuchitlán, Mexico","The gates to the Izaguirre Ranch look much like any others you might find in the state of Jalisco. Two prancing horses on the front perhaps a nod to the surrounding cattle-grazing and sugarcane fields.
Yet what lies behind the black iron doors is allegedly evidence of some of Mexico's worst drug cartel violence of recent times.
Following a tip-off about the possible location of a mass grave, an activist group of relatives of some of Mexico's thousands of disappeared people went to the ranch, hoping to find some sign of their missing loved ones.
What they found was far worse: 200 pairs of shoes, hundreds of items of clothing, scores of suitcases and rucksacks, discarded after the owners themselves were apparently disposed of.
Even more chilling, several ovens and human bone fragments were found at the ranch.
The site was used, the activists claim, by the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) for the forced recruitment and training of their foot-soldiers, and for torturing their victims and cremating their bodies.
""There were children's toys in there,"" says Luz Toscano, a member of the Buscadores Guerreros de Jalisco Collective.
""People were desperate,"" she recalls.
""They'd see the shoes and say: 'those look like the ones my missing relative was wearing when they disappeared'.""
Toscano believes the authorities must now go through all the personal effects piece by piece and make them available to the families for closer inspection.
For many, however, the worst part of the gruesome discovery is that local police raided the ranch, near the village of Teuchitlán, as recently as last September.
While at the time they made 10 arrests and released two hostages, they either didn't find or didn't reveal any evidence of the apparent magnitude of violence carried out there.
While the full picture is still to come over what action, if any, was taken by the municipal and state authorities after last year's operation, critics and victims' families openly accuse them of complicity with the cartels in Jalisco.
State Governor Pablo Lemus responded in a video message.
His administration was cooperating fully with the federal authorities, he said, and insisted that ""no one in Jalisco is washing their hands"" of the case.
For Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the events in Jalisco threaten to overshadow a strong start to her presidency.
Given the serious doubts about the actions of the local police and the state attorney general's office, she has ordered federal investigators to take charge of the case.
She urged people not to jump to conclusions while the investigation is ongoing.
""It is important is to make the investigation before we come to any conclusions,"" she said in her morning press briefing earlier this week.
""What did they find at the site? Before anything else, we must hear from the attorney general's office, which is the agency responsible, and they will let the entire country know what they have found.""
Whether most Mexicans will believe the official version of events, however, is another question.
The place is now crawling with police officers, federal investigators and forensics teams in dust overalls.
Whatever they conclude, though, the media in Mexico is calling the Izaguirre Ranch an ""extermination"" site.
Meanwhile, more search teams of victims' relatives have come to the state capital, Guadalajara, ahead of a protest march this weekend to urge the authorities to do more to find Mexico's missing people.
Rosario Magaña was among them. She is the mother of Carlos Amador Magaña, who disappeared in June 2017. He was just 19 years old.
""I still feel desperate, as it's been eight years and I'm still in the same situation,"" she said - speaking of her endless search for her son who was kidnapped along with his best friend.
""It's a very, very slow process when it comes to the state attorney general's office and the investigation.""
""I still have faith and hope of finding him,"" she stressed. ""But I'm in a situation which doesn't move forward, and it's discouraging.""
As she left a church service for the unknown victims at the ranch in Teuchitlán, Rosario said the allegations of mistakes, oversight, collusion and negligence in the case only underlined the uphill struggle mothers like her have faced for years in obtaining answers to the most basic of questions about their children's whereabouts.
""There are so many mass graves in Jalisco, so many cartel safehouses, the authorities know the CJNG's modus operandi. So, what is the government doing?"" she asks rhetorically.",Latin America

Belém, Brazil","A new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belém.
It aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November.
The state government touts the highway's ""sustainable"" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact.
The Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit.
Along the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side - a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Belém.
Diggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area.
Claudio Verequete lives about 200m from where the road will be. He used to make an income from harvesting açaí berries from trees that once occupied the space.
""Everything was destroyed,"" he says, gesturing at the clearing.
""Our harvest has already been cut down. We no longer have that income to support our family.""
He says he has received no compensation from the state government and is currently relying on savings.
He worries the construction of this road will lead to more deforestation in the future, now that the area is more accessible for businesses.
""Our fear is that one day someone will come here and say: 'Here's some money. We need this area to build a gas station, or to build a warehouse.' And then we'll have to leave.
""We were born and raised here in the community. Where are we going to go?""
His community won't be connected to the road, given its walls on either side.
""For us who live on the side of the highway, there will be no benefits. There will be benefits for the trucks that will pass through. If someone gets sick, and needs to go to the centre of Belém, we won't be able to use it.""
The road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife.
Prof Silvia Sardinha is a wildlife vet and researcher at a university animal hospital that overlooks the site of the new highway.
She and her team rehabilitate wild animals with injuries, predominantly caused by humans or vehicles.
Once healed, they release them back into the wild – something she says will be harder if there is a highway on their doorstep.
""From the moment of deforestation, there is a loss.
""We are going to lose an area to release these animals back into the wild, the natural environment of these species,"" she said.
""Land animals will no longer be able to cross to the other side too, reducing the areas where they can live and breed.""
The Brazilian president and environment minister say this will be a historic summit because it is ""a COP in the Amazon, not a COP about the Amazon"".
The president says the meeting will provide an opportunity to focus on the needs of the Amazon, show the forest to the world, and present what the federal government has done to protect it.
But Prof Sardinha says that while these conversations will happen ""at a very high level, among business people and government officials"", those living in the Amazon are ""not being heard"".
The state government of Pará had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns.
Now a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit.
Adler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, listed this highway as one of 30 projects happening in the city to ""prepare"" and ""modernise"" it, so ""we can have a legacy for the population and, more importantly, serve people for COP30 in the best possible way"".
Speaking to the BBC, he said it was a ""sustainable highway"" and an ""important mobility intervention"".
He added it would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, bike lanes and solar lighting. New hotels are also being built and the port is being redeveloped so cruise ships can dock there to accommodate excess visitors.
Brazil's federal government is investing more than $81m (£62m) to expand the airport capacity from ""seven to 14 million passengers"". A new 500,000 sq-m city park, Parque da Cidade, is under construction. It will include green spaces, restaurants, a sports complex and other facilities for the public to use afterwards.
Some business owners in the city's vast open-air Ver-o-peso market agree that this development will bring opportunities for the city.
""The city as a whole is being improved, it is being repaired and a lot of people are visiting from other places. It means I can sell more and earn more,"" says Dalci Cardoso da Silva, who runs a leather shoe stall.
He says this is necessary because when he was young, Belém was ""beautiful, well-kept, well cared for"", but it has since been ""abandoned"" and ""neglected"" with ""little interest from the ruling class"".
João Alexandre Trindade da Silva, who sells Amazonian herbal medicines in the market, acknowledges that all construction work can cause problems, but he felt the future impact would be worth it.
""We hope the discussions aren't just on paper and become real actions. And the measures, the decisions taken, really are put into practice so that the planet can breathe a little better, so that the population in the future will have a little cleaner air.""
That will be the hope of world leaders too who choose to attend the COP30 summit.
Scrutiny is growing over whether flying thousands of them across the world, and the infrastructure required to host them, is undermining the cause.

BBC News","The long-awaited trial of medical staff who treated the late Argentine football legend Diego Maradona has started in the capital, Buenos Aires.
Maradona was convalescing when he died of a heart attack at his home in 2020, aged 60. He had been recovering at home from surgery on a brain blood clot earlier that month.
Prosecutors allege that Maradona's death could have been avoided and accuse the hospital staff of medical negligence.
The defendants say Maradona had refused further treatment and should have stayed in hospital for longer after his operation.
They risk prison terms between eight and 25 years if convicted on the charge of ""homicide with possible intent"".
In an opening statement, the prosecution said it intended to submit ""solid"" evidence that no member of the team ""did what they were supposed to do"" in the ""horror theatre"" that was Maradona's death bed.
""Today, Diego Armando Maradona, his children, his relatives, those closest to him, and the Argentine people, deserve justice,"" prosecutor Patricio Ferrari told the court.
Investigators have classified the case as culpable homicide, a crime similar to involuntary manslaughter, because they said the accused were aware of the seriousness of Maradona's health condition but did not take the necessary measures to save him.
The defendants in the case are a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a medical co-ordinator, a nursing co-ordinator, a doctor and the night nurse.
The night nurse previously said he had seen ""warning signs"", but had received orders ""not to wake"" Maradona.
More than 100 witnesses will testify at the trial, which is expected to last until July.
Diego Maradona is largely considered to be one of the greatest footballers ever to play the game. He was captain when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous ""Hand of God"" goal against England in the quarter-finals.
During the second half of his career, Maradona struggled with cocaine addiction and was banned for 15 months after testing positive for the drug in 1991.

Consistently upbeat and smiling in her videos and in public, her private tears were amplified when she lost her job as a restaurant supervisor - because of her condition, she says - followed by her mortgage and her dream of building her own home.
Six years on, the young mother's sunny persona is the one she uses to fight her public battle: championing the rights of others living with a disability in a country where inequity is rife and crucial resources are in short supply.
She channels her energy into a pioneering non-profit she founded in 2023, Good Humans 268, which strives for a brighter future for people with physical challenges.
""Arthritis has changed my life so much, I can only imagine what it must be like for someone with a major disability,"" Joshuanette tells the BBC.
Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, typically affects older people, but can strike at any age.
""I couldn't believe it when I was diagnosed. My biggest fear was, what happens to life now?"" Joshuanette says.
Good Humans' far-reaching work ranges from pushing for the establishment of an equal rights tribunal to preside over purported discriminatory practices, to a recycling programme that in turn employs local residents with disabilities.
The latter has already been implemented in more than 80 local schools, diverting about a million bottles and cans from the national dump site. Eight people have been hired to sort and process, and sometimes repurpose, the waste.
Good Humans has also launched a nationwide educational programme to encourage more residents to recycle, something Kelisha Pigott was employed to assist with.
She says working with the organisation has been life-changing.
""There are a lot of people with disabilities out there who have no one to turn to. Joshuanette has moulded me to believe in myself more. It's because of her that I took the chance to apply for university and got in,"" Kelisha enthuses.
She hopes her online degree in tourism management will help her eventually merge her small travel company with Good Humans to create additional job opportunities.
""Change starts with us. I was amazed to see how much plastic we diverted from landfill in a short space of time; imagine if everyone did it,"" she says.
There have been some smaller triumphs too. Like the case of the 10-year-old girl who for several years couldn't use the toilet at school unassisted because of the lack of wheelchair-friendly facilities. That indignity went largely overlooked until Joshuanette took it on as a personal endeavour, leading to the creation of an accessible bathroom.
""We must shift the way we do things. People with disabilities must be able to do the same things everyone else can,"" Joshuanette says passionately. ""I'm so excited by what I know Good Humans can achieve.""
Plans include rolling out the recycling scheme to private households and ultimately creating a purpose-built centre to consolidate the group's diverse work.
Still, she's aware of the challenges ahead. Even a stroll around the capital, St John's, is fraught with hazards for many with an impairment, thanks to omnipresent open gutters, crudely covered drains and cracked paving.
""Accessibility is a serious concern,"" says Bernard Warner, head of the country's disability association. ""For a start, there's a lack of access to assistive devices to help people live more meaningfully.""
Both Bernard's group and Good Humans have been calling for legislation passed in 2017, which seeks to protect the rights of those with disabilities, to be enforced. An equal rights tribunal was a key part of the act, but has never been created.
""There's a lot of discrimination; people are treated with indifference or turned away from employment opportunities,"" Bernard says. ""And due to poverty, most don't have money to hire lawyers.""
Bernard lost his right leg when his motorbike was struck by a drunk driver in 1996. Despite a lengthy court case, which ruled in his favour, he has never received compensation.
""After years of torment, I now rally for a better society,"" he explains. ""We have to alter our mindset with how we view people with disabilities. We've been leaving them out for too long. Even now, I see high-rise buildings going up with no disability access,"" he adds.
Kelly Hedges, principal of the Victory Centre for children with special needs, agrees. Her school currently has 27 students aged five to 18.
""The challenge is, when students leave us as young adults, where do they go? People are still wary about hiring people with special needs or disabilities. Unless they have personal connections or can go to work with a parent, they generally just stay home,"" she says.
The Victory Centre is among the schools to have joined Good Humans' recycling scheme.
""As Good Humans becomes bigger and needs more staff, hopefully our children can segue into positions there, become contributing members of society and live more independently,"" Kelly adds.
Joshuanette believes that mental health should be a key focus of disability awareness. Despite her largely positive outlook, she admits depression struck again recently when she turned 30 and still could not afford her own home.
She continues to battle for compensation against the company she says fired her unfairly.
""Fighting is exhausting,"" she says. ""But change will only happen when more people talk about disability and demand change.""",Latin America

Thousand gathered at the city's giant Sambadrome arena to watch the top 12 samba schools battle it out for this year's title.
Beija-Flor was crowned winner on Wednesday for the 15th time, narrowly beating second-placed Grande Rio.
Its performance was an homage to its late director, Luiz Fernando Ribeiro do Carmo, better known as Laíla, who died in June 2021 with Covid-19.
While the overarching theme of Beija-Flor's parade was a tribute to its late director, it also featured floats with pyrotechnic displays and dancers dressed as devils.
The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges.
One of the top 12 samba schools competing for the title was Paraíso do Tuiuti, whose dancers paraded in exuberant feathers.
Among the incredible variety of costumes and performances, Vila Isabel's ghosts clad completely in white were a counterpoint to the kaleidoscopic costumes typical of Rio's carnival.
Performers from the Grande Rio samba school, which came a close second behind Beija-Flor, kept a watchful eye on the parade.
Mocidade delighted spectators with a giant puppet.
Many of the Mocidade's dancers wore futuristic costumes, inspired by its theme song, which this year was entitled Back To The Future - There Are No Limits Dreaming.
Imperatriz came third this year with a parade which included revellers adorned with gold and white skulls.
Portela samba school paid tribute to the legendary Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento. The 82-year-old singer-songwriter waved at the crowd during the parade.
Despite their impressive floats, Unidos de Padre Miguel came last this year and therefore will not be competing in the top tier in 2026.

Reporter, Port of Spain","From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed ""the greatest show on Earth"".
But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.
Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival ""is a big part of our culture"" it also has a very negative environmental impact ""from the events, to the textiles, to costumes"" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.
Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.
Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.
To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.
Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.
""Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,"" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.
The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.
Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (£550), depending on size.
Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. ""'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',"" Danni recalls people saying.
Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.
Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris – who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly
Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.
The two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.
Aliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: ""After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.""
Now she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed ""Tipsy Tuesday"".
They also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.
In what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the ""King of Soca"" and a superstar in the carnival world.
""Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,"" Kaleen explains.
After sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.
""People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',"" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.
But costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.
At Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.
The organisers of the fete - a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools – also hire ""bin detectives"" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.
It is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.
""Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,"" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.
Joseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would ""add some layer of costs and more labour"". But he is adamant ""it worked"" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.
These green efforts are being welcomed by patrons such as Roland Riley, who hailed it as ""a good initiative by Fete with the Saints to go that route"".

Jaroslav Lukiv
BBC News","The government of Haiti says police have launched a large-scale operation in a shantytown controlled by powerful gang leader Jimmy Chérizier, who is widely known as Barbecue.
The authorities say several gang members have been killed in the Lower Delmas area of the capital Port-au-Prince.
Local reports say military drones carrying explosives are being used in the operation.
Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé praised the assault. He said it was the work of a special task force created two days ago to tackle insecurity.
Chérizier, aged 47, is the feared leader of Viv Ansam (Live Together), a coalition of gangs that control much of the city.
It is not clear whether Kenyan police officers deployed in Haiti last year to help fight the gangs are involved in the security operation.
Last week, a Kenyan police officer - who was on patrol with the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission - was killed in a confrontation with gang members.
Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.
More than 5,500 people were killed in gang-related violence in the Caribbean nation in 2024 and more than a million people have fled their homes.

The crash happened early on Saturday about 5km (3 miles) from the south-western city of Uyuni.
One of the drivers was receiving intensive care while the other was in a stable condition, police commander Wilson Flores said.
Images published in Bolivian media showed a badly damaged coach with its bodywork ripped off and luggage scattered on the roadside.
The buses collided on the route between Uyuni and Colchani in Bolivia's Potosí department after a ""lane invasion"", local media reported.
One bus was travelling to the western city of Oruro, where Oruro Carnival - one of Latin America's largest festivals - was taking place.
The vehicles were recovered by 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) and those injured were taken to hospitals in both Oruro and Potosí.
Those who died have not been identified and the condition of the injured is yet to be determined.
According to local media, Cdr Flores said police were awaiting the results of alcohol tests taken by the drivers.

Latin America editor, BBC News Online
Ione Wells
South America correspondent","US President Donald Trump says he will revoke a licence which allowed Venezuela to export some of its oil to the US despite sanctions.
The move is a major blow to the Venezuelan government as the licence provided it, through joint ventures between the state-run oil company and US oil giant Chevron, with a crucial income in dollars.
Trump said he was revoking the licence - which gave Chevron permission to operate in Venezuela - because the government of Nicolás Maduro had failed to meet ""electoral conditions"" and had not transported ""violent criminals"" deported from the US at a quick enough pace.
Venezuela called the decision ""damaging"" and said it could increase migration to the US.
Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, writing that he was ""hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolás Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement, dated November 26, 2022"".
He did not clarify which concessions he was referring to, but the only licence related to Venezuela granted that day was the one issued by the US treasury authorising Chevron to ""resume limited natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela"".
The licence allowed Chevron to operate joint ventures with Venezuela's state-controlled oil company PDVSA, but barred the US company from paying ""any taxes or royalties to the Government of Venezuela"".
Chevron's spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement on Wednesday that ""Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by US government"".
In a recent interview with the Financial Times newspaper, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth argued that if Chevron was forced to pull out of Venezuela, it would allow companies from China and Russia to increase their presence and influence there.
He also warned that Venezuela's economy could suffer more if Chevron left the country, which could drive further migration to the US.
The Venezuelan opposition, on the other hand, has in the past argued for the licence to be revoked, arguing that it provides the Maduro government with ""a financial lifeline"".
The licence was granted in 2022 by the Biden Administration in an attempt to entice the Maduro government to allow free and fair elections.
It remained in place even after Venezuela's government-aligned electoral council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential election in July 2024 - a result which has been refuted by the opposition and by a number of countries, including the US, which have recognised Maduro's rival as the legitimate winner instead.
President Trump's announcement came less than a month after his envoy, Richard Grenell, met with Nicolás Maduro in Caracas.
During his visit, Grenell secured the release of six US citizens who had been held in Venezuela, as well as a deal under which the Maduro government sent planes to the US to fetch deported Venezuelans.
In his Truth Social post, Trump said ""the regime has not been transporting the violent criminals that they sent into our Country (the Good Ole' U.S.A.) back to Venezuela at the rapid pace that they had agreed to"".
He added he was ""therefore ordering that the ineffective and unmet Biden 'Concession Agreement' be terminated"" as of 1 March.
Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez warned that US sanctions had in the past led to an increase of Venezuelans migrating to the US and that this was likely to happen again.
Stopping undocumented migration has been one of Trump's main priorities since taking office.
The announcement had a swift effect on oil prices, which rose more than 1% on Thursday.",Latin America

BBC News","More than eight million households across Chile were left without power on Tuesday afternoon after an electricity transmission line failed, cutting off the electricity supply to much of the country.
In the capital, Santiago, the entire underground train system was suspended almost immediately. Thousands of people had to be evacuated and stations were plunged into darkness.
""We were like sardines in the dark,"" one passenger described the moment their underground train stalled.
Many of those who had been in lifts inside the stations when the power cut happened had to be freed by firefighters.
One woman in her 70s was trapped in a lift between two floors in a building in Santiago.
She told local media that she had ""kicked the door"" of the lift to draw attention to her plight and her screams eventually alerted the concierge.
""I'm brave, I told myself 'I'm not going to die here',"" she said.
Videos shared on social media also showed metro passengers using their mobile phones' flashlights to find their way out of dark stations.
According to Metro de Santiago, the evacuation of the underground was completed 90 minutes after the power cut - but disruption caused by the outage carried on for many more hours.
The 150 extra buses deployed to ferry passengers were not nearly enough to make up for the suspension of the metro, which transports an average of 2.3m passengers every day.
Long queues formed at bus stops, where passengers grew increasingly angry when packed buses did not stop.
Their numbers soon swelled with workers sent home early because most offices were paralysed by the lack of electricity.
""The power went out at 3:00pm, so we had no power at all,"" one shopkeeper in Santiago said. ""People started closing up at around 4 or 5pm.""
Traffic in the capital was further disrupted by the failure of several traffic lights.
A truck collided with a car at one crossing where the traffic lights were out and there were reports of at least one other accident also caused by the lack of functioning traffic lights.
With the gridlock getting worse, thousands of people were forced to walk to their destinations in summer temperatures of around 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit).
One of them, Sharon Ortiz, a 28-year-old waitress, told AFP news agency that the public transport system had ""collapsed"".
""I got to work two hours late, I got stuck in the middle of the Costanera [shopping centre] and from there I had to walk,"" she said.
Some people hitched lifts on the back of trucks.
Restaurants and cafes were among the businesses affected by the power cut.
Some remained open to offer those walking home a place to rest, but many closed because cash machines, card machines and fridges were not working.
Some of the most dramatic scenes unfolded in Fantasilandia, an amusement park in Santiago, where at least a dozen people were stuck on top of a rollercoaster.
Fantasilandia's manager said that while the park had backup generators, the attractions would not immediately restart for security reasons.
Hospitals relied on emergency generators for power.
As the sun set, the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew from 22:00 to 06:00 local time.
Soldiers and police were deployed to maintain order.
Some Chileans tried to see a positive in the power cut - with several posting photos of the night sky on social media, pointing out that the lack of light pollution had made the milky way easier to see.",Latin America

The national service for disaster prevention and response said earlier that the outage stretched from the regions of Arica and Parinacota in the north to Los Lagos in the south.
Reuters news agency reported that the world's largest copper mine, Escondida, was without power, citing a source close to the matter.
Latam Airlines said some of its flights might also be disrupted while power supplies were down, and urged passengers to check their journey status.

There were also long queues for buses which were still running on the city's roads.

Vente Venezuela's leader, María Corina Machado, said she held ""the regime"" of Nicolás Maduro responsible for Araujo's death.
According to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory NGO, 20 political prisoners have died while in custody over the past few years.
Vente Venezuela said Araujo had been seized by masked men on 9 January during a protest on the eve of the swearing in of Nicolás Maduro for a third term as president.
His wife said he had been returning from a medical appointment and had merely been observing the protest when he was taken away.
He had been in state custody since then.

His wife accuses the authorities of failing to providing her husband with medical care until it was too late, even though she had warned them that his health had been deteriorating.
The head of the regional body Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, denounced Araujo's death, writing on X that it was a ""new atrocity of the regime"".
He added: ""No more political prisoners, no more torture, no more death.""
Almagro has been an outspoken critic of Nicolás Maduro, accusing the Venezuelan leader of repressing the opposition in the run-up and the aftermath of July's presidential election.
Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), a body closely aligned with the government, declared Maduro the winner of the election without providing detailed voting tallies to back up their claim.
The OAS's electoral observation department said it could not recognise the result because the CNE ""was biased towards the government"".
Venezuela's opposition coalition also refused to recognise the result, saying that voting tallies it had gathered, with the help of official election observers, showed that its candidate, Edmundo González, was the overwhelming winner.
The opposition also organised protests on the eve of Maduro's swearing in and it was at one such event that Reinaldo Araujo was seized.
According to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory, hundreds of protesters were arrested in the days leading up to Maduro's inauguration and sent to jails notorious for the mistreatment of detainees.
Among those seized was Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Edmundo González.
Mr Tudares's wife says she has not been given any information about her husband's whereabouts since he was taken away by the security forces on 7 January.

Mexican security forces say the arrest of Canobbio, who they say was in charge of security for Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, is a severe blow to the Sinaloa cartel.
He was captured just hours after the United States added the Sinaloa cartel to its list of foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs), a move which the Trump Administration says will allow it to better combat the criminal groups.

Mexican security forces will hope that the arrest of Canobbio - who was indicted in absentia by a federal grand jury in Chicago in November for allegedly smuggling fentanyl into the US - will go some way towards showing their commitment to the fight against drug trafficking.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw3l7p79po,Fog harvesting could provide water for arid cities,2025-02-20T05:13:30.623Z,"Victoria Gill
Science correspondent, BBC News","Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.
This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.
Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.
""Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,"" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. ""There is a lot of poverty"", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.
Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.
However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.
Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.
It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.
However, Dr Carter says a ""new era"" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.
She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.
From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.
Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.
Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:
Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.
With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.
Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is ""very special"" for its sea fog, ""because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains"".
Her team is currently working on a ""fog harvesting map"" of the whole country.
""Water from the clouds"", as Dr Carter describes it, could, she said, ""enhance our cities' resilience to climate change, while improving access to clean water"".

BBC World Service Americas editor","Brazil's chief prosecutor has accused former President Jair Bolsonaro of leading an attempted coup after the ex-leader was defeated by his left-wing rival in the 2022 presidential election.
According to the prosecutor, the alleged plot aimed to prevent Bolsonaro's successor in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from taking office and included a plan to poison Lula.
Bolsonaro, 69, denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political witch hunt.
It is now up to Brazil's Supreme Court to decide whether to accept the prosecutor's charges and put Bolsonaro and 33 others accused on trial.
In a sign of how divided Brazil remains two-and-a-half years after the bitterly fought presidential election, critics of Bolsonaro celebrated news of the charges, saying that the former president belonged in jail, while his supporters insisted he was innocent.
The focus is now on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who will have to weigh up the merits of the accusations made by the chief prosecutor and decide whether the case should proceed to the trial stage.
There is no deadline for Mr Moraes to make his decision, but legal experts quoted in Brazilian media said they expected him to rule in favour of a trial, which could get under way later this year.
Political analysts say a potential trial could have an impact on the 2026 presidential election.
While Bolsonaro is barred from running for office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he remains a strong political force.
Many think he could use a potential trial as a platform for his agenda.
In his 272-page report, Attorney-General Paulo Gonet said that he had concluded that Bolsonaro and the 33 other accused had formed a criminal group which had tried to instigate a coup against Lula's newly elected government - an allegation those named have denied.
The document alleges that Bolsonaro and his vice-presidential candidate Walter Braga Netto led the group.
""Allied with other individuals, including civilians and military personnel, they attempted to prevent, in a co-ordinated manner, the result of the 2022 presidential elections from being fulfilled,"" it reads.
According to the report, the alleged plot included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Alexandre de Moraes - the same Supreme Court justice now tasked with deciding whether the case should proceed to trial.
The prosecutor's charges are based on a police investigation into the events leading up to 8 January 2023, when Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the capital, Brasilia.
Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 people.
Bolsonaro was in the United States at the time and has always denied any links to the rioters. But the prosecutor's report alleges that he started sowing doubts about Brazil's voting system as early as July 2021, which are thought to have encouraged those storming Congress.
Lawyers representing the former president said they were ""astonished"" by the accusations levelled against their client and insisted that he had never supported any movement aimed at dismantling Brazil's democratic rule of law or the institutions that uphold it.
The said the prosecutor had come up with a ""fanciful narrative"" that would not stand up to legal scrutiny.",Latin America

BBC News","A British journalist has been reported missing in Brazil, prompting concerns from an association of foreign correspondents which has urged authorities to step up search efforts.
Charlotte Peet, 32, is understood to have last contacted a friend on 8 February, saying she was in São Paulo and planned to travel to Rio de Janeiro. She has not been heard from since.
Days later, her UK-based family told the friend they had lost contact with her. They have provided authorities with details of her flight and a copy of her passport to aid the search.
The Association of Foreign Press Correspondents in Brazil (ACIE) released a statement ""expressing concern over her disappearance and solidarity with her family and friends"".
According to the statement, someone initially reported the case to police in Rio before it was transferred to São Paulo, where she was last seen.
The statement also added that Brazil's Department of Homicides and Personal Protection (DHPP) was assisting in the case.
According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms Peet has worked as a freelance journalist in Rio and London for outlets including Al Jazeera and the Times.
""Her disappearance has sparked growing concern among colleagues and journalists in the region, with ACIE calling for intensified efforts to locate her as soon as possible"", a statement on behalf of its president Edmar Figueiredo and its board of directors said.

The vehicle plunged almost 800m (2625 ft) into a ravine in the southwestern district of Yocalla, an officer said.
Fourteen people were also injured, including four children, an official from a local hospital said in a video.
Bolivia has notoriously dangerous roads, particularly in mountainous areas.
The accident happened between the cities of Potosí and Oruro, police said.
Officials believe that the crash could have been caused by speeding, with the driver ""unable"" to control the bus, police colonel Victor Benavides told the AFP news agency.
This is believed to be the most serious road accident reported in the South American country so far this year.
Local news outlet Unitel reported that several of those injured were in a serious condition.
Deadly road accidents are common in Bolivia.
Last month, 19 people were killed when another bus came off a road, also near Potosí.

BBC News","The Mexican army says it has seized more than four tonnes of methamphetamine in raids conducted in the violence-wracked state of Sinaloa over the weekend.
Soldiers raided warehouses and drug labs in Higueras de Abuya, a village about 75km (45 miles) south of the state capital, Culiacán.
A spokesman for the army said the seizure of such a large amount of the synthetic drug - which in some forms is known by its street name crystal meth - would constitute a hard blow to whichever criminal gang was behind the labs.
Mexico's security minister has deployed thousands of troops to the northern state of Sinaloa an effort to reign in the drug cartels that are active there.
The seizure of the powerful and highly addictive stimulant comes just two weeks after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum managed to convince US President Donald Trump to hold off imposing a 25% duty on Mexican imports to the US for a month.
One of the reasons Trump had cited for imposing the tariffs was the flow of drugs from Mexico to the US.
He also accused the Mexican government of having ""an intolerable alliance"" with drug trafficking organisations.
While the deployment of some extra troops to Sinaloa predates the spat between the US and Mexico over tariffs, the seizure of the methamphetamine stash will be welcome news to the Mexican government, which wants to demonstrate to the US that it is playing its part in trying to combat drug cartels.
Hamlet Toledo, deputy operative chief of the army general staff, told reporters that in addition to the four tonnes of methamphetamine seized this weekend, the army had also secured another large meth stash last week, bringing the total to more than five tonnes.
General Toledo said that one of the warehouses where the drugs were found appeared to have housed between 15 and 20 people, who are thought to have fled before the soldiers arrived.
The soldiers who located the labs had become suspicious when they spotted vats of precursor chemicals - needed to make the drug - outside the properties.",Latin America

Reporter, St John's, Antigua","It is not cricket or politics that triggers the most ardent debate in Antigua and Barbuda.
It is the ingredients of a beloved national dish.
The question of whether ""ducana"" – a sweet potato and coconut dumpling – should or should not contain raisins has divided local residents for decades.
The piquant pudding is one of many foods widely eaten in the Caribbean country that has its origins in Africa and has survived to this day.
And its inclusion in a national inventory of cultural heritage currently being created looks set to reignite the jocular dispute.
Antigua and Barbuda's traditional food is just one aspect of the work under way to preserve the twin isles' distinct features for posterity.
The inventory will also include its unique dialect, bush medicine, games, crafts, architecture and boat-building techniques.
The mammoth venture, being funded by the United Nations cultural body, Unesco, follows concerns that key elements of the country's cultural identity are being lost, explains project leader Dr Hazra Medica.
""There is no longer the traditional transmission of knowledge from older to younger people,"" she tells the BBC.
""Without that, we start to lose the sense of who we are. Outside influences can dilute indigenous culture and people fear that what is peculiarly Antiguan will be lost.""
More than two dozen specially trained data collectors have been tasked with interviewing residents from each parish, gathering stories, photos and information. The results will be meticulously entered into a publicly accessible database.
Local author Joy Lawrence needed little encouragement to take part.
The former schoolteacher's books focus heavily on the country's Creole/English dialect that weaves in many African words from Antiguans' ancestors.
English may be the main language but patois, spoken at accelerated speed, is ubiquitous and routinely used to show kinship and camaraderie.
""When the British brought Africans here, they could not speak English and the British could not speak African languages. Because the Africans came from all over and spoke different languages, they could not even converse among themselves for the most part,"" Ms Lawrence says.
""To communicate, the Africans borrowed some vocabulary from the British and incorporated their own pronunciation and syntax to form a pidgin thing. Over the generations, it became perfected and developed structure and grammar.""
A couple of generations ago, Antiguan dialect was sneered at and children were commonly forbidden to speak it in school. There are still some who look down their nose at it today, Ms Lawrence scoffs.
""Our forebears worked hard to coin that language,"" she asserts. ""It's our first language; how can we not preserve what's ours? It's not a written language and we spell it any old how, but it has rhythm and I'm proud of it.""
The dialect is characterised by an ""economy of words"" and sparse pronouns, she continues.
""We don't waste time to say 'not at all'; we just say 'tarl'. Instead of 'come here', we say 'cumyah'. And we never say her or him; it's always she or he.""
In places such as school and church, dialect is used for ""emphasis, clarity and reinforcement"". ""Because we think in it,"" Ms Lawrence adds.
Disagreements over the ""correct"" way of doing something is one reason for the decline of some cultural practices, Dr Medica believes.
Varying methods of stirring ""fungee"", a cornmeal paste which also hails from the mother continent, and precisely what to add to it is another subject of friendly bickering.
""There's this idea that this is how it's done and should always be done. Sometimes younger people are turned off by not doing it 'right'.
""In the workshops, we saw the 'fungee war'. Antiguans say it should have okra in it, while Barbudans add peas, which made some gasp in shock,"" Dr Medica smiles.
Novella Payne – who produces a range of teas, sauces and seasonings under her ""Granma Aki"" brand – learnt everything she knows from her mother and grandmother, but adds her ""own twist"" to time-honoured recipes.
""The seasoning is what sets Antiguan food apart – garlic, onion, thyme and seasoning peppers,"" she explains.
Many of Ms Payne's creations feature local medicinal plants, long used to treat everything from coughs and fever to rashes and nausea. Soursop, lemongrass, noni and moringa regularly appear in her syrups and juices.
""Our food is delicious, nutritious and should be preserved because it's part of our culture and heritage,"" she adds.
The project recently got under way in Antigua's sister isle, Barbuda, where Dwight Benjamin is striving to keep the art of traditional broom-making alive.
Mr Benjamin uses palm leaves, which must be sun-dried for two days, to create the bristles before weaving them on to a stick crafted from a bay tree.
The techniques were passed on to him by his grandfather and Mr Benjamin, an accountant by profession, is one of few people still making and selling the brooms.
He says they remain in high demand among Barbuda's residents.
""I may be biased, but I find them more effective than store-bought brooms - you feel the difference when you use them. They cover more ground too,"" he says.
""It's not widely practised anymore, but it's something we should cherish and document. I'm hoping my son will pick it up.""
For Dr Medica, the project has deeper significance still.
""When we talk about culture in Caribbean islands, we tend to forget the engagement with our colonial past and the impact of that. We're told that our history began when Africans were brought here, projecting this notion that we came as empty vessels with no memory,"" she says.
""The great thing about this work is the huge evidence of African cultural retention. As a people we can claim, 'This is us.'
""In dialect, when someone treats you unfairly, we say 'me smaddy [somebody] too',"" she adds. ""And that's what this whole project is; it's a claim to personhood.""",Latin America

BBC Mundo","The first thing kayaker Adrián Simancas noticed after he was eaten by a whale was the slime.
""I spent a second realising I was inside the mouth of something, that maybe it had eaten me, that it could have been an orca or a sea monster,"" the 23-year-old told BBC Mundo.
Adrián had started to think how he might survive inside the humpback whale ""like Pinocchio"" - then the creature spat him back out.
The Venezuelan kayaker had been paddling through the Strait of Magellan, off Chile's Patagonian coast, with his father when he felt something ""hit me from behind, closing in on me and sinking me"".
His father, Dell, was able to capture the short-lived ordeal on video just metres away.
""I closed my eyes, and when I opened them again, I realised I was inside the whale's mouth,"" Adrián told the BBC.
""I felt a slimy texture brush my face,"" he recalled, adding that all he could see was dark blue and white.
""I wondered what I could do if it had swallowed me since I could no longer fight to stop it,"" he said.
""I had to think about what to do next.""
But within seconds, Adrián started to feel as though he was rising toward the surface.
""I was a little afraid of whether I would be able to hold my breath because I didn't know how deep I was, and I felt like it took me a long time to come up.
""I went up for two seconds, and finally I got to the surface and realised that it hadn't eaten me.""
In a nearby kayak, Adrián's father Dell Simancas watched on in disbelief.
The pair had just crossed Eagle Bay - down the coast from Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city - when he heard a crash behind him. ""When I turned around, I didn't see Adrián.""
""I was worried for a second, until I saw him coming up out of the sea,"" the 49-year-old said.
""Then I saw something, a body, which I immediately interpreted as most likely being a whale because of its size.""
Dell had fixed a camera to the back of his kayak to record the rising waves - which captured his son's remarkable experience.
Watching the footage back, Adrián - who moved with his father to Chile from Venezuela seven years ago in search of a better quality of life - was shocked to see just how enormous the whale had been.
""I hadn't seen the moment when the back appears, and the fin is visible. I didn't see it, I heard it. That made me nervous,"" he said.
""But later, with the video, I realised that it actually appeared before me in such a huge size that perhaps if I had seen it, it would have scared me even more.""
For Adrián, the experience was not just about survival - but he said felt he had received a ""second chance"" when the whale spat him out.
The ""unique"" experience in one of the most extreme places on Earth had ""invited me to reflect on what I could have done better up until that point, and on the ways I can take advantage of the experience and appreciate it as well"", he added.
But there is a simple reason he was able to escape the whale so quickly, according to a wildlife expert.
Humpback whales have narrow throats ""about the size of a household pipe"" designed for swallowing small fish and shrimp, Brazilian conservationist Roched Jacobson Seba told the BBC.
""They physically cannot swallow large objects like kayaks, tires, or even big fish like tuna,"" he said.
""Ultimately, the whale spit out the kayak because it was physically impossible to swallow.""
The humpback whale likely engulfed Adrián by accident, Mr Seba suggested.
""The whale was likely feeding on a school of fish when it unintentionally scooped up the kayak along with its meal.
""When whales surface too quickly while feeding, they can accidentally hit or engulf objects in their path.""
He warned that the encounter served as ""an important reminder"" to avoid using paddleboards, surfboards or other silent vessels in areas where whales usually swim.
Boats used for whale watching and research must always keep their engines on, he added, as the noise helps whales detect their presence.

BBC News","A Brazilian woman suspected of poisoning her husband's family with an arsenic-laced Christmas cake has been found dead in her prison cell in what police think was most likely a suicide.
Deise Moura dos Anjos, 42, had been in pre-trial detention since January after prosecutors accused her of the murder on Christmas Eve of three relatives and the attempted murder of another three.
The victims had all eaten from the cake, which forensic experts found had been baked with flour contaminated with the deadly poison.
Police were also investigating if she may have killed her father-in-law, who died in September.
Forensic experts who exhumed his body found high levels of arsenic, which led them to believe that he, too, had been poisoned.
Moura dos Anjos denied any wrongdoing but local police chief Cléber dos Santos Lima told reporters last month that he was ""certain that she researched, bought (...) and used the poison to kill her victims"".
He added that police had found evidence showing that she had bought arsenic on four separate occasions.
Investigators tested many food items in the home of Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, where the six victims were taken ill, in order to find the source of the poisoning.
Eventually, they found sky-high levels or arsenic in the flour - some of which Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, Zeli dos Anjos, had used to bake the Christmas cake.
As Zeli dos Anjos had herself eaten from the cake and was taken seriously ill, police quickly ruled her out as a suspect even though she had prepared the cake.
Zeli dos Anjos survived but two of her sisters and one of her nieces died.

At least 55 of the around 70 people on board were killed in the accident, which happened in the early hours of Monday, local time.
Rescuers struggled to recover the bodies from the creek into which the bus had plunged.
Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo has declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the crash, one of the deadliest road traffic accidents in the region for years.
The bus normally covered the route between San Cristóbal Acasaguastlán and Guatemala City, officials said.
On Monday it had reportedly left the village of San Antonio La Paz at around 04:00 local time.
About 30 minutes later, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, it plunged 20m (65ft) from a bridge into a creek carrying wastewater.
Photos from the scene show the bus, lying on its roof, wheels in the air, in the shallow water.
Local media said the bus had been full of students, commuters, and people on their way to the capital for medical appointments.
As news of the accident spread, worried relatives gathered at the foot of the bridge waiting for news of their loved ones.
One woman told Guatemalan news site La Hora that her 67-year-old husband had set off at four in the morning but had never made it to work.
Another woman had identified the body of her brother, who had been on board the bus.
Rescue workers said they had retrieved 53 bodies so far.
Two people who had been rescued alive from the wreck died in hospital, bringing the total number of dead to 55.
The 24-year-old driver is reportedly among those who died.
Eyewitnesses described seeing the vehicle crash into two cars before it hit the guardrail and fell into the precipice.
Investigators said they would check if the driver could have lost control due to a brake failure.
Guatemala's communications minister, Miguel Díaz Bobadilla, told reporters the bus was around 30 years old but had a valid licence for carrying passengers.
Díaz Bobadilla added that officials were checking if it may have carried more weight than it should have.
Police are also investigating a gun they found on board the bus.
The discovery of the weapon has given rise to speculation in local media that the driver may have panicked or been injured when he was threatened with the gun.

Reporting fromQuito","Ecuador's presidential election will go to a second round after a closely contested first-round result failed to produce an outright winner.
The electoral authorities called it a ""technical tie"" after the incumbent centre-right candidate, Daniel Noboa, and his main left-wing challenger Luisa González received nearly identical percentages of the vote.
The pair will now face a run-off in April. The result is far narrower than opinion polls had predicted, indicating the second round could be harder to call.
As of 17:00 local time (22:00 GMT), with more than 94% of the ballots counted, Noboa had a 44.2% share of the vote and González 43.9%, according to local media.
The narrow result also dashed the hopes of Noboa's supporters, who had been buoyed by an early exit poll suggesting he might clinch victory outright.
The president's supporters gathered in Quito, waving flags, donning T-shirts with his image and holding life-size cardboard cut-outs of the incumbent president.
These cut-outs, depicting Noboa in various outfits – from suits to tank tops and sunglasses – have become ubiquitous symbols across the country decorating front doors, apartment windows, and even car rooftops.
Noboa's presidency has been defined by his focus on tackling severe gang violence.
He implemented emergency measures to deploy the military to streets and prisons to curb rising crime.
Many of his supporters hope he will secure a mandate in the run-off to continue his security policies.
""He's helped us a lot, from when there was gang violence so bad that we couldn't even go out,"" said Fernanda Iza.
The 45-year-old added: ""The support of the military he's introduced – their presence is already helping.
""He has brought us a certain stability. There are many problems still pending, but I hope he continues with his plan.""
Juan Diego Escobar, 16, expressed optimism about Noboa's chances.
""I think the majority of people who voted for other candidates will prefer to vote for Daniel Noboa in the second round,"" he said.
""Noboa handles insecurity well. Crime is fairly well controlled. I think he will also improve the economy.""
Miriam Naranjo said despite being the incumbent, Noboa represented ""change"".
She added: ""We need the work that he has been doing so far to continue. It's only been a short time. We were expecting a bigger margin, so we have to work to keep that support for our candidate.""
Despite some successes, such as the capture of some major gang leaders and a slight reduction in prison violence, violent crime remains a major issue.
Violent deaths fell in 2024 but stayed near record levels. In January 2025 alone 750 homicides were reported.
González – a protégé of former president Rafael Correa – has criticised Noboa for failing to deliver on key promises, such as boosting the economy, cutting fuel prices, and addressing violent crime.
While she has proposed similar military and police operations to combat crime, her campaign has emphasised increased social spending in Ecuador's most violent regions.
Noboa's critics also accused him of a slow response to a severe drought that led to prolonged power cuts last year.
The incumbent also sparked controversy during the campaign by refusing to delegate his presidential duties to Vice-President Verónica Abad, citing an electoral law loophole.
This decision became part of a public spat between the two.
Luisa González's supporters see her as a chance for change.
Gonzalo Cajas, 46, said: ""Why is there crime? There is poverty. There is hunger. So there should be someone who is really aware of Ecuadorean workers so that the country moves forward.""
Alejandra Tufiño, 42, added: ""The country's security is in pieces. I want change. I'm not saying that she's going to solve it – but let's see what happens if we give her a chance.""
Some voters remain disillusioned with both candidates.
Gabriela Cajo, 39, who backed a candidate from the party of assassinated 2023 presidential hopeful Fernando Villavicencio, expressed frustration with the lack of progress on crime.
""Daniel Noboa represents fear, and we represent hope, change. We do not want a state of war, we want peace,"" she said.
""I think we are all annoyed with the electoral processes in the country, and the last thing we want is a second round and more expenditure of resources.
""There will be tremendous polarisation. There will be a lot of opposition to whoever wins. Once again, we will have to choose who is the least worst.""
Whoever is victorious in April will face significant challenges.
Ecuador continues to grapple with rampant crime, as drug cartels battle for control of lucrative trafficking routes through its ports. Kidnappings and murders remain daily occurrences.
The country is also struggling with high unemployment, a weak economy, and an energy crisis that caused blackouts of up to 14 hours last year.
Noboa has pledged to address these issues by creating jobs, attracting investment, and increasing renewable energy production.
Meanwhile, González has emphasised the need for economic reform, social investment, and a stronger focus on tackling poverty.",Latin America

Officials say the earthquake's epicentre was about 20 miles (32.1km) north of Honduras and 130 miles (209.2km) south-west of the Cayman Islands when it struck on Saturday evening local time.
The US Tsunami Warning System had initially issued warnings to more than a dozen of countries - including waves of up to three metres (10ft). But, it later said the threat had passed.
Advisories were also issued by the Tsunami Warning System for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands following the earthquake - which were both also later cancelled.
The Cayman Islands government had warned residents of coastal areas to move inland in a message on its website.
It is unclear if there has been any movement or damage on land.
The quake was the biggest to hit the region since 2021, when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
About three hours after the earthquake, US authorities warned that ""minor sea level fluctuations"" of up to 30cm (11.8 inches) could still occur, but that any serious threat had passed.
The USGS said large earthquakes at this location of the plate boundary are not unexpected.
In 2018 a 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred nearby, causing some damage and a small tsunami, it said.
""Luckily, the remote location of these earthquakes limits the potential for significant damage due to shaking,"" it added.

There is silence, except for the swish of his broom across the floor of the small museum he runs documenting the life of his community in Panama, the Guna.
""Before, you could hear children shouting… music everywhere, neighbours arguing,"" he says, ""but now all the sounds have gone"".
His community, living on the tiny low-lying island of Gardi Sugdub, is the first in Panama to be relocated because of climate change.
The government has said they face ""imminent risk"" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.
In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.
The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.
""My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,"" says Delfino. ""Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.
House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.
He says he wants to stay close to the ocean, where he can fish. ""The people that lose their tradition lose their soul. The essence of our culture is on the islands,"" he adds.
The Guna have lived on Gardi Sugdub since the 19th Century, and even longer on other islands in this archipelago off Panama's northern coast. They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups.
They are known for their clothes called ""molas"", decorated with colourful designs.
The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands. Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is ""almost a certainty"" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century.
As climate change causes the Earth to heat up, sea levels are rising as glaciers and ice sheets melt and seawater expands as it warms.
Scientists warn that hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas around the world could be at risk by the end of the century.
On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.
Mr Paton says, ""it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise"".
However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.
The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Martínez, fear the rising sea:
""Every year, we saw the tides were higher,"" she says. ""We couldn't cook on our stoves and it was always flooded… so we said 'we have to get out of here'.""
Magdalena was among those who clambered into motor boats and wooden canoes last June, bound for new homes.
""I brought just my clothes and some kitchen utensils,"" she says. ""You feel like you are leaving pieces of your life on the island.""
The new community, Isberyala, is - weather permitting - just 15 minutes by boat, followed by a five-minute drive, from Gardi Sugdub. But it feels like another world.
Identical white and yellow homes line tarmacked roads.
Magdalena's eyes light up as she shows off the ""little house"" where she lives with her 14-year-old granddaughter Bianca and her dog.
Each house has a small area of land behind it – a luxury not available on the island. ""I want to plant yucca, tomatoes, bananas, mangoes and pineapples,"" she enthuses.
""It is quite sad to leave a place you've been in for so long. You miss your friends, the streets where you lived, being so close to the sea,"" she says.
Isberyala was built with $15m (£12m) from the Panamanian government and additional funding from the Inter-American Development Bank.
In its new meeting house, which is roofed with branches and leaves in the traditional style, waits Tito López, the community's sayla – or leader.
""My identity and my culture aren't going to change, it's just the houses that have changed,"" he says.
He is lying in a hammock, and explains that as long as the hammock keeps its place in Guna culture, ""the heart of the Guna people will be alive"".
When a Guna dies, they lie for a day in their hammock for family and friends to visit. It is then buried next to them.
In the state-of-the-art new school, students aged 12 and 13 are rehearsing Guna music and dances. Boys in bright shirts play pan pipes, while girls wearing molas shake maracas.
The cramped school on the island has closed now, and students whose families stayed there travel each day to the new building with its computers, sports fields and library.
Magdalena says conditions in Isberyala are better than on the island, where she says they had only four hours of electricity a day and had to fetch drinking water by boat from a river on the mainland.
In Isberyala, the power supply is constant, but the water - pumped from wells nearby - is only switched on for a few hours a day. The system has at times broken down for days at a time.
Also, there is no healthcare yet. Another resident, Yanisela Vallarino, says one evening her young daughter was unwell and she had to arrange transport back to the island late at night to see a doctor.
Panamanian authorities told the BBC that construction of a hospital in Isberyala stalled a decade ago over lack of funding. But they said they hoped to revive the plan this year, and were assessing how to create space for remaining residents to move from the island.
Yanisela is delighted that she is now able to attend evening classes in the new school, but she still returns to the island frequently.
""I'm not used to it yet. And I miss my house,"" she says.
Communities around the world will be ""inspired"" by the way the residents of Gardi Sugdub have confronted their situation, says Erica Bower, a researcher on climate displacement at Human Rights Watch.
""We need to learn from these early cases to understand what success even looks like,"" she says.
As afternoon arrives, the school activities give way to the shouts and scuffles of football, basketball and volleyball.
""I prefer this place to the island because we have more space to play,"" says eight-year-old Jerson, before diving for a football.
Magdalena sits with her granddaughter, teaching her to sew molas.
""It's hard for her, but I know she's going to learn. Our unique ways can't be lost,"" says Magdalena.
Asked what she misses about the island, she replies: ""I wish we were all here.""",Latin America

South America correspondent
Reporting fromGuayaquil, Ecuador","""The entire town feels like it is in a pandemic, locked up without being able to go out and enjoy our lives due to violence.""
That is how ""Jorge"" - not his real name - feels about his neighbourhood of Guayaquil, a city in southern Ecuador.
His father, Marcos Elías León Maruri, was kidnapped there by the Los Tiguerones gang.
A person is killed every two hours in Ecuador and seven are kidnapped daily, according to government figures.
That's why security is the top issue for voters ahead of the first round of the presidential election on Sunday, in which incumbent Daniel Noboa is being challenged by 15 other candidates.
Whoever wins will be tasked with restoring security to the country, which has gone from being one of the safest to among the most dangerous in the region.
The surge in violence is partly down to Ecuador's location, and the soaring demand for cocaine in the drug's biggest markets like the US, the UK, and Europe.
Much of the world's cocaine, from coca leaves grown in Colombia and Peru, leaves the continent through Ecuador's ports, and powerful gangs battle to control this lucrative route.
Many of these gangs also engage in kidnapping for ransom.
Mr León Maruri was one of their victims.
Hours after he was seized, Jorge received a text. It read: ""I have your father. How much will you pay for the life of your family?""
The next morning, he received a video showing his father tied up with his finger being cut off.
The gang initially demanded $100,000 (£80,000).
Jorge didn't have it and began negotiating: ""They wanted $30,000 or they would cut off another finger.""
Jorge scrambled to offer them $5,000 and his television, PlayStation and car.
Just as the captors had agreed on a handover, police called him. They'd found a corpse resembling his father.
""They had left my father's body with his finger in a bottle tied to his hand – as a mockery.""
Jorge's life has since unravelled. He rarely leaves his home, now plastered with CCTV cameras he anxiously monitors.
His wife and daughter have fled the country. He doesn't go to work any more because the gang know the location.
The current government under President Daniel Noboa has responded to the surge in violence by militarising the streets, giving police heightened powers to use force and raid buildings, and by building new maximum-security prisons.
Jorge supports these measures but criticises the justice system.
""The government is working hard against corruption and equipping the police a lot. But it is of no use if the justice system sets them free. They care more about their rights than ours.""
While some, like Jorge, back Noboa's measures, others feel they enable human rights abuses – a key tension in this election.
I put this to Major Cristian Aldaz, from the Federal Police, during a raid in the violence-wracked city of Durán, as heavily armed security forces detained a man accused of kidnap and murder.
""Human rights, yes, but what about human rights for good people? We're in a war. Mafias use machine guns, grenades. The militarisation aims to establish peace,"" he says.
Polls still have Noboa as the front-runner, but he has lost some ground in recent months to his main rival, Luisa González of the left-wing Citizen Revolution movement.
On the campaign trail, González has promised human rights training for the security forces - although she also expressed support for the militarisation and tougher policing, including pledging 20,000 new officers.
There is one case, in particular, that has made many Ecuadoreans fear the indiscriminate use of force by the security forces.
Last year, four teenagers were seized by the military over an alleged theft when coming back from playing football.
Their mutilated, burned bodies were later found.
Sixteen soldiers have been detained and charged with the boys' ""forced disappearance"" and are under investigation for murder.
They deny this, saying they eventually let the boys go.
The bedroom of two of the boys - Ismael and Josué Arroyo – is typical of that of many teenagers: littered with clothes and football posters.
Their father, Luis, clutches their football boots with raw grief. It's like he cannot believe that his sons' feet won't fill them again.
""Ismael wanted to fulfil his dream to be a professional footballer. A dream taken away by these soldiers,"" he cries.
The only identifiable remains left of Ismael and Josué were a finger and a foot.
Luis's anger and upset at the soldiers is clear.
""It's not like they caught and executed four dogs. They took four children away. Then went home for dinner.""
""We want justice,"" he adds. ""Children continue to be taken by the military and the government does nothing.""
The anger the case has stirred may well lead some people to try and punish President Noboa at the ballot box.
Luisa González, the woman hoping to defeat Noboa, has demanded justice and government resignations over the boys' deaths.
Some voters argue that Noboa's policies are just not working.
A public transport worker in Durán, who didn't want to be named, says gangs are calling him to extort money even from within maximum-security prisons.
He describes how gang members force drivers to pay ""vacunas"" (Spanish for vaccines, the term used to refer to the daily extortion fees) to avoid attacks.
""There are colleagues who have already gone bankrupt. I haven't worked since they almost killed me,"" he tells me.
Other critics point to a poor economy, with particularly high youth unemployment making young people vulnerable to gang recruitment.
Slow responses to last year's drought also worsened hardships across the country, which relies on hydropower for 80% of its electricity, with power outages lasting up to 14 hours.
One of those affected was Christian Guerrero.
The 40-year-old, who lives in a poorer neighbourhood of Guayaquil, says the constant blackouts broke both his refrigerator and his TV.
He agrees with the opposition that there's ""no plan"" to prevent further outages.
The election comes about a year after President Noboa militarised the country through emergency decrees.
For Carlos and Laura Ipaneque it's also about a year since their son, Carlos Javier Vega, was killed.
He'd panicked at a checkpoint when he heard gunshots and drove off, instead of stopping, causing the military to shoot him dead.
His parents illustrate the lose-lose dilemma many Ecuadoreans feel.
They live in a gated street, their house surrounded by metal bars, terrified of gang violence.
""Crime continues, robberies continue, kidnappings continue, extortions continue,"" Laura explains.
But some now fear the crackdown too.
""I don't want other people to have the pain that we have,"" Laura says through tears.
For many voters, this election hinges on whether they see the problem as worse than the cure.",Latin America

BBC News in Geneva","Gang rule in Haiti has led to a staggering rise in sexual violence against children, the United Nations' children's organisation has warned.
The Caribbean island has been in the grip of violent gangs for several years who have been treating the population with unrelenting brutality, Unicef said.
Sexual violence against children has increased 1,000% since 2023, turning their bodies ""into battlegrounds"", spokesman James Elder said.
Unicef estimates 85% of the capital Port-au-Prince is under the control of gangs. More than one million children are living with the constant threat of violence.
Mr Elder gave an example of a 16-year-old girl who had left home to go shopping, and then was seized by armed men. She was beaten, drugged, and repeatedly raped.
She was held for around one month, he said, until the gang let her go when they realised her family had no money to pay a ransom. Kidnappings for extortion are common in Haiti.
She is now in a UN shelter with dozens of other girls receiving care.
Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.
More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone.
Haiti's transitional presidential council, the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order, appears to be in turmoil.
The council replaced the interim prime minister in November but has made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections.
Children are also being recruited by the gangs, sometimes forcibly, Unicef said.
The organisation has come across child gang members who are as young as eight.
The basics that Haitian children need for a normal childhood, even if they are still at home with their families, are virtually non-existent said Unicef. Schools and hospitals are barely functioning and tens of thousands of children are not in school.
Unicef has created mobile safe spaces in Haiti to try to support children, and to prevent sexual violence.
But last year, when it appealed for $221.4m (£177.8m) to fund its work in Haiti, it received just a quarter of that.
It's feared now that with the US freeze on foreign aid affecting humanitarian projects worldwide, Haiti's needs will be neglected again.",Latin America

BBC News","A canal in a suburb of Argentina's capital Buenos Aires turned bright red on Thursday, alarming local residents.
Pictures and videos show the intensely coloured water flowing into an estuary, the Rio de la Plata, which borders an ecological reserve.
Local media reports suggest the colour may have been caused by the dumping of textile dye, or by chemical waste from a nearby depot.
The Environment Ministry said in a statement that water samples had been taken from the Sarandí canal to determine the cause of the colour change.
By late afternoon the colour of the water had lost some of its intensity, the AFP news agency reported.
Residents have claimed that many local companies dispose of toxic waste in the waterway, which runs through an area of leather processing and textile factories some 10km (6 miles) from the centre of the capital.
A resident, a woman called Silvia, told local news channel C5N that although it is has turned red now, ""other times it was yellow, with an acidic smell that makes us sick even in the throat"".
""I live a block from the stream. Today, it has no smell. There are not many factories in the area, although there are warehouses.""
Another resident, Maria Ducomls, told AFP industries in the region dump waste in the water, and said she had seen it coloured differently in the past - ""bluish, a little green, pink, a little lilac, with grease on top"".",Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9149j4nmzo,Panama denies US claims over free canal passages,2025-02-06T11:45:16.616Z,"Malu Cursino
BBC News","Panama has denied making changes to allow US government vessels to transit the Panama Canal for free, following White House claims it had agreed to such a move.
The State Department said in a statement on X that its government vessels ""can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year"".
Responding to the comments, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) said it was ""empowered to set tolls and other fees for transiting the canal,"" adding that it had ""not made any adjustments to them"".
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to retake control of the waterway, which is key to global trade.
The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been on a visit to Latin American countries this week, demanded that Panama make ""immediate changes"" to what he calls the ""influence and control"" of China over the canal.
America's top diplomat said Panama had to act or the US would take necessary measures to protect its rights under a treaty between the two countries.
During a visit to the country, Rubio met Panama's President José Raúl Mulino, as well as the canal's administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales.
The ACP said after his visit that it had conveyed its intention to work with the US navy to optimise transit priority for its vessels through the canal.
This commitment for dialogue with Washington remained, it said in a separate statement on Wednesday.
US vessels make up a significant proportion of traffic in the canal. In 2024, 52% of transits through the waterway had ports of origin or destination in the United States, according to the canal's authorities.
Up to 14,000 ships use the canal each year to avoid a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America.
In his inaugural speech, President Trump said he planned to ""take back"" the canal, alleging that China was operating it and Panama had ""broken"" a promise to remain neutral.
The plan was strongly rejected by Mulino, who said the key trade route ""is and will remain"" in the country's hands.
He also rejected Trump's allegations about China's influence, saying there is ""no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration"".
Trump recently reiterated his claim. Despite saying earlier this week he was ""not happy"" with the situation, he acknowledged that Panama had ""agreed to certain things"". Mulino has said his country will not continue its membership in China's infrastructure-building programme, the Belt and Road Initiative.
The US built the canal in the early 20th Century but, after years of protest, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control of the waterway, which Trump has branded ""a big mistake"".",Latin America

Dominic Hughes
Health correspondent","The Argentine government led by Javier Milei has announced that it plans to pull out of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
A spokesman for President Milei said the decision to exit the WHO was triggered by ""deep differences regarding health management especially during the [Covid-19] pandemic"".
The announcement comes just over two weeks after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing from the international health body.
The two leaders have expressed admiration for each other, with Milei calling Trump's re-election the ""greatest political comeback in history"", while the US president described his Argentine counterpart as ""my favourite president"".
The decision by President Milei to withdraw his country from the WHO follows the same arguments that underpinned the withdrawal of the United States.
Both cited the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw a long lockdown imposed in Argentina, as well as concerns over Chinese influence over the global health body.
The difference is the impact this is likely to have on the WHO itself.
The USA is by far the biggest individual contributor to the UN body, putting in around $950m (£760m) in 2024, nearly 15% of the total budget. The US withdrawal will pose some difficult financial questions.
Argentina on the other hand contributes roughly $8m a year. That is unlikely to make any significant material difference.
The bigger question is whether other leaders who share President Trump's world view, as President Milei clearly does, decide to take similar action.
If more states pull out – and that is admittedly a big if - the credibility of the WHO as the one truly global health body could take a hit.
Argentine media say they expect President Milei to sign an executive order in the coming days which will begin the process of Argentina pulling out from the WHO.
Speaking at a news conference, presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said that ""we Argentines are not going to allow an international body to interfere with our sovereignty, and even less with our health"".
The spokesman argued that an exit from the WHO would provide Argentina with more flexibility to implement policies tailored to its own interests and to administer its funds as it saw fit.
President Milei, who describes himself as an ""anarcho-capitalist"", has been critical of the WHO for some time but the idea of leaving the body appears to have gained traction in the days after Donald Trump signed an executive order setting in motion the US's exit from the international body.
The two heads of state appear to share mutual admiration for each other.
Javier Milei was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his election victory on 5 November.
Speaking at a gala at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on the night of their meeting, Milei said that ""the winds of freedom [were] blowing much stronger since Trump's victory"".
Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether President Milei was planning to withdraw from other international bodies or treaties, the presidential spokesman refused to rule out anything.
""The president is very determined when it comes to making Argentina freer, so any link that Argentina has with bodies that go against its freedoms, we're going to do our utmost to prevent them from interfering in the lives of Argentines.""
Environmental activists in Argentina say they fear that Milei will follow in Trump's footsteps and also set the wheels in motion to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement - the international treaty which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4jx8xyjgo,Could US criminals be sent to El Salvador's mega-jail?,2025-02-04T21:25:49.569Z,"Vanessa Buschschlüter
Latin America editor, BBC News Online","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could not have been more complimentary about the deal he struck with the president of El Salvador on Monday.
The Trump administration's top diplomat appeared delighted yet stunned by the fact that President Nayib Bukele should have ""agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world"".
Bukele had offered to take in people deported from the US, regardless of their nationality, and house them in El Salvador's mega-jail.
""We can send them and he will put them in his jails,"" Rubio said.
While that was already a win for President Donald Trump, whose priority has been to speed up the removal of undocumented migrants from the US, the real surprise came in the part of the deal Rubio mentioned next.
""He [Bukele] has also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're US citizens or legal residents,"" Rubio said.
The Salvadorean leader confirmed that he had ""offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system"".
He clarified that El Salvador would be ""willing to take in only convicted criminals"" and that his government would do so ""in exchange for a fee"".
Bukele also revealed where he would house those deported from the US: ""our mega-prison"".
The mega-jail, also known as Cecot (short for Terrorism Confinement Centre), has become emblematic of Bukele's iron-fist approach to crime and punishment.
The maximum-security prison, one of the largest in Latin America, opened in January 2023 and can house 40,000 inmates, according to government figures.
Inmates are confined to windowless cells, sleep on bare metal bunks and are constantly monitored by armed guards - some of whom watch over them from atop the lattice ceiling.
BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who was allowed to take an official tour of the facility last year after the BBC had repeatedly asked for access, described how temperatures in the cells would reach 35C.
Take a look at graphics and maps of the mega-jail
With access to the prison severely restricted and journalists only allowed on occasional and carefully choreographed official tours, the number of inmates per cell is not clear.
Some rights groups put it at 80 prisoners while others say it can go up to more than 150.
Asked by our journalist what the maximum capacity was, the prison's director responded ""where you can fit 10 people, you can fit 20"".
Prisoners are locked up inside their cells 24 hours a day - except for 30 minutes of group exercise in a windowless corridor.
The layout of the jail is no coincidence.
Following a particularly bloody weekend in 2022, when more than 70 people were killed in the small Central American nation, President Bukele wrote on social media: ""Message for the gangs: because of your actions, your 'homeboys' will not be able to see a ray of sunshine.""
Building of the Cecot mega-jail started shortly afterwards.
Conditions at the facility and the treatment of inmates has come under severe criticism from human rights groups.
Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, has described it as a ""concrete and steel pit"".
So could the Trump administration send US citizens there?
On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he would embrace the idea but questioned its legality.
""If we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he said during an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office. ""I don't know if we do or not.
""We're looking at that right now, but we could make deals where we'd get these animals out of our country.""
But any attempt to deport US citizens or people lawfully resident in the US to a foreign jail is bound to face legal challenges.
US citizens who were born in the United States enjoy legal protection from deportation.
There are some cases, however, in which naturalised citizens - those who were not born in the US and who obtained US citizenship after birth through a legal process - can have their citizenship revoked.
This tends to occur when the person in question used fraud to obtain the citizenship in the first place.
Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that naturalised US citizens suspected of ties to criminal gangs or terrorist organisations - such as the Tren de Aragua criminal gang or the Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13 - could also, in theory, be stripped of US citizenship.
""If they find out you were a member of any group that persecuted or threatened to persecute others, they can try to denaturalise you,"" Mr Cuic added.
""So, if you had gang ties and never disclosed them, they could use that as a reason to denaturalise you.""
Once a person has been ""denaturalised"", they are at risk of deportation.
Mr Cuic pointed out that any such move would have to be preceded by a ""formal court process"" conducted in a federal court.
But the lawyer warned that ""citizenship is not something that is definitively forever if you are naturalised"".
He stressed, though, that he had ""never heard"" of cases of natural-born US citizens being sent abroad for imprisonment for crimes committed and prosecuted in the US.
Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, similarly said that she had ""never heard of such a suggestion"" as sending American citizens to serve US prison sentences overseas.
While she acknowledged that there were various scenarios in which naturalised US citizens could lose their citizenship, she said that ""you can't denaturalise a natural-born citizen"".
The status of lawful permanent residents in the US, however, is more precarious than that of US citizens.
They can be deported if they violate certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include committing drug offences, violent crimes or crimes such as theft, fraud or assault.
Like naturalised citizens, they can also be deported if they obtained their residency through fraud.
Permanent lawful residents who are involved in terrorism, espionage or any activity threatening US national interest could also be deported.
This last point is important in light of the executive order President Trump issued on his inauguration day in which he designated drug cartels as ""foreign terrorist organisations"".
Two criminal organisations named in the executive order, Tren de Aragua and MS-13, were also mentioned last week by Trump's special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone.
Speaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Claver-Carone not only praised Bukele's handling of the MS-13 - a gang which is deeply rooted in El Salvador and has long terrorised its citizens - but also said that Bukele could offer the answer on how to deal with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
Claver-Carone also appeared to argue that the mere prospect of being sent to a Salvadoran jail could drive Venezuelan gang members back to their homeland.
""I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador,"" he said of members of the Tren de Aragua gang.
Rubio, too, seemed to stress that the Trump administration would first and foremost want to send members of these two notorious gangs to El Salvador's prisons.
""Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal - MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be - he has offered his jails,"" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele.
While it is by no means clear who - if anyone - will be sent from the US to El Salvador's mega-prison, what is certain is that with his ""unprecedented offer of friendship"", Bukele has landed firmly in Trump's favour at a time when relations between the US and its neighbours have been rocked by the US president's threats to impose tariffs on their goods.

Reporter, Port of Spain","For Margaret Charles, the new year started just as the old one ended, days filled with grief and no end to a mother's worst nightmare, after her son's life was snatched away in a brutal murder.
Sitting on the porch of her home located in Moruga, a rural town in south Trinidad, Margaret ran through a range of emotions as she spoke about her son, Shakeem Charles, who was killed last July.
""I'm being faced with it every day,"" Margaret told the BBC.
""There's a letter that Amarah wrote to her father for Christmas, and when we sat down for lunch, she said: 'Nobody is to sit on that chair, that chair is for daddy.'""
Shakeem's two children, Amarah, seven, and Amare, three, now spend a lot more time with their grandparents.
Their 32-year-old father was just one of the many murder victims in Trinidad and Tobago in 2024, which was the Caribbean nation's deadliest year on record with 624 homicides, according to data from local police.
Shakeem was an Information Technology technician, but his family said that shortly before he was killed, he had started working with a local ride-hailing company to earn extra money.
Margaret said her son went missing on 9 July after taking a job to drop off a passenger in another southern town.
The ride-hailing company said Shakeem's only trip that day ended at around 17:25 local time.
That night, calls to his mobile phone went unanswered. However, his family got a notification for an ATM cash withdrawal from a joint bank account.
The following day, through GPS tracking, his car was found abandoned more than 80km (50 miles) away in north-east Trinidad.
Margaret recalls how, after four days of searching, Shakeem's body was discovered in the same southern town where he was hired to drop the passenger. An autopsy determined he died from multiple gunshot wounds.
Police are yet to charge anyone in connection with the killing.
With murders soaring, Trinidad and Tobago's government declared a state of emergency on 30 December. It was originally due to last 15 days, but as it was about to run out, parliament voted to extend it for a further three months until mid-April.
Authorities blamed gang warfare for six murders over the two preceding days, while government officials said concern about reprisal killings prompted the state of emergency.
Five of those six killings happened in one shooting incident on 29 December, in Laventille, an area just outside the capital, Port of Spain.
Some residents say crime has become part of the culture in Laventille.
Joeth Roberts says that what stopped him from joining a gang when the opportunity arose was his upbringing.
""I was approached by a person who was looking for underlings, someone to run the block,"" Joeth recalls.
""He offered me a firearm and other stuff, but that wasn't in me,"" Joeth says, thanking his parents for the way they brought him up.
Shaquille Gaskin, who also lives in Laventille, told the BBC that he knew a few people ""who are very excited to do the wrong things"".
Shaquille is a musician who plays the steelpan. He says he remains firmly on the right side of the law, but that there are others in the neighbourhood who are drawn to crime.
""That's because that's what they know, they grow up seeing that, seeing the older ones doing that, so they automatically go into that.""
The musician is convinced that there are lots of opportunities for people in so-called ""crime hot spots"" to be law-abiding citizens, but he thinks the government and others offering those opportunities should engage with at-risk communities more actively.
He argues that in order to get young people on board, a consistent effort has to be made to get them to stay on the right path rather than be tempted by gang leaders' offers.
It is an opinion echoed by Dr Malisa Neptune-Figaro.
The criminologist at the University of the West Indies says that her research suggests that gangs started becoming more prevalent in Trinidad and Tobago at the beginning of this millennium.
Dr Neptune-Figaro has also found that many offenders were victims themselves at some point.
""You have to look at how they feel as persons. If you feel despondent and you don't feel like you belong in our contemporary society and mainstream society, you're going to have this parallel society, where you feel like you belong,"" she says.
""You have to talk about what the gangs do for them as well, [why] they feel at home.""
The state of emergency gives law enforcement officers extra powers to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants.
Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds said the state of emergency had already led to a reduction in murders, shootings, robberies and car thefts.
Police say they have arrested over 650 people.
However, Dr Malisa Neptune-Figaro warns that this crime-fighting tool may only work in the short term.
The criminologist at the University of the West Indies argues that long term, there should be a focus on refurbishing and revamping the criminal justice system.
But she says that there has to be a wider approach too, incorporating ""different elements of society, our education system, finding jobs for persons who are unemployed, giving them alternative measures to crime, better parenting styles"".
For Margaret Charles, the extension of the state of emergency has raised her hope that the police will catch whoever killed her son and bring them to justice.
""Not only Shakeem's case, but in any case, that people who they suspect and for some reason or the other they couldn't hold them and question them or probably search, that something happens,"" she says.",Latin America

BBC News & BBC Monitoring, Miami","More than 32,000 people have fled the northern Colombian region of Catatumbo where two rival rebel groups are engaged in a bloody battle.
At least 80 people have been killed over recent days amid the surge in fighting between rebels from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).
One official government agency said it had received reports of ELN rebels going house-to-house and killing those suspected of ties with rival groups.
The government has declared a state of emergency and the first of a planned deployment of 5,000 soldiers have arrived in the area.
President Gustavo Petro said on Tuesday that the state ""had failed"" to contain the violence but that it would learn from that failure.
His government has reactivated arrest warrants for 31 top commanders of the ELN, which had been suspended while the rebel group held peace talks with the government.
Last week, President Petro suspended the talks for a second time in less than a year due to the violence in Catatumbo.
The fighting has been so fierce that 32,000 people have fled their homes, according to figures provided by the Ombudsman's office on Tuesday.
Many have sought refuge in schools and sports stadiums which have been converted into impromptu shelters.
Investigative news programme Noticias Uno said it had seen a military intelligence report which suggested that the surge in violence between the two rival groups had been triggered by ""the loss of a multi-million-dollar cocaine shipment in November 2024"".
According to the report, a member of the Farc dissident group known as Frente 33 came to an agreement with their rivals from the ELN to ""not interfere"" with each other's cocaine production and shipments.
Both the ELN and the remnants of the Farc rebel group which remained active after the main guerrilla group signed a peace agreement in 2016 are heavily involved in the drugs trade.
The pact between the two groups seems to have broken down over the ""lost"" cocaine shipment, the intelligence report suggests.
Although it is not clear which ""lost"" stash the report is referring to, Colombian media have pointed out that in December last year counter-narcotics agents in the Dominican Republic seized 9.5 tonnes of cocaine which they said had originated in Catatumbo.
The mountainous region, on Colombia's north-eastern border with Venezuela, is a hotspot for cocaine production and trafficking.
President Petro, who was a member of a left-wing rebel group in his youth, said this week that ""what happened in Catatumbo is yet another example of a shift from insurgent guerrillas to narco-armed organisations"".
He also referred to the ELN as a ""mafia"".
Petro campaigned on a promise to bring ""total peace"" to Colombia but last week he said that ""the ELN has no will for peace"".",Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2egwzvp080o,Panama rejects Trump vow to 'take back' Panama Canal,2025-01-20T22:44:32.037Z,"Dearbail Jordan
Business reporter, BBC News","Panama's president has rejected a plan by Donald Trump to ""take back"" the Panama Canal, telling his US counterpart the key trade route ""is and will remain"" in the country's hands.
In his inaugural speech, President Trump claimed that Panama had ""broken"" a promise to remain neutral, alleging that ""China is operating the Panama Canal"".
President Jose Raul Mulino said he rejected Trump's words in their ""entirety"", adding there is ""no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration"".
The Panama Canal is one of the US's most important trade routes, with about 40% of all the country's container ships passing through the waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
In the first address of his second term, Trump claimed: ""American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form and that includes the United States Navy.
""And above all China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.""
The US built the canal in the early 20th century but, after years of protest, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control of the waterway, which Trump has branded ""a big mistake"".
In 1999, Panama took full control of the canal with a treaty in place that it remain neutral and open to vessels of all nations.
Following Trump's address, Mulino said in a social media post on X: ""The canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999.""
Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa operates two ports on the waterway - the Port of Balboa on the Pacific side of the route while Cristobal operates on the Atlantic end.
Around 5% of global maritime trade passes through the 51-mile Panama Canal.
Last week, Marco Rubio, Trump's nominee for secretary of state, told a senate confirmation hearing ""the very legitimate concern is these companies control both ends of this canal and at a time of conflict and the Chinese tell them 'shut it down and don't let the US go through there' we got a big, big problem. A big economic problem and a big national security and defence problem"".
In his speech, Trump said that he wanted to be a ""peacemaker"" but Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia under President Obama wrote on social media: ""You can't be a president of peace and take back the Panama Canal.""
As well as the Panama Canal, Trump has previously also said he wanted to acquire Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory. Denmark rejected any suggestion they would give it up.
Trump did not mention Greenland in his address but he set out his expansionist vision for the next four years.
""The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,"" he said.",Latin America

BBC News","The death toll from attacks by a rebel group in Colombia's Catatumbo region has risen to 60, the country's human rights office has said.
Rival factions have been vying for control of the cocaine trade in the region - which sits near the border with Venezuela - for years.
The Ombudsman's Office said the latest violence involved the National Liberation Army (ELN) - the largest armed group still active in Colombia - and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which signed a peace treaty with the state in 2016.
The attacks broke an uneasy truce between the guerrilla groups, which had been in peace negotiations with the government.
The Ombudsman's Office, a government agency that oversees the protection of citizens' human and civil rights, previously reported that 40 had died in the violence.
It said that many people, including community leaders and their families, were facing a ""special risk"" of being kidnapped or killed at the hands of the ELN. It noted that 20 people had recently been kidnapped, half of whom were women.
The office said that among those killed were seven peace treaty signatories and Carmelo Guerrero, the leader of the Association for Peasant Unity in Catatumbo (Asuncat), a local advocacy group.
Asuncat wrote on social media on Friday that Roger Quintero and Freiman Velasquez, members of its board of directors, had not been seen since the previous day, and that it suspected armed groups had taken them.
""In some communities in the region, food shortages are beginning to be reported, affecting local communities,"" the Ombudsman's Office wrote in a statement on Saturday, adding that thousands of people are believed to have been displaced by the violence.
""Elderly people, children, adolescents, pregnant women and people with disabilities are suffering the consequences of these events.""
""Catatumbo is once again stained with blood,"" the Association of Mothers of Catatumbo for Peace wrote on Friday.
""The bullets exchanged not only hurt those who hold the weapons, but also tear apart the dreams of our communities, break up families and sow terror in the hears of our children.""
The Ombudsman's Office appeared to lay the blame for the latest violence on the ELN, which had been in peace talks with the Colombian government until they were suspended on Friday due to the violence in Catatumbo.
President Gustavo Petro - who since his election in 2022 has sought to end violence between armed groups in the country - accused the ELN of ""war crimes"" and said the group ""shows no willingness to make peace"".
The ELN accused Farc of having initiated the conflict by killing civilians in a statement on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. Farc has not publicly responded to the allegation.

BBC News","A statue of the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro has been reinstalled in the centre of Lima, the capital of Peru, more than 20 years after it had been removed.
The sculpture was unveiled during a ceremony marking the 490th anniversary of the city's founding.
Pizarro founded Lima in 1535 after defeating the Inca Empire and claiming their lands for the Spanish crown.
Indigenous leaders say he was a mass murderer who destroyed their culture, while those who supported the statue's return said Peru should not erase its history.
The monument, which shows Pizarro on horseback with his sword drawn, was created by the American sculptor Charles Rumsey and offered by his widow to commemorate the city's fourth centenary in 1935.
In 2003, it was moved to a park next to train tracks outside the city centre following calls for its removal.
Luis Bogdanovich, who was in charge of restoring the historic centre, told local media the statue had become damaged by the constant passing of trains, which caused it to crack.
Rafael López Aliaga, Lima's mayor, and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, president of the Community of Madrid, presented the bronze statue on Saturday alongside Mr Bogdanovich and several descendants of Pizarro in Lima's main square, Plaza de Armas.
Díaz Ayuso said the ceremony was commemorating ""not only the birth of a city, but also the beginning of a historic encounter that forever transformed the world"", the Spanish daily El Pais reported.
Dozens of Peruvians held a demonstration nearby opposing its return, according to the AFP news agency.

Jose Daniel Ferrer spent more than three years in prison following anti-government protests that swept through the Communist-run island in 2021.
Under the agreement brokered by the Catholic Church, outgoing US President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism just days before the end of his term.
In return, Cuba said it would free 553 people, many of whom were detained during the anti-government protests.
The island began releasing the first of hundreds of prisoners on Wednesday, freeing about 20 people, according to local NGOs.
Ferrer is one of the most recognised names among Cuban dissidents and pro-democracy activists. The 54-year-old leader of Cuba's Patriotic Union (Unpacu), an opposition group in the country, was jailed and charged with public disorder following the 2021 protests.
""I am at home, in fair health, but with the courage to continue fighting for the freedom of Cuba,"" Ferrer told Reuters in a phone conversation.
Many of the prisoners released this week were arrested in association with 2021 protests, during which citizens demanded that the Cuban government do more to ease widespread food shortages and lower spiralling prices.
Biden's move to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism came just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, has been critical of the decision to ease sanctions on Cuba, hinting that it could be reversed.
Speaking at his Senate nomination hearing on Wednesday, Rubio said referring to some of the sanctions on Cuba that the Biden administration rescinded on Tuesday that ""the new administration is not bound by that decision"".
Earlier, Trump's choice for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Fox News that ""anything [the Biden administration] are doing right now, we can do back, and no-one should be under any illusion in terms of a change in Cuba policy"".

In a video she posted on social media, Ms Pérez Paseiro said that the Cuban government had used her and her fellow prisoners as ""a bargaining chip"" to leverage Cuba's removal from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.
In the recording, she also said she would continue to ""fight for Cuba's freedom"".
Dariel Cruz García was also among those who were freed on Wednesday.
The 23-year-old had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for sedition after joining in the 2021 protests.
He told Reuters that officials had announced that he could serve the remainder of his sentence - which has been reduced since he was originally sentenced - at home.
""I escaped from hell to be with my family. I'll behave myself so I can move on,"" he told the news agency.
The vice-president of Cuba's highest court, Maricela Sosa, said on TV that those freed had neither received an amnesty nor had they been pardoned and warned that they could be re-arrested if they broke the terms of their parole.

BBC News","The number of people internally displaced by gang violence in Haiti has tripled to more than one million, the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM) warned on Tuesday.
The situation is particularly dire in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where displacement has risen by 87% between 2023 and 2024, IOM figures show.
Gangs control almost the entire city, leading to the collapse of the remaining health services and triggering food insecurity.
More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone.
IOM Spokesman Kennedy Okoth Omondi said many of the more than one million displaced people had had to flee multiple times as the gangs expanded their territory in Port-au-Prince.
An estimated 85% of the capital is now estimated to be under gang control.
Most of those displaced fled Port-au-Prince for rural areas, where resources are limited, the IOM warned.
Its Director-General, Amy Pope, said that Haiti needed ""sustained humanitarian assistance right now to save and protect lives"".
Half of those displaced are children, according to the IOM's figures.
The agency described how families were ""struggling to survive in makeshift shelters while facing mounting health and protection risks"".
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse.
A UN-backed multinational security force arrived in Haiti in June to try and re-establish control but has so far made few inroads into gang-held territory.
The international police force, which is meant to bolster the Haitian National Police force, is underfunded and lacks the necessary equipment to take on the heavily armed gangs.

Landslides following torrential rains are not uncommon in the rainy season, with neighbourhoods precariously built on steep hillsides the worst hit.

Documentary photographer, Guatemala City","""It all started as a small passion project,"" says Fabriccio Díaz, 28, who, together with his wife Lucía Ramírez, 25, runs the only fully operational photo film development lab in Central America from their apartment in Guatemala City.
""Now we have over 60 clients a month and have developed over 800 rolls just this year,"" he adds.
Arca Film Lab has been in high demand this year and is the only photo film development lab in Central America that develops every type of analogue photography film, which includes the rather complicated process of developing positives in a process known as E-6.
Fabriccio, who studied cinematography, explains that the great inaccessibility of high-quality film development services in Central America gave him the first decisive push to learn how to develop his first film.
""When we started experimenting and developing film in our apartment, friends started asking us to develop film for them and it all just took off somehow,"" Lucía recalls.
And so, the Arca Film Lab was born in September 2023 as a simple Instagram page offering film development services in Guatemala.
The couple have taught themselves most of the skills needed to develop film by watching YouTube videos and by reaching out to other film labs internationally and asking for tips.
""We were surprised that so many people responded to our questions. A lot of the veterans in the photo development world helped us out by sharing their experiences and tricks. We are really grateful for that,"" says Fabriccio.
Fabriccio and Lucía's love of photography is not confined to developing film, though. The couple also organise ""photo walks"" in which a group of people get together in Antigua, the old centre of Guatemala City, to take pictures and experiment with old analogue cameras.
For young analogue photography enthusiasts like Iván Ortiz, 22, snapping photos with a camera which is older than he is gives him something modern cameras cannot compete with.
""It's like having nostalgia for a generation we were never a part of,"" he tells the BBC.
Iván says that older people do not always get the recent hype for old cameras and film. ""They just don't understand our perspective,"" he explains.
""We live in a world where everything is digital and fast. Through analogue photography, I have to make conscious decisions about my photos and focus solely on the act of photographing. And the best part of it is that you have something physical afterwards, and not just another data file,"" he adds.
Having physical photos to hold is also something that Steven López from the US highlights as an advantage of analogue photography.
The 33-year-old is travelling through Central America to document the last traces of Mayan culture and always carries a 35mm analogue camera with him.
""Photography and especially analogue photography is just the best way to document and experience cultures. Every time I get back from travelling and get the developed film back it's like Christmas!"", he tells the BBC.
The community of analogue photography enthusiasts in Central America may be growing quickly, but the challenges are greater than in other places.
""It is really hard to get analogue cameras here and it is even harder to get them in good condition,"" explains 26-year-old Ronald Ottoniel, who went on the photo walk to buy new rolls of film and turn in others to be developed.
And there are other hurdles, too.
Fabriccio and Lucía explain that the process of buying and importing the chemicals needed to develop positive film has been extremely complicated because the import of these chemicals is closely monitored by the state and requires special permits, which has made it a painstakingly long ordeal.
""Many other labs don't offer the E-6 processing just because it's so complicated to import the chemicals,"" says Fabriccio.
Their business may be expanding, but Fabriccio and Lucía are determined to make sure it does not lose the personal touch and passion which inspired it in the first place.
Lucía explains how sometimes clients ""put little sweets into the packages they send us and sometimes we send a handwritten note back"".
""It's important to us that this is not a mass-producing business, but that every client is [treated as] an individual,"" she adds.
Around the world, photo labs use large machines that develop the film almost completely automatically, but in the humble apartment of Fabriccio and Lucía, the process is very much ""hands-on"".
For colour and positive (E-6) film the temperature of the chemicals and the time the film is exposed to them has to be exact, otherwise, the entire film roll will turn out badly.
""The beginning was definitely not easy with this entire process, but after developing over 800 film rolls these processes come like second nature to us,"" recalls Fabriccio.
""But the first time we developed the positive films, the E-6 process, we were so nervous because we had invested so much in the chemicals and the roll. But when it came out well and we were able to see these lively colours of the positive film it's always very exciting,"" he adds.
Another indispensable member of the Arca Film Lab is Toto, the four-month-old cat that is, according to Fabriccio and Lucía, in charge of quality control and roves around during the entire development process.
The developed film rolls are then transferred from the kitchen to the bathroom, as it is the most dust-free space in the house.
There they dry, to be later scanned in a high-resolution Nikon scanner, which Fabriccio says is the highest-resolution film scanner in Central America.
Fabriccio and Lucía have now also expanded to El Salvador, where they regularly collect and sell film rolls.
The young couple remains ambitious and in the future, they say they hope to establish a strong relationship with CineStill and Eastman Kodak andto expand to developing cine film rolls, which would include a complicated process known as ECN-2.
""It is my dream to revitalise the classical cinematography scene here in Central America! We have so much talent expertise and enthusiasm to offer the world. (...) with Arca Film Lab we have started a movement that we want to push further and further,"" says Fabriccio.

BBC News
Ione Wells
South America correspondent","The US has announced an increased $25m (£20.4m) reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on the day he was sworn in for a third six-year term in office.
The inauguration ceremony was overshadowed by recrimination from the international community and Venezuelan opposition leaders.
Rewards have also been offered for information leading to the arrest and or conviction of Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. A new reward of up to $15m for Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino has also been offered.
The UK also issued sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials, including judges, members of the security forces and military officials.
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said those sanctioned were responsible for ""undermining democracy, the rule of law, and human rights violations"".
Foreign Secretary David Lammy went on to describe Maduro's regime as ""fraudulent"".
Also on Friday, the EU said it was extending ""restrictive measures"" against Venezuela because of ""the lack of progress... leading to the restoration of democracy and the rule of law"". The bloc also sanctioned a further 15 Venezuelan officials.
Canada also imposed fresh sanctions in what Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly called Maduro's ""shameless actions"".
Joly said Canada ""will not tolerate the erosion of the democratic process or the repression of citizens seeking to express their rights"".
Maduro and his government have repeatedly denounced many of the allegations made by Western countries and opposition leaders.
The reward from the US cites narcotics and corruption charges dating back to 2020.
In 2020, the US charged Maduro, and other senior officials in the country with ""narco-terrorism"".
It accused them of flooding the US with cocaine and using drugs as a weapon to undermine the health of Americans.
Maduro has rejected the accusations. The US also re-imposed oil sanctions last year, after temporarily easing them in the hope Maduro could be incentivised to hold free and fair elections.
The Venezuelan president has blamed an economic collapse in his country on US-led sanctions he calls illegitimate and imperial. His critics blame corruption and economic mismanagement.
On Friday, President Maduro took the oath of office, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a ""period of peace"".
""This new presidential term will be the period of peace, prosperity, equality, and the new democracy,"" he said.
""I swear by history, I swear by my life, and I will fulfil it,"" he added.
The 28 July election results were widely rejected by the international community, including by Brazil and Colombia, some of Venezuela's left-wing neighbours.
The inauguration itself was a tightly controlled affair. Most accredited Venezuelan media were not allowed inside and foreign journalists were not allowed in the country.
Maduro has a few allies remaining including Iran, China and Russia but is increasingly isolated on the world stage.
The Cuban and Nicaraguan presidents were the only leaders present at the inauguration.
The 62-year-old was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised the exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.
González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support.
The Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his detention.
On Friday, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the release of all who have been ""arbitrarily detained"" since the elections.

President Maduro took the oath of office before parliament on Friday, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a ""period of peace"".
The official results of July's election have been widely rejected by the international community, including neighbours Brazil and Colombia.
The 62-year-old's inauguration comes one day after Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado was briefly arrested and then freed after addressing a protest rally.
Information Minister Freddy Nanez dismissed the reports of Machado's detention as a ""media distraction"" after her team said she was ""violently intercepted"" in eastern Caracas.
In a speech during his inauguration, Maduro said: ""I swear that this new presidential term will be one of peace, prosperity, equality and new democracy. I swear it by history, I swear it on my life. I will keep my word.""
Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by the official electoral commission. The opposition and many countries, including the US, had rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.
González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support.
The Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 (£81,755) reward for information leading to his detention.
It comes as Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), which is closely aligned with the government.
Machado, whom González replaced on the ballot after she was barred from running herself, has also been targeted. She went into hiding soon after the disputed elections, and was last seen in public in August before Thursday's rally.
Also on Thursday, the United Nations expressed its alarm after it received reports of arbitrary detentions and intimidation in Venezuela ahead of the opposition marches.
It highlighted the arrest of Carlos Correa, the head of an NGO promoting press freedom, who was seized by unidentified hooded men earlier in the week.",Latin America

BBC News","Venezuela's opposition says its leader María Corina Machado was briefly arrested and then freed after addressing a protest rally on the eve of President Nicolás Maduro's disputed inauguration.
Machado, 57, was ""violently intercepted"" in eastern Caracas and the motorcycle convoy in which she was riding was shot at, the opposition said, adding that she was forced to record several videos while being held.
Venezuela's information minister Freddy Nanez dismissed reports of Machado's detention as a ""media distraction"".
Maduro, 62, was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, reject the result as fraudulent, and recognise the now-exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.

Maduro's government has deployed thousands of police officers in Caracas, where the government-allied National Assembly plans to swear Maduro in for a third term in office.
The opposition for its part urged its supporters to turn out in droves in an effort to thwart the ceremony.
In the city of Valencia, police fired tear gas at protesters, according to Reuters.
In western Caracas, 70-year-old Niegalos Payares told the news agency that ""I'm not afraid, I lost my fear a long time ago"".
And in the city of Maracay, in central Venezuela, Roisa Gómez told a Reuters reporter that she was ""fighting for my vote, which I cast for Edmundo González. They cannot steal the election.""
Maduro was declared the winner of the presidential election by the government-dominated National Electoral Council (CNE) but the CNE has to this day failed to provide detailed voting data to back up this claim.
Earlier this month in Washington, González met US President Joe Biden, who said that Venezuela deserved a ""peaceful transfer of power"".
In Panama, González deposited thousands of voting tallies which the opposition collected in the country's bank for safekeeping.
The tallies have been the key evidence offered by the opposition to show that González, not Maduro won the election.

BBC News Mundo","""They have already tortured me and repressed me, but they will not silence me. My voice is the only thing I have left.""
This is how Juan, a young man aged around 20, begins his story. He alleges he was physically and psychologically tortured by Venezuelan security forces after being detained in connection with the presidential elections on 28 July.
He was one of many hundreds of people arrested during protests after the electoral authorities - which are dominated by government loyalists - announced that the incumbent, Nicolás Maduro, had won.
The National Electoral Council (CNE) did not make the voting tallies public and the Venezuelan opposition has described the official result as fraudulent, pointing out that the voting tallies it got hold of with the help of election observers suggest an overwhelming victory for its candidate, Edmundo González.
Juan was released from prison in mid-November, days after Maduro called on judicial authorities to ""rectify"" any injustices in the arrests.
The BBC spoke to him via video call. For his own safety, we have decided to withhold some of the details of his case and have changed his name.
The young man alleges that many of the detainees are mistreated, given ""rotten food"" and that the most rebellious are locked up in ""torture chambers"".
He showed the BBC documents and evidence that corroborate his story, which coincides with other testimony and with the complaints of non-governmental organisations.
Juan, an anti-government political activist, says the election campaign and the days leading up to the election were ""marked by hope"" and many people were keen to vote for change.
But the announcement of Maduro's victory shortly after midnight that Sunday turned what for many was a celebratory mood into confusion and anger.
Thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets to protest against a result they decried as fraudulent.
The opposition and international organisations say what followed was police repression which caused the deaths of more than 20 protesters.
Maduro and some of his officials in turn have blamed the opposition, the ""extreme right"" and ""terrorist"" groups for the deaths.
Gonzalo Himiob of Venezuelan non-governmental organisation Foro Penal says people were arrested for as little as ""celebrating the opposition's declaration of Edmundo González as the winner, or for posting something on social media"".
""We also have cases of people who were not even protesting, but for some reason they were near a protest and they were arrested,"" he added.
Juan says that is what happened to him.
The young political activist says he had been running an errand when a group of hooded men intercepted him, covered his face and beat him, accusing him of being a terrorist.
""They planted Molotov cocktails and petrol on me, and then took me to a detention centre,"" he continued.
He was held in a prison in the interior of Venezuela for several weeks until he was transferred to Tocorón, a notorious high-security prison about 140km south-west of the capital, Caracas.
There he would go through what he describes as the worst experience of his life.
""When we arrived at Tocorón, they stripped us, beat us, and insulted us. We were forbidden to raise our heads and look at the guards; we had to lower our heads to the floor,"" Juan recounts.
Juan was assigned a small cell measuring three metres by three metres, which he had to share with five other people.
There were six beds arranged in three bunk beds, and in one corner there was a septic tank and ""a pipe that served as a shower"". That was the bathroom.
""In Tocorón I felt more like I was in a concentration camp than in a prison,"" says the young man. He describes the beds as ""concrete tombs"" with a very thin mattress.
""They tortured us physically and psychologically. They wouldn't let us sleep, they were always coming to ask us to get up and line up,"" he explains.
""They would wake us up around 05:00 to line up behind the cell. The guards would ask us to show our passes and numbers.""
He adds that at around 06:00 they would turn on the water for six minutes so they could bathe.
""Six minutes for six people and just one shower, with very cold water. If you were the last one there and you didn't have time to take off the soap, you were left covered in soap for the rest of the day,"" he says.
Then, he adds, they waited for breakfast, which sometimes arrived at 06:00 and other times at 12:00.
Dinner was sometimes at 21:00, and sometimes at 02:00.
""Apart from waiting for meals, there was nothing else to do. We could only walk around inside the small cell and tell stories. We also talked about politics, but in low voices, because if the guards heard us, they would punish us.""
Juan says that many of his fellow inmates were depressed and acted like zombies.
""They gave us rotten food – meat scraps like you would give to chickens or dogs or sardines that had already expired.""
Some detainees were routinely beaten or made to ""walk like frogs"" with their hands on their ankles, he says.
He describes ""punishment cells"" where those considered the most rebellious would be sent, or those who dared to talk about politics or ask to make a phone call to relatives.
Juan says that he had been in one of the punishment cells in Tocorón, and that he had only received one meal every two days.
""It's a very dark cell, one metre by one metre. I was very hungry. What kept me going was thinking about all the injustices that were happening and that one day I would get out of there,"" he says.
Another torture cell is known as ""Adolfo's bed"", Juan says, named after the first person who died there.
""It's a dark, oxygen-deprived room the size of a vault. They put you in there for a few minutes until you can't breathe and you faint or start banging on the door in desperation. They put me in there and I lasted just over five minutes. I thought I was going to die,"" he recalls.
The young man says that in this prison, inmates have 10 minutes to exercise outside three times a week, but many just stay in their cells.
Foro Penal's Gonzalo Himiob describes the conditions in Tocorón as ""deplorable"" and says that detainees' fundamental rights, such as having access to a lawyer of the detainee's choosing, are being violated.
""They all have public defenders - the government knows that if it allows access to a private attorney who is not a public official, he or she can document all the due process violations that are occurring.""
In October, United Nations (UN) experts reported serious human rights violations committed in the run-up to the presidential election and during the protests that followed, including political persecution, excessive use of force, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions by state security forces and related civilian groups.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) is currently investigating the Venezuelan government for possible crimes against humanity.
The Venezuelan government denies the accusations and says this investigation ""responds to the intention of instrumentalising the mechanisms of international criminal justice for political purposes"".
The BBC requested an interview with the Public Prosecutor's Office about the allegations of mistreatment and torture of detainees, but had not received a response by the time of publication.
Juan was released in November, but according to Foro Penal's figures, there were still 1,794 political prisoners in Venezuela as of 30 December.
According to Juan, many of those detained in Tocorón have pinned their hopes on one date: that of the presidential inauguration on 10 January 2025.
It is the day that opposition candidate Edmundo González, who has been living in exile in Spain, has said that he will return to Venezuela and take up office as president.
He bases his claim to the presidency on official voting tallies the opposition managed to gather with help of election observers.
These tallies, which amount to 85% of the total, have been uploaded to a website and reviewed by independent observers who say that they suggest an overwhelming victory for González.
On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden met González and called him the ""true winner"" of the Venezuelan election.
However, it is not clear how González, for whom the authorities have issued an arrest warrant, plans to enter Venezuela or who would swear him in given that the National Assembly is dominated by Maduro loyalists.
Nevertheless, Juan says that the prisoners held in Tocorón are hoping against hope that Friday will see a change of government and their release from jail.
Meanwhile, the Maduro government has labelled any talk of a political transition as ""a conspiracy"" and has threatened that anyone who backs a change of leader ""will pay for it"".
Juan admits feeling a certain sense of guilt for being free when hundreds of his ""comrades are still suffering"" in prison.
But he says he is determined to return to the streets to show his support for Edmundo González on 10 January.
""I no longer fear the Venezuelan government,"" he explains.
""They already accused me of the worst crimes, such as terrorism, even though I'm just a young man who has done nothing more than love his country and help those around him.""
""I'm not afraid,"" Juan repeats, before admitting that he has left some written testimony in a safe place ""in case something happens to me"".

BBC News","US President Joe Biden has called the exiled candidate for Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, ""the true winner"" of the country's presidential election last July after meeting him at the White House.
In a social media post, Biden said Venezuela deserved a ""peaceful transfer of power"".
González fled to Spain in September after turmoil following Venezuela's election, in which incumbent President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory - something disputed by González and many sections of the international community.
The Maduro government reacted to the meeting with fury, calling it ""grotesque"" and accusing Biden of backing a violent anti-democratic project, Reuters news agency reports.
Tension has been rising in the country as the day of the presidential inauguration - set for Friday - approaches, with both Maduro and González telling their supporters that they will be sworn in.
The Maduro government, which has been in power since 2013, has deployed thousands of police and cut off major roads leading into the capital, Caracas, in what is widely seen as a tactic to deter any anti-government protests.
But González, who has been living in exile in Spain since September, says he will defy an arrest warrant which has been issued for him and return to his homeland to take up office.
However, he has not given any details as to how he plans to enter Venezuela, where the government is offering a $100,000 (£80,000) reward for information leading to his arrest.
González has also not said how he plans to be sworn in when the National Assembly - the legislative body where the presidential oath is performed - is firmly in the hands of government loyalists.
The opposition has nevertheless remained defiant and called on its supporters to take to the streets on Thursday.
It has also rallied key international support with González's visit to the White House - the latest stop in a tour which has also seen him meet with the Argentine and Uruguayan presidents.
In all three countries, he was met by cheering crowds of Venezuelans who held up signs reading ""freedom"".
Almost eight million Venezuelans have left their homeland in recent years to escape economic hardship and political persecution, and many of them are living in Latin America and the US.
Following Biden's meeting with González on Monday, the White House said it would be ""closely"" following the response Venezuela's authority will give to the opposition protests planned for Thursday.
In the aftermath of July's election, thousands of Venezuelans who had expressed their anger at Maduro's claim of election victory were arrested and charged with ""terrorism"". Many remain behind bars.
Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running in the election and who threw her weight behind Edmundo González, told AFP news agency on Monday that all the Maduro government had left was fear.
""If we all come out, millions, how can a few hundred or a few thousand armed people [prevail] against 30 million Venezuelans?"" she asked.
Referring to the voting tallies that the opposition has made public, she also insisted that the ""whole world knows"" González is ""the rightful president-elect"".
The voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election.
The government-aligned National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner on 29 July, the day after the vote, but it has to this day failed to provide the tallies to back up its claim.
With the help of accredited election witnesses, the opposition managed to collect and publish more than 80% of the voting tallies.
Independent observers and media, including US outlets the New York Times and CNN, have reviewed the tallies and say they suggest that Edmundo González won the election with 67% of the votes, compared to Maduro's 30%.
In December, the UN Human Rights Committee ordered Venezuela ""to refrain from destroying"" the voting tallies.",Latin America

A first group of 75 soldiers arrived on Friday and another 75 on Saturday, all drafted from the military police, according to Guatemala's government.
A state of emergency has been in place across the Caribbean nation for months as the government battles violent gangs that have taken control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince.
The forces are in Haiti to boost a United Nations-backed security mission led by Kenya that has so far failed to prevent violence from escalating.
Kenya sent nearly 400 police officers in June and July last year to help combat the gangs.
This was the first tranche of a UN-approved international force that will be made up of 2,500 officers from various countries.
A small number of forces from Jamaica, Belize and El Salvador are also in Haiti as part of the mission and the US is the operation's largest funder.
In March 2024, armed gangs stormed Haiti's two biggest prisons, freeing around 3,700 inmates.
The Ouest Department - a region including Port-au-Prince - was originally put under a state of emergency on 3 March, after escalating violence gripped the capital.
Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left Haiti the poorest nation in the Americas.

Footage of one of Janaína Lima's employees hauling away the facilities was posted online as her tenure as Sao Paulo councilwoman ended.
""I decided to donate the equipment I acquired with my own resources to the chamber,"" she said in statement on X, following a social media backlash.
""Obviously, neither I nor my advisers need a toilet.""
CCTV cameras caught employees in her office removing the facilities that were installed when she took office eight years ago.
In a statement posted on social media, Lima said the bathroom renovation was paid for with her own money and therefore not an asset belonging to the council.
Lima said she had followed the guidance of the legal department, that had indicated that all personally installed resources should be removed.
She told Brazilian media outlet G1 the hydraulics in the building are ""sensitive"".
The 41-year-old added that other fixtures she had bought for the office - such as a glass partition and industrial-style light fittings - would remain in place for her successor.
Lima served as a councillor for the New Party until 1 January.

Boric travelled with a group of scientists and several cabinet members, including ministers for the armed forces and the environment, his office said.
Boric said his visit underlined Chile's determination to play a key role in scientific projects in the area, especially those involving climate change.
In a statement, the government said research centres, universities, diplomats and the armed forces had united to ensure that Chile becomes the world's gateway to the Antarctic.
Leftist President Gabriel Boric won Chile's presidential election in 2021 to become the country's youngest ever leader, at 35 years of age.
Only two other world leaders had visited the South Pole before Boric: the prime ministers of New Zealand and Norway.

BBC News","Five people have been charged in connection with the death of One Direction singer Liam Payne in Argentina, the authorities there say.
The 31-year-old star died on 16 October after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires.
The hotel's manager, Gilda Martin, and its receptionist, Esteban Grassi, as well as Payne's friend Roger Nores have been charged with manslaughter, Argentina's prosecutor's office says.
Ezequiel Pereyra - who also worked at the hotel - and Braian Paiz, a waiter, have been charged with supplying drugs.
Under Argentina's legal system, the prosecutor's office gathers evidence which it then presents to a judge, who has to decide whether to proceed to trial.
According to a statement released by the prosecutor's office, Judge Laura Bruniard already took the decision to proceed to the next stage on Friday.
The defendants' lawyers can appeal against that decision. If their appeals are not successful, the trial phase starts.
In court documents, Judge Bruniard listed the charges against the five suspects, who are referred to by their initials, as is the custom in court documents at this stage of the proceedings.
Judge Bruniard said that she did not think that Liam Payne's friend, the hotel manager and the receptionist ""had planned or wanted the death of Payne"" but that their actions had created a ""risk"" to his life.
If found guilty, the three could face sentences of between one and five years in prison.
The sentence for supplying drugs is more severe and ranges between four and 15 years in jail.
Judge Bruniard has ordered the two accused of supplying the drugs be remanded in custody.
They have been summoned to appear within 24 working hours.
Fernando Madeo Facente, the lawyer representing Braian Paiz, told the BBC that he had advised his client not to hand himself in.
He said that Braian Paiz posed no flight risk and had in no way hindered the investigation. To the contrary, he had handed over his mobile phone containing chats with Liam Payne to the authorities willingly.
The lawyer argued that holding Braian Paiz in pre-trial detention would therefore be completely unnecessary and over the top.
He also argued that the prosecution had gone too far when it had accused his client of selling drugs to Payne.
Mr Madeo Facente said that his client and Payne had spent time together ""during which they talked and did a lot of things, in private"".
""And one of those things they did was to consume drugs,"" the lawyer said.
But he insisted that no money had been exchanged and that allegations to the contrary were ""completely false"" and lacking in evidence.
He also emphatically rejected articles in the Argentine media which had described his client as ""Liam Payne's dealer"".
In November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in Payne's body.
A post-mortem examination determined his cause of death as ""multiple trauma"" and ""internal and external haemorrhage"", as a result of the fall from the hotel balcony.
According to the prosecutor's office, medical reports also suggested Payne may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness.
The prosecutor's office said this ruled out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act by Payne, and they had concluded the singer did not know what he was doing nor have any comprehension of his actions.
Speaking to US celebrity news outlet TMZ after Payne's death, Roger Nores said he was a ""very good friend"" of the singer and they had spent time together on the day the star died.
He said Payne ""seemed playful and happy"" when he left him about an hour before the musician fell from the balcony.
After Payne's death, police found substances in his hotel room and objects and furniture that had been damaged.
Hotel staff had made two calls to emergency services saying they had a guest who had taken ""too many drugs and alcohol"", and was ""trashing the entire room"", it was previously reported.
Payne became one of the most recognisable names in pop after appearing on The X Factor and rising to fame with the boyband One Direction in the 2010s before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in January 2016.
The singer's funeral was held in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, last month.
His former bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik were among the mourners, alongside Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy and his former partner Cheryl, with whom he shares a son.",Latin America

BBC News","Trinidad and Tobago has declared a state of emergency as gang violence in the Caribbean nation continues to escalate.
President Christine Carla Kangaloo issued the declaration on the advice of Prime Minister Keith Rowley, who had been under growing pressure to take action over worsening crime figures.
The twin-island republic has one of the highest homicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a record murder tally of more than 620 this year so far in a population of 1.5 million people.
Organised crime is responsible for the majority of the murders, many of them linked to the international drug trade.
According to the US state department, the country's close proximity to Venezuela, porous borders and direct transportation routes to Europe and North America make it ""a prime location for narcotics trans-shipment"".
In the latest violent incident, five men were shot dead in a shop in the poverty-stricken Laventille area on Sunday. Police believe the killings were in reprisal for the murder of a prominent gang member the previous day.
Under the state of emergency, police will have the authority to arrest people on suspicion of involvement in crimes. They will also have the power to ""search and enter both public and private premises as necessary"".
The prime minister's office issued a statement saying the intention was to ""address individuals who pose a threat to public safety, particularly those involved in criminal activities and the illegal use of firearms"".
However, it added that there were no plans to impose a curfew.
It is unclear how the state of emergency will affect Trinidad's world-renowned Carnival, which is set to culminate in a massive street parade on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday in early March.
The event is a major tourist attraction which brings in tens of thousands of visitors from overseas, but heightened security measures could put a damper on the festivities.
The move comes as Trinidad and Tobago gears up for a general election, which must be held by August 2025.

BBC News","Arsenic has been found in the blood of one of three women who died after eating a Christmas cake in a suspected poisoning in Brazil, a police chief has told local media.
The highly toxic substance was also identified in the blood test results of a 10-year-old boy and the woman who made the cake - both of whom are still in hospital.
Five members of the same family fell ill after eating the cake at a gathering in Torres, in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state, on Monday afternoon.
Police have sent the cake for testing, and said several out-of-date food items were also found during a search at the woman's house. They added that it is not yet clear whether the suspected poisoning was intentional.
Test results from the cake are expected to be available by next week, according to local media.
On Friday, police requested for the body of a man - the late husband of the woman who made the cake - to be exhumed. He died in September from food poisoning, but police said his death was deemed natural at the time.
She is not considered a suspect in either of these cases at this time, and investigations are ongoing.
Six out of seven people at the Christmas celebration ate the cake on Monday afternoon, including the woman who baked it.
Police told Brazilian broadcasters that she is the only one believed to have eaten two slices of her homemade cake, and her tests returned the highest levels of arsenic.
Speaking to local media, police chief Marcos Vinicius Veloso said some of the family members complained that the cake had a ""peppery"" taste.
The family then began to experience symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and five of them sought medical help at the Nossa Senhora dos Navegantes Hospital at around 01:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Tuesday.
Hours later, two sisters died from cardiac arrest, the hospital said. They have been named in local media as Maida Berenice Flores da Silva, 58, and Tatiana Denize Silva dos Santos, 43.
The third victim, whose blood test presented traces of arsenic, died later on Tuesday evening from ""shock after food poisoning"", the hospital said.
She has been named locally as 65-year-old Neuza Denize Silva dos Anjos.
Arsenic is a metallic element that occurs naturally.
Its inorganic form is highly toxic and classified as a category one carcinogen by the EU - meaning it's known to cause cancer in humans.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic through drinking contaminated water or using it in food preparation, as well as irrigation of crops, industrial processes and smoking tobacco.
Because arsenic exists in soil, small amounts can get into food, though in general these levels are so low that they are not considered a cause for concern.
It is also used, albeit in limited cases, in pesticides and pharmaceuticals.",Latin America

BBC News","At least three people died when armed men in Haiti opened fire at journalists, police and medical staff during a briefing to announce the reopening of the country's biggest public hospital.
Two journalists and a police officer were reportedly shot dead, while others were wounded in Tuesday's attack in the general hospital in the capital Port-au-Prince.
The site had been recaptured by Haiti's government in July, after being occupied and destroyed by gangs.
The Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which controls much of the city, has owned up to the attack.
Pictures posted online appear to show several people injured or dead inside the building.
Journalists were waiting for the arrival of Health Minister Lorthe Blema when the shooting began.
Journalists Markenzy Nathoux and Jimmy Jean were killed during the attack, Robest Dimanche, spokesman for the Online Media Collective, told AFP news agency.
Other journalists were wounded, he added.
An officer was also killed, police spokesman Lionel Lazarre told AFP.
""It felt like a terrible movie,"" Dieugo André, a photojournalist who witnessed the violence, was quoted as saying by The Haitian Times.
""I have the blood of several injured journalists on my clothes.""
In an online video claiming the attack, the Viv Ansanm gang alliance said it had not authorised the reopening of the hospital, which they occupied and destroyed in March.
The head of Haiti's presidential transitional council, Leslie Voltaire, said: ""We express our sympathy to all the victims' families, in particularly to the Haiti National Police and all the journalists' associations.
""We guarantee them that this act will not remain without consequences.""
People in Haiti continue to suffer with unbearable levels of gang violence, despite the installation of a new transition government in April and the deployment of an international force led by Kenyan police officers six months ago.
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse.
An estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince is still under gang control.
The UN says that as many as 5,000 people have been killed in violence in Haiti this year alone, and the country is now on the verge of collapse.",Latin America

BBC News","There are fears of water contamination after a bridge collapsed in northern Brazil at the weekend, sending lorries carrying thousands of litres of pesticides and sulphuric acid into the river below.
Four people are known to have died, and more than 10 are missing after the central span of the bridge linking Tocantins and Maranhão states gave way on Sunday afternoon.
It is not clear if or how much the chemicals have leaked from their containers, but diving operations in the river have been halted while the situation is assessed.
Dramatic video filmed by a local councillor who went to the bridge to draw attention to cracks in it showed the start of the collapse.
Councillor Elias Junior said he never expected the bridge to actually collapse when he was there and was ""in shock"".
Eight vehicles plunged into the river, including the three lorries containing chemicals.
People in the cities of Estreito and Aguiarnopolis, on either side of the river, have been told to avoid collecting water from it.
Rescue operations are being carried out from boats. Four bodies have been recovered, including the female driver of one of the trucks and an 11-year-old girl, the fire service said. One man was rescued alive from the water on Sunday.
The Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira bridge - which is more than half a kilometre (1,600ft) long - was built in the 1960s and is the main link between the two states across the Tocantins river.",Latin America

Reporting fromPort-au-Prince, Haiti","Two-year-old Shaina is hooked up to an intravenous drip at one of the few functioning hospitals in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. Her mother, Venda, desperately hopes it will alleviate the acute malnutrition the emaciated young girl is suffering from.
Shaina is one of 760,000 children who are on the brink of famine in Haiti.
Terrified of the gang warfare raging in her neighbourhood, for weeks Venda was too frightened to leave her home to seek treatment for her daughter.
Now that she has made it to the paediatric ward, she hopes it is not too late for Shaina.
""I want to get proper care for my child, I don't want to lose her,"" she says tearfully.
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse, and now an estimated 85% of the capital is under gang control.
Even inside the hospital, Haitians are not safe from the fighting, which the UN says has killed 5,000 people this year alone and left the country on the verge of collapse.
The hospital's medical director explains that the previous day, police clashed with gang members in the emergency ward among terrified patients.
The victims of the violence are everywhere. One ward is full of young men with gunshot wounds.
Pierre is one of them.
He says he was walking home from work when he was caught in the crossfire of one street battle, with a bullet ripping through his collar bone.
""I think if the government were more stable and had put in place better youth programmes, they would not get involved in the gangs,"" he says of the young men who make up a large proportion of the groups terrorising the capital.
To combat the growing violence, the UN Security Council authorised the establishment of a Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in October 2023.
Funded primarily by the US, the Kenyan-led force deployed to Haiti six months ago tasked with restoring law and order.
On a patrol in downtown Port-au-Prince, the ferocity of the gang violence is clear.
Kenyan officers drive along the streets in heavily armoured personnel carriers (APC) through once bustling areas of the capital that now lie deserted. Shops and houses are boarded up.
Burnt out cars and debris are piled high along the side streets - barricades built by the gangs to block access.
The convoy weaves its way through the rubble when suddenly it comes under fire.
Bullets slam into the APC's armour as the Kenyan police shoot back with their assault rifles through gun ports in the vehicle's walls.
After nearly an hour of back-and-forth gunfire, the convoy moves on.
But it is not long before there are signs of more horrific gang violence. A human body burns in the middle of the street.
One of the Kenyan police in our APC says he suspects it was a gang member cornered and killed by a rival group, his body set alight to send a gruesome warning.
The Kenyan officers on our patrol are by now well accustomed to seeing this sort of brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince, but they also tell us they are exhausted.
Four hundred officers arrived in June - but they are hugely outnumbered. In July, Haiti's government estimated there were 12,000 armed gang members in the country.
The Kenyans were promised additional personnel. When the UN authorised the mission, a force of 2,500 was envisioned, but that support, which was supposed to arrive in November, has yet to materialise.
Despite the situation, the force's leadership remains optimistic. Commander Godfrey Otunge is under pressure from the Kenyan government to make a success of this mission.
The mission commander says there is ""overwhelming support"" for the MSS in Haiti.
""The population are demanding that our team extend and go to other places and pacify,"" he says.
The uphill struggle they face is clear at a former Haitian police station, which had been occupied by a gang but has now been re-taken by the Kenyan forces.
It is still entirely surrounded by gangs and, as officers head up to the roof, they come under sniper fire.
The Kenyan officers shoot back while urging everyone to remain low.
The Kenyan officers say some of their much-delayed additional forces will arrive by the end of this year, bringing their total to 1,000.
And the support is urgently needed. There are areas in Port-au-Prince which are under such tight gang control they are virtually impenetrable for the police.
In one such area, Wharf Jérémie, almost 200 civilians were killed by a single gang over the space of one weekend earlier in December.
In total, as many as 100 gangs are estimated to be operating in the Port-au-Prince area, with boys as young as nine joining their ranks.
And the problem only appears to be growing. According to the UN children's agency, Unicef, the number of children recruited to the gangs has soared by 70% in a year.
One of the gang leaders to whom they flock is Ti Lapli, whose real name is Renel Destina.
As head of the Gran Ravine gang, he commands more than 1,000 men from his fortified headquarters high above Port-au-Prince.
Gangs like his have exacerbated an already dire situation in Haiti, and are known to slaughter, rape and terrorise civilians.
Gran Ravine is infamous for carrying out kidnappings for ransom, a practice which has earned Ti Lapli a place on the FBI's wanted list.
Ti Lapli tells us that he and his gang members ""love our country a lot"" - but when pressed on the rapes and murders gangs like his inflict on civilians, he claimed his men ""do things they weren't supposed to do [to members of rival gangs] because the same is done to us"".
The reason children join Gran Ravine is simple, he says: ""The government doesn't create any jobs, it's a country with no economic activity whatsoever. We are living on trash, it's basically a failed state.""
He failed to acknowledge the strangulating impact gangs like his have on Haiti's economy. Often afraid to leave their homes for work, civilians are regularly extorted for money, too.
With 700,000 residents forced to flee their homes due to the violence inflicted by groups such as Gran Ravine, the capital's schools have become camps for internally displaced people.
Negociant is one of those who has had to seek shelter.
She sits with her five children, squeezed onto the small section of a school balcony they now call home.
""Just weeks ago I was living in my own house,"" she says. ""But gangs took over my neighbourhood.""
She explains that she left for an area of the city called Solino, until that too was overrun by gangs and she fled along with hundreds of other people.
""Today, again, I'm on the run to save my life and my children,"" she says.",Latin America

BBC News","Authorities in Guatemala have resisted efforts by members of a Jewish sect to recapture 160 children rescued from its premises.
The children were taken into care on Friday when police raided a farm used by the Lev Tahor movement, which is under investigation in several countries for serious sexual offences.
Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez said they were allegedly being abused by a member of the sect.
But on Sunday, sect members broke into a care centre where they were being held in an attempt to get them back, leading to scuffles with police.
The Lev Tahor sect is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.
It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.
The sect accuses the Guatemalan authorities of religious persecution.
The community settled in Mexico and Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. In 2022, members of the sect were arrested in a police operation in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, but they were later freed for lack of evidence.
The events began when police raided the sect's farm in Oratorio, south-east of Guatemala City, on Friday, taking the children into care.
Prosecutors said there were suspicions of ""forced pregnancy, mistreatment of minors and rape"".
But two days later, about 100 of the children's relatives - all members of the sect - gathered outside the centre where they were being held to call for their return.
Some sect members then forced open the gate and tried to abduct the children and adolescents sheltered there, the Attorney General's Office said.
But the children were intercepted by the authorities and put into a white minibus, local media reported.
With police help, the centre ""managed to locate and protect everyone again"", the Attorney General's Office added.
Officials had previously tried to check on the children's wellbeing, but were prevented from entering the farm by sect members.
Authorities estimate that the community is made up of about 50 families residing in Guatemala, the US, Canada and other countries.
The Jewish Community of Guatemala has issued a statement disowning the sect, describing it as foreign to its own organisation.
It expressed support for the Guatemalan authorities in carrying out necessary investigations ""to protect the lives and integrity of minors and other vulnerable groups that may be at risk"".",Latin America

BBC News","Ten members of a family have died after a private plane crashed into the city of Gramado in southern Brazil.
Brazilian businessman Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, who was piloting the plane, was killed in the crash alongside his wife, three daughters and other family members, a statement from his company said.
The small plane reportedly hit the chimney of a building, as well as a house and a shop as it fell.
Local authorities say 17 people on the ground were injured in the accident, including two in a serious condition.
Mr Galeazzi, 61, was taking his family on a trip to Jundiaí, in the São Paulo state, according to reports in Brazilian media.
All 10 victims of the crash were members of Mr Galeazzi's family, Rio Grande do Sul state governor Eduardo Leite told a press conference. He added that the plane had taken off in unfavourable weather conditions.
The plane reportedly flew for 3km (1.8 miles) before falling into the urban area of the city just minutes after take-off on Sunday morning.
""At the time, it was revving up. You could see that it was accelerating a lot,"" an eyewitness, Nadia Hansen, told Reuters news agency.
""Then there was a bang as it hit the building and then it passed close to my house and then it fell, and I thought it had dropped in front of the house,"" she said.
Pictures from the scene show emergency workers attending to the smoking wreckage among debris from badly damaged buildings.
Mr Galeazzi was the chief executive of Galeazzi & Associados, a corporate restructuring and crisis management firm based in São Paulo.
The company issued a statement on LinkedIn, paying tribute to the 61-year-old.
""Luiz Galeazzi will be eternally remembered for his dedication to his family and for his remarkable career as the leader of Galeazzi & Associados,"" the statement said.
""We also sympathize with all those affected by the accident in the region,"" it said, adding that it would co-operate with investigations into the accident.
The plane crashed near the centre of Gramado, hitting a house, a furniture store and a hotel, according to Brazilian media.
State governor Mr Leite said the cause of the accident was being investigated by the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Center (Cenipa).
""The entire state is mobilized here to provide the necessary assistance,"" he told reporters at the scene.
Gramado is a popular tourist destination, known for hosting events during the festive period.
The region was severely hit in May this year by unprecedented flooding, which claimed dozens of lives and displaced around 150,000 people from their homes.",Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86w44x083zo,The drug-trafficking Rio gangsters who see themselves as God's 'soldiers of crime',2024-12-21T01:13:57.174Z,"Lebo Diseko, Global Religion Correspondent & Julia Carneiro","When police in Rio de Janeiro seize blocks of cocaine and bundles of marijuana they may well find them branded with a religious symbol – the Star of David. This is not a reference to the Jewish faith, but to the belief of some Pentecostal Christians that the return of Jews to Israel will lead to the Second Coming of Christ.
The gang selling these branded drugs is the Pure Third Command, one of Rio's most powerful criminal groups, with a reputation both for making its opponents disappear, and for fanatical evangelical Christianity.
They took control of a group of five favelas in the north of the city – now known as the Israel Complex – after one of their leaders had what he believed was a revelation from God, says theologian Vivian Costa, author of the book, Evangelical Drug Dealers.
She says the gangsters see themselves as ""soldiers of crime"", with Jesus as ""the owner"" of the territory they dominate.
Controversially, some have dubbed them ""Narco-Pentecostals"".
One man who has experience of crime and religion – though in his case, not at the same time – is Pastor Diego Nascimento, who became a Christian after hearing the gospel from a gangster holding a gun.
Looking at him, it's hard to believe that this boyish looking 42-year-old Wesleyan Methodist minister with a ready smile and dimples, was once a member of Rio's notorious Red Command crime gang and managed its activities in the city's Vila Kennedy favela.
Four years in prison for drug dealing weren't enough to make him give up crime. But when he became addicted to crack cocaine his standing in the gang plummeted.
""I lost my family. I practically lived on the street for almost a year. I went so far as to sell things from my house to buy crack,"" he says.
It was at that point, when he was at rock bottom, that a well-known drug dealer in the favela summoned him.
""He started preaching to me, saying there was a way out, that there was a solution for me, which was to accept Jesus,"" he recalls.
The young addict took this advice and began his journey to the pulpit.
Pastor Nascimento still spends time with criminals, but now it is through his work in prisons, where he helps people turn their lives around, as he did himself.
Despite having been converted by a gangster, he regards the idea of religious criminals as a contradiction in terms.
""I don't see them as evangelical believers,"" he says.
""I see them as people who are going down the wrong path and have a fear of God because they know that God is the one who guards their lives.
""There is no such thing as combining the two, being an evangelical and a thug. If a person accepts Jesus and follows the Biblical commandments, that person cannot be a drug dealer.""
Evangelical Christianity will, by some predictions, overtake Catholicism as Brazil's biggest religion by the end of the decade.
As it has grown, the charismatic Pentecostal movement has particularly resonated with people living in the gang-ridden favelas, and now some of those gangs are drawing on elements of the faith they grew up with to wield power.
One accusation made against them is that they are using violence to suppress Afro-Brazilian faiths.
Christina Vital, a sociology professor at Rio's Fluminense Federal University, says Rio's poor communities have long been living ""under siege"" from criminal gangs, and this is now affecting their freedom of religion.
""In the Israel Complex, people with other religious beliefs cannot be seen to practise them publicly. It's not an exaggeration to speak of religious intolerance in that territory.""
Vital says Afro-Brazilian Umbanda and Candomblé religious houses have been shut down in surrounding neighbourhoods too, with gangsters sometimes drawing messages on the walls such as ""Jesus is the Lord of this place.""
Followers of Afro-Brazilian faiths have long faced prejudice, and drug dealers are not the only people who have targeted them.
But Dr Rita Salim, who heads the Rio police Department for Racial and Intolerance Crimes, says threats and attacks by narco-gangs have a particularly powerful impact.
""These cases are more serious because they are imposed by a criminal organisation, by a group and its leader, who imposes fear on the whole territory it dominates.""
She notes that an arrest warrant has been issued for the man thought to be the number one crime boss in the Israel Complex, for allegedly ordering armed men to attack an Afro-Brazilian temple in another favela.
While allegations of religious extremism in Rio's favelas first gained attention in the early 2000s, the problem has ""increased dramatically"" in recent years, according to Marcio de Jagun, co-ordinator of Religious Diversity at Rio's City Hall.
Jagun, who is a babalorixá (high priest) of the Candomblé religion, says the issue is now a national one, with similar attacks seen in other Brazilian cities.
""This is a form of neo-Crusade,"" he says. ""The prejudice behind these attacks is both religious and ethnic, with outlaws demonising religions from Africa and claiming to banish evil in the name of God.""
But religion and crime have long been intertwined in Brazil, says theologian Vivian Costa. In the past, gangsters would ask for protection from Afro-Brazilian deities and Catholic saints.
""If we look at the birth of the Red Command, or the birth of the Third Command, Afro religions [and Catholicism] have been there since their beginning. We see the presence of Saint George, the presence of [the Afro-Brazilian god] Ògún, the tattoos, the crucifixes, the candles, the offerings.
""That is why to call it Narco-Pentecostalism is to reduce that relationship that is so historic and traditional between crime and religion. I prefer to call it 'Narco-Religiosity'.""
Whatever one calls this mix of faith and criminality, one thing seems clear: it jeopardises a right that is enshrined in Brazil's constitution – that of religious freedom.
And it is yet one more way in which violent drug traffickers cause harm to the communities forced to live under their rule.",Latin America

BBC News","An amphibious mouse with webbed feet and a blob-headed fish are among 27 new species scientists have discovered in Peru.
They were found in an expedition to Alto Mayo - which includes the Amazon rainforest - by scientists from the non-profit organisation Conservation International and members of local indigenous groups.
Up to 48 other new species may also have been found, although further study will be needed to determine whether they are new, Conservation International says.
""Discovering so many new species of mammals and vertebrates is really incredible, especially in such a human-influenced landscape,"" said Trond Larsen, senior director at Conservation International.
Alto Mayo is a protected area in northern Peru with multiple ecosystems and Indigenous territories.
It has a relatively high population density, putting pressure on environmentalism through deforestation and agricultural expansion, Conservation International said.
Yulisa Tuwi, an Awajún woman who assisted with the research, said the report ""allows the Awajún to protect our culture, natural resources and our territory"", as it gives them a better understanding of the ecosystems.
""[The Awajún] have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with,"" Mr Larsen said.
The expedition also found a new species of dwarf squirrel, eight types of fish, three amphibians and 10 types of butterfly.
This ""blob-headed"" fish is a new discovery to science, but the Indigenous Awajún people who helped with the expedition were already aware of its existence.
The fish scientists were particularly shocked by its enlarged head - something they had never seen before.
This dwarf squirrel measures just 14cm (5.5in), half the length of an average grey squirrel in the UK, which ranges from 24 to 29cm, according to the UK Squirrel Accord.
""[It] fits so easily in the palm of your hand. Adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast,"" Larsen said.
""It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.""
Scientists discovered a new species of spiny mouse - named after the especially stiff guard hairs found on their coats, which function similar to the spines of a hedgehog.
They also found a new ""amphibious mouse"", which has partially webbed feet and eats aquatic insects.

BBC News","A forensic expert, three police officers and a music impresario have been jailed for covering up the 2015 murder of Venezuelan rapper Canserbero.
Canserbero, who had been named best Spanish-language rapper by Rolling Stone magazine, was drugged and stabbed to death by his manager, Natalia Améstica.
Améstica and her brother then threw his body from a 10th floor window.
The five people sentenced on Tuesday have been found guilty of helping the siblings stage the crime scene so Canserbero's murder appeared a suicide.
They have been given jail terms ranging between 15 and 20 years.
Natalia Améstica and her brother Guillermo were already sentenced to 25 years in prison back in February for murder.
The death on 19 January 2015 of Canserbero, whose real name was Tirone González, shocked the Venezuelan rap scene.
It was ruled at the time that the 26-year-old star had killed his friend Carlos Molnar in a knife fight before jumping from a window.
But in December 2023, Natalia Améstica confessed to stabbing both Molnar and Canserbero.
In a video statement released by the Venezuelan attorney general last year she recounted what had happened on the night.
Natalia Améstica claims that she was angry with the rapper after she had learned that Canserbero no longer wanted her as his manager.
She described how Canserbero came to her apartment in the Venezuelan city of Maracay on 19 January 2015.
He was accompanied by his friend Carlos Molnar, who was also Natalia Améstica's long-term boyfriend.
""The chance arose to make them a tea,"" she explained in the video, adding that she spiked their beverage with a powerful tranquiliser.
When her drugged partner Carlos Molnar entered the kitchen, she stabbed him in the neck, in the back and in the arm.
Canserbero witnessed Améstica's attack on her boyfriend but, under the influence of the drugs Améstica had slipped him, he collapsed on the sofa.
Améstica then proceeded to stab him twice.
""In desperation, I then called my brother Guillermo to help me resolve the situation,"" she said in the video confession.
Her brother arrived with the three officers from Venezuela's intelligence agency, Sebin, who have now been sentenced.
""They finished arranging the scene in a way to make it look like a murder-suicide,"" according to Natalia Améstica.
She said that the officers ""stabbed Carlos [Molnar] a few more times, my brother Guillermo stabbed him four times. The rest, the Sebin officials did"".
""Then we were told how to throw him out of the window to complete the murder-suicide scene,"" she said in her confession.
Her brother Guillermo said that a forensic detective who arrived at the scene became suspicious, remarking that it appeared ""manipulated"".
According to Guillermo Améstica, the forensic expert asked for a bribe of $10,000 (£7,880) in exchange for helping the siblings cover up the crime and to make it look like Canserbero had attacked Molnar before jumping out of the window.
The fifth man sentenced on Tuesday is Marcos Pratolongo, a music impresario who provided security at some of Canserbero's concerts.
At the time of his arrest, Venezuela's attorney general had said that Pratolongo was in possession of the keys to Canserbero's apartment, from which important evidence had disappeared.
The attorney general posted on social media on Tuesday that Pratolongo had been found guilty of complicity in Canserbero's murder but did not provide further details of his role in the crime.",Latin America

BBC News","The founder of the feared Los Zetas drugs cartel has been deported to Mexico after serving a lengthy jail sentence in the United States.
Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, 57, led Los Zetas until 2003, when he was cornered by Mexican soldiers near his hometown of Matamoros.
Under his leadership, the group became one of the most powerful and brutal hit squads in the Mexican drug wars.
US immigration officials handed Cárdenas over to Mexican police at the Otay border crossing, where he was quickly re-arrested and taken to El Altiplano maximum security jail in Mexico state.
Mexican prosecutors said he had been arrested on charges of murder and organised crime dating back to his time as one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico.
Cárdenas Guillén made his criminal career in the Gulf drugs cartel in the 1990s, reportedly not shying away from having his allies killed to rise to the top, a practice which earned him the nickname of ""Mata Amigos"" (Spanish for ""killer of friends"").
But what he became infamous for was recruiting members of Mexico's elite special forces and using them as hitmen and enforcers for the Gulf cartel.
The law enforcers-turned-contract killers became known as Los Zetas.
The brutal methods they used, such as decapitating and dismembering their victims, quickly spread terror through the north-eastern part of Mexico which was their stronghold.
By the early 2000s, Cárdenas Guillén was one of the most wanted men in Mexico.
Mexican security forces managed to apprehend him in his home state of Tamaulipas in 2003 after a bloody gun battle.
Aware of the power the gang leader wielded in the area, the security forces quickly flew him to the capital, Mexico City, were he was put into pre-trial detention.
In 2007, he was extradited to the US.
There, he was charged not just with trafficking tonnes of cocaine into the US but also with threatening to assault and murder federal agents.
He pleaded guilty in 2010 and was sentenced to 25 years in jail.
Having served a large part of his sentence, he was released in August of 2024 from federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
This paved the way for his deportation to Mexico on Monday.
Mexican prosecutors said there were seven federal cases still open against Cárdenas Guillén and that he could be sentenced to a total of more than 700 years in prison if found guilty on all charges.",Latin America

BBC News","Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been discharged from hospital after undergoing emergency surgery for a brain bleed, doctors said.
The 79-year-old appeared alongside his medical team at a news conference at Sírio-Libanês hospital in São Paulo.
""This here is not an interview, this is simply a session to say thanks. To thank, firstly, God, who has looked after me in a very generous manner,"" he said.
Lula was taken to hospital on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache.
Doctors performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced.
The brain bleed, or intracranial haemorrhage, was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement.
""Thank you very much for the prayers,"" Lula added on Sunday. ""And for those who only have hate, you're forgiven. I am here, alive, whole, and with more desire to work.""
On Tuesday, doctors said the president was in a stable condition following the surgery and was conscious.
Lula was ""lucid"" and conversing with medical staff, they added.
They also insisted that he had not sustained any brain injury and was not experiencing after-effects from the surgery.
Asked when he would return to the capital, doctors had said that if everything went well, they expected Lula to be back in Brasilia ""next week"".
While Lula was in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin took on some of the president's commitments.
The doctors said the bleeding was a result of the fall Lula had sustained in October.
They explained that it was not unusual for problems from a blow to the head to appear ""months later"".
Lula had slipped in the bathroom in the Alvorada Palace on 19 October and hit the back of his head. On Sunday, he explained he had been cutting his toe nails at the time and had been sitting down.
He went on to have five stitches. On his doctors' advice, the president cancelled his planned trip to Russia for a summit of the Brics countries.
He returned to full duties days later.
Lula has been in power since January last year after narrowly beating the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in a bitterly fought election.
During the election campaign, he often joked that he had ""the energy of a 30-year-old"".

That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can ""make Argentina great again"".
Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is ""experiencing a giant improvement"" under his leadership.
But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?
Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.
In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.
Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.
All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.
Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.
Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing ""a fantastic job"" in Argentina by ""deleting entire departments"" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.
But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.
Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that ""taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense"".
""The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.""
Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was ""bursting into crisis every few years"".
""That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.""
Marcelo J García, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a ""masterpiece"" of political marketing that has ""captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe"".
But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.
""I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,"" he told the BBC.
He points out that Trump's policies ""require big government in some areas"", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. ""You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.""
In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.
Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the ""woke agenda"". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.
Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur ""has ended up becoming a prison"".
""If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?"" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.
Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.
Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.
He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.
Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: ""You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.""
The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.
As Marcelo J García sees it, Milei is a ""divisive leader"" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.
""The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,"" he says.
""Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,"" he adds.
In his view, this is a real weakness: ""You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.""
Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam.",Latin America

BBC News","Gunmen in Mexico have shot dead a judge outside a courthouse in the city of Acapulco.
Judge Edmundo Román Pinzón was hit by at least four bullets as he was driving out of the courthouse car park on Wednesday afternoon, local time.
He was a senior judge who had been president of the highest court in the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located.
The murder comes amid a surge in deadly attacks on officials in the violence-wracked southern state.
Police have been speaking to witnesses and been gathering CCTV footage from the murder scene, but so far no arrests have been made in connection with the case.
The security forces have also stepped up their activities in the resort town in order to catch those responsible.
According to local paper El Sol de Acapulco, the judge had been in charge of the court which dealt with murders, kidnappings and car thefts.
It is not yet known what the possible motive behind the murder may have been.
The governor of Guerrero state said the crime demanded ""immediate justice"".
The killing of the judge is the latest in a string of extremely violent attacks in Guerrero over the past weeks.
Last month, the bodies of 11 people, including two children, were found inside a vehicle in the town of Chilpancingo, 100km (62 miles) north of Acapulco.
Acapulco, once a popular beach resort, has not been spared, with rival gangs battling for control of the city's drugs market - and at times leaving mutilated bodies on beaches.",Latin America

Business reporter
Reporting fromBogotá, Colombia","We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?
While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.
That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.
This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.
So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernabéu Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?
Born in the Colombian city of Medellín in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.
Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.
While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.
She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.
Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Mañana Será Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.
Karol G's style of music is more often described as ""reggaeton"". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.
While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Rocío Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer – and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.
""Streaming democratised the landscape,"" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.
""Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.""
Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.
Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (£1.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.
And this year, Karol's G's Mañana Será Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.
This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Mañana Será Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.
Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.
""There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,"" he adds.
Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Español at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.
""I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,"" she says. ""And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.
""And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,"" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.
Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs ""Bichota"". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.
She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.
Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.
Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.
Ms Cobo says: ""She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.""
Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.
This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.
Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.
Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.
However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. ""It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,"" she says.",Latin America

BBC News","The number of cases of dengue fever in Central and South America has nearly tripled to a record high this year, the Pan American Health Organisation (Paho) said on Tuesday.
More than 12.6m cases and 7,700 deaths were recorded in what Paho says is the biggest outbreak in the region since records began in 1980.
Brazil, Argentina, Colombia in South America and Mexico in North America were hit especially hard by the virus, accounting for the majority of cases and deaths.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause serious illness or death in some cases.
Symptoms include a fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and a blotchy rash.
Those with a more severe type of dengue might experience severe stomach pain, fatigue, vomiting, and blood in vomit or stool.
Vaccines have been introduced in some countries in the region, while others, such as Honduras, plan to start distribution in 2025.
In a statement, Paho urged for stronger mitigation efforts and collaboration across the Americas.
Its director, Dr Jarbas Barbosa, said the high number of cases was linked to a hotter, wetter climate and factors such as accumulated water around the home and poor waste management, which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
He also said the virus was posing a ""higher-than-normal"" risk to children.
In Guatemala, 70% of dengue-related deaths were children, while in Mexico, Costa Rica and Paraguay, under-15s made up more than a third of severe cases, Paho data showed.
Children and people with pre-existing health conditions are more likely to catch the disease and develop more serious symptoms.
Around half the world's population live in areas with a risk of contracting the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

BBC News","Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is doing ""well"" after undergoing surgery for a brain bleed, his doctors say.
The 79-year-old was taken to hospital in the capital, Brasília, on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache.
An MRI scan revealed the bleed and Lula was transferred to the renowned Sírio-Libanês hospital in São Paulo to have it drained.
The intracranial haemorrhage was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement.
Doctors said they had performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced.
In a news conference on Tuesday morning local time, the doctors said that the president was in a stable condition following the surgery and was conscious.
They said Lula was ""lucid"" and conversing with medical staff.
They also insisted that he had not sustained any brain injury and was not experiencing and after-effects from the surgery.
Asked when he would return to the capital, doctors said that if everything went well, they expected Lula to be back in Brasilia ""next week"".
Earlier, the presidential spokesman, Paulo Pimenta, had said that Lula would likely remain in the intensive care unit for another 48 hours.
""He is stable, conscious and calm,"" Mr Pimenta said.
While Lula is in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin will take on some of the president's commitments, including welcoming Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is due to arrive in Brazil later today.
The doctors said the bleeding was a result of the fall Lula had sustained in October.
They explained that it was not unusual for problems from a blow to the head to appear ""months later"".
Lula had slipped in the bathroom in the Alvorada Palace on 19 October and hit the back of his head.
He had to have five stitches and, on his doctors' advice, cancelled his planned trip to Russia for a summit of the Brics countries.
He returned to full duties days later.
Lula has been in power since 1 January 2023 after narrowly beating the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in a bitterly fought election.
During the election campaign, he often joked that he had ""the energy of a 30-year-old"".",Latin America

BBC News","At least 110 mostly elderly people have been brutally murdered by gang members in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, according to a human rights group.
The National Human Rights Defence Network (RNDDH) said a local gang leader had targeted them after his son fell ill and subsequently died.
The gang leader reportedly consulted a voodoo priest who blamed elderly locals practising ""witchcraft"" for the boy's mystery illness.
The United Nations said the number of people killed in Haiti so far this year in spiralling gang violence had reached ""a staggering 5,000"".
Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting
While details from the massacre are still emerging, the UN's human rights chief Volker Türk on Monday put the number of people killed over the weekend ""in violence orchestrated by the leader of a powerful gang"" at 184.
The killings happened in the Cité Soleil neighbourhood of the capital.
According to reports, gang members seized scores of residents aged over 60 from their homes in the Wharf Jérémie area, rounded them up and then shot or stabbed them to death with knives and machetes.
Residents reported seeing mutilated bodies being burned in the streets.
RNDDH estimated 60 were killed on Friday while another 50 were rounded up and murdered on Saturday, after the gang leader's son had died of his illness.
While RNDDH said that all the victims were over 60, another rights group said some younger people who had tried to protect the elderly had also been killed.
Local media said that elderly people believed to be practitioners of voodoo had been singled out because the gang leader had been told his son's illness had been caused by them.
Rights groups said the man who had ordered the killings was Monel Felix, also known as Mikano.
Mikano is known to control Wharf Jérémie, a strategic area in the port of the capital.
According to Romain Le Cour Grandmaison, a Haiti expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Crime (GI-TOC), the area is small but hard for the security forces to penetrate.
Local media said that residents had been prevented from leaving Wharf Jérémie by Mikano's gang, so news of the deadly killings was slow to spread.
The group forms part of the Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which controls much of the Haitian capital.
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse.
Data gathered by GI-TOC shows there was a decline in the murder rate between May and September of this year, after rival gangs had reached an uneasy truce.
But attempts by the gangs to expand their territory beyond their strongholds in the capital have led to particularly bloody incidents in the past two months, with ordinary residents rather than rival gang members being increasingly targeted.
On 3 October, 115 locals were killed in the small town of Pont-Sondé in the Artibonite department.
That massacre was reportedly carried out by the Gran Grif gang in retaliation for some residents joining a vigilante group to resist attempts by Gran Grif to extort locals.
If confirmed, the death toll given by the UN for this weekend's killings in Cité Soleil, would make it the deadliest incident so far this year.
With gangs in control of an estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince and increasingly large swathes of the countryside, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been forced to flee their homes.
According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 700,000 people - half of them children - are internally displaced across the country.
Gang members often use sexual abuse, including gang rape, to sow terror among the local population.
In a report published two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch researcher Nathalye Cotrino wrote that ""the rule of law in Haiti is so broken that members of criminal groups rape girls or women without fearing any consequences"".
Attempts by the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support Mission to quell the violence have so far failed.
The international police force arrived in Haiti in June to bolster the Haitian National Police but is underfunded and lacks the necessary equipment to take on the heavily armed gangs.
Meanwhile, the Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) - the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order - appears to be in turmoil.
The TPC replaced the interim prime minister last month and seems to have made little progress towards organising elections.

Ismail Barhoum, the head of the group's financial affairs, was killed in the strike on Nasser Hospital, the main medical facility in Khan Younis.
He was receiving treatment at the hospital after being wounded in an air strike four days ago, the official said.
Israel's military said it had struck a key Hamas member operating inside the hospital compound following ""an extensive intelligence-gathering process"" and said that ""precise munitions"" had been used to mitigate harm.
The Hamas-run health ministry said ""many others"", including medical personnel, were injured.
The hospital department that was hit was evacuated after a large portion was destroyed, the ministry said.
Footage verified by the BBC showed people attempting to extinguish a fire after the strike.
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as hiding places for weapons and command centres, which the group denies.
Another Hamas leader, Salah al-Bardaweel, was killed by a separate Israeli air strike in Khan Younis on Sunday, an official told the BBC.
At least 30 people were killed in Khan Younis and Rafah as of Sunday morning, before the strike on the hospital in the evening, the health ministry said.
Israel resumed its military campaign in Gaza on 18 March, ending a ceasefire that lasted almost two months. Hundreds of people have been killed in strikes since then.
Israel blamed Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the truce. Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of abandoning the original deal agreed in January.
The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 others taken hostage.

Reporting fromLondon","More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry has announced.
That number - 50,021 - equates to about 2.1% of the 2.3 million pre-war population of the territory, or around 1 in 46 people.
A total of 113,274 others had been injured in the same period, the health ministry said.
Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.
International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.
The figures released by the MoH for the number of people killed do not differentiate between civilians and fighters.
In November, the UN's Human Rights Office said its analysis showed close to 70% of verified victims over a six-month period were women and children.
In January, The Lancet medical journal published a study which suggested the death toll could in fact be substantially higher than official figures reported by MoH - by up to 41%.

BBC News","Israel's defence minister has told the military to ""seize additional areas in Gaza"" and threatened to permanently occupy parts of it, if Hamas does not free all remaining hostages.
Israel Katz said that the military would continue its ground operation in Gaza ""with increasing intensity"" until all of the hostages ""both living and dead"" were returned.
It is thought 24 of the 59 hostages still held in Gaza are alive, but their fate remains in the balance after negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire deal failed to progress.
The fragile ceasefire that had been in place since January ended this week as Israel resumed its ground campaign and bombing of Gaza, killing hundreds of people.
The situation in the Strip has been described as ""gravely, gravely concerning"" with ""absolutely desperate tragedies occurring all over Gaza"" by Sam Rose from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.
Israel and the US have accused Hamas of rejecting proposals to extend the ceasefire. Hamas has said it is ""engaging with the mediators with full responsibility and seriousness"".
However, Katz said in a statement on Friday that ""the more Hamas continues its refusal, the more territory it will lose to Israel"".
Katz added that Israel still agreed to a proposal, which was brought by US envoy Steve Witkoff, ""to release all the kidnapped, both living and dead, in advance and in two stages with a ceasefire in between"".
""We will intensify the fighting with strikes from the air, sea and land and by expanding the ground manoeuvre until the hostages are released and Hamas is defeated,"" Katz wrote.
The defence minister also said Israel would ""implement US President Trump's voluntary transfer plan for Gaza residents"".
Trump said he wants the US to take over and rebuild the Gaza Strip, while permanently removing its population of two million Palestinians.
The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have said Gaza is ""not for sale"", while the UN warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly prohibited under international law and ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"".
Months of negotiations, led by the US, Qatar and Egypt, saw a ceasefire deal proposed in three stages. Israel and Hamas failed to agree on how to take the truce beyond the first phase.
The plan stalled when the US and Israel proposed to extend stage one. Hamas rejected the change and said it was a ""blatant attempt"" by Israel ""to evade the agreement"".
The ceasefire was broken on Tuesday when Israel launched a heavy wave of airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 430 people in two days, the Hamas-run health ministry said. On Thursday, Hamas launched three rockets at Tel Aviv.
Blaming Hamas for the resumption of violence, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the group had ""rejected every hostage deal"".
Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive.
On Friday, the acting US ambassador to the UN squarely blamed Hamas for the ongoing war and resumption of fighting.
""Every death would have been avoided had Hamas accepted the bridge proposal,"" Dorothy Shea told the UN Security Council.
Hamas has denied it is responsible for stalling the negotiations, and said it ""remains deeply involved"" and is ""engaging with the mediators with full responsibility and seriousness"".
In a statement on Telegram, Hamas wrote it is discussing ""the Witkoff proposal and other different ideas put forward, all with the goal of securing a prisoner exchange deal that ensures the release of prisoners, ends the war, and achieves a withdrawal"" [of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip].
In his statement, Katz also said that civilians would be evacuated from the areas the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are targeting.
Previous evacuation orders have sent panic through Palestinians families, many of whom have been displaced repeatedly by the war and have few safe options left.
Israel blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas. It accused Hamas of commandeering the provisions as part of its strategy against Israel, though did not provide evidence for this claim.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 49,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says, and there is large-scale destruction to homes and infrastructure in the Strip.",Middle East

BBC News","Israel's Supreme Court has issued an injunction to prevent the head of the nation's security service from being fired by Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Israeli cabinet formally approved the early dismissal of Ronen Bar on Thursday night, over the failure to anticipate the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas.
Netanyahu, the prime minister, said in a video statement last week that he intended to sack Mr Bar, citing an ""ongoing distrust"" between the two that had ""grown over time"".
On Friday, the Supreme Court froze the dismissal until a hearing could be heard on the matter no later than 8 April, according to documents cited in Israeli media.
Ronen Bar was appointed in October 2021 for a five-year term as the chief of the Shin Bet - Israel's domestic intelligence agency.
His sacking would be the first time in Israel's history that a government has fired the Shin Bet's leader.
Netanyahu's plan to dismiss him sparked outrage and further inflamed anti-government demonstrations in Jerusalem, which saw thousands of Israelis join forces with protestors opposing Israel's renewed assault on Gaza.
A letter sent by Netanyahu to members of his government before the meeting on Thursday referenced a ""persistent loss of professional and personal trust"" between the prime minister and Bar, and proposed his term end on 20 April.
""The loss of professional trust has been consolidated during the war, beyond the operational failure of 7 October [2023], and in particular in recent months,"" it said, referring to the Hamas attacks on Israel which sparked the Israel-Gaza war.
The Shin Bet is Israel's domestic intelligence agency and plays a key role in the war. Its activities and membership are closely-held state secrets.
However, Bar has characterised the decision to remove him as politically motivated.
The Times of Israel said that he did not attend the cabinet vote, but sent a letter saying that firing him was ""entirely tainted by conflicts of interest"" as the Shin Bet investigates the prime minister's office over allegations of ""Qatar's involvement in the heart of Israeli decision-making"".
Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara late last month ordered the police and the Shin Bet to investigate officials within Netanyahu's office over alleged financial ties to Qatar. A gag order has since been issued on all information relating to the investigation. Netanyahu's Likud Party denies all allegations.
Baharav-Miara - a vocal critic of Netanyahu who is herself facing dismissal proceedings - argued that Bar could not be fired until the legality of the move had been assessed.
The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, an NGO, said it had launched an appeal against the ""illegal decision [...] posing a real risk to national security"".
Yesh Atid, the centre-right party led by Yair Lapid, said it had filed an appeal on behalf of several opposition parties and denounced the sacking as a ""decision taken due to a blatant conflict of interest by the prime minister"".
Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas invaded southern Israel on 7 October, 2023, killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostage.
More than 48,500 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, the Hamas-run health ministry says.
Israel ended a months-long ceasefire earlier this week and resumed its attacks on Gaza. More than 400 people were killed in the first night of bombing, according to the health ministry.
Large crowds of Israelis have protested over the resumption of the war and Netanyahu's moves to sack Bar.
Israel and Hamas failed to agree how to take the ceasefire beyond the first phase, with negotiations expected to have started six weeks ago.
Hamas did not agree to a renegotiation of the ceasefire on Israel's terms, although it did offer to release a living American hostage (and four bodies), to extend the current arrangement.
Israel blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas.",Middle East

Reporting fromJerusalem","An Israeli air strike on the southern city of Khan Younis in Gaza has killed top Hamas political leader Salah al-Bardaweel, a Hamas official has told the BBC.
Locals say the air strike killed both Bardaweel, regarded as Hamas's highest-ranking political leader, and his wife. Israeli officials had no immediate comment.
The total death toll in Gaza since the war began surpassed 50,000 on Sunday, its Hamas-run health authorities said, with least 30 people killed in Khan Yunis and Rafah so far on Sunday.
Israel resumed heavy strikes on Gaza earlier this week - in effect ending the first phase of a ceasefire that lasted almost two months. It blamed Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the truce.
Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of abandoning the original deal - mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US. It envisaged the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the subsequent release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners - in addition to negotiations to end the war entirely and reconstruct Gaza.
In a statement on Sunday, Hamas said Bardaweel, 66, had been praying along with his wife when an Israeli missile struck their tent.
A father of eight, Bardaweel was one of Hamas's most prominent political figures.
Born in Khan Younis refugee camp, he was known to be close to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and is considered part of the second generation of Hamas leadership, following the movement's founders.
He headed the political wing of Hamas's parliamentary bloc and was re-elected to the group's political bureau in 2021.
Following the killing of Sinwar and Rawhi Mushtaha during the ongoing war, Bardaweel was regarded as Hamas's highest-ranking political leader.
The air strike that killed Bardaweel was part of one of the most intense waves of aerial bombardment in southern Gaza since the collapse of the ceasefire agreement last Tuesday.
A spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent Society told the BBC that Israeli forces were surrounding several of the organisation's ambulances as they attempted to reach an area hit by an Israeli strike in Rafah.
He added that several paramedics were wounded, and contact had been lost with one of the trapped teams, which has been besieged for hours.
The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for residents of the Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood in western Rafah after the area was hit by heavy shelling and a limited ground assault.
The attack included tank fire from Israeli forces positioned along the Philadelphi Corridor on the border with Egypt, and helicopters also took part in the assault.
Alaa al-Din Sabah, a resident of the neighbourhood, said in a voice message to the BBC: ""Bullets are raining down on us like it's pouring. A woman was shot and is bleeding. Ambulances couldn't reach her.""
""I can see one of the paramedics lying on the ground, screaming.""
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 49,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says, and there is large-scale destruction to homes and infrastructure in the Strip.",Middle East

Reporting fromLondon","Israel has carried out multiple air strikes on Lebanon after several rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, in the worst violence since a ceasefire came into effect in November.
The Israeli military said it had hit dozens of rocket launchers and a command centre belonging to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group, in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon's health ministry said seven people, including a child, were killed and 40 injured in the air strikes.
Several armed groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and Palestinian factions, and no-one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Hours after the first set of strikes, a second wave of attacks were carried out at night on targets that included what the Israeli military described as command centres, infrastructure sites and a weapons storage facility in Lebanon.
Saturday's rocket attack from Lebanon came days after Israel reinforced its offensive against Hamas, a Hezbollah ally, in Gaza.
The Israeli military said it had intercepted three rockets in the northern Israeli town of Metula, and there were no casualties.
Hezbollah said it had no involvement, and it remained committed to the ceasefire.
The Lebanese military said it had dismantled ""three primitive rocket launchers"" in the south, and the country's defence minister said an investigation had been launched into the attack.
The developments put pressure on a fragile truce, brokered by the US and France, that ended more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, the Lebanese military would deploy thousands of additional soldiers to the south of the country to prevent armed groups from attacking Israel.
Hezbollah was required to remove its fighters and weapons, while the Israeli military would withdraw from positions occupied in the war.
But Israel has carried out nearly daily air strikes on what it describes as Hezbollah targets, and has indicated that attacks will continue to prevent the group from rearming.
The Israeli military is still occupying five locations in southern Lebanon, in what the Lebanese government says is a violation of the country's sovereignty and a breach of the deal.
Israel says the Lebanese military has not yet fully deployed to those areas, and that it needs to remain at those points to guarantee the security of its border communities.
Saturday's attack is further proof of the challenges facing the Lebanese army, as it tries to exert control over southern areas where Hezbollah has traditionally had a strong presence and support.
Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun, who came to power in January, has said only the state should have arms in the country, in what is seen as a reference to Hezbollah's arsenal.
On Saturday, he condemned ""attempts to drag Lebanon into a cycle of violence"", while Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the escalation carried the ""risk of dragging the country into another war"".
The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said it was ""alarmed by the possible escalation of violence"", urging both Israel and Lebanon to ""uphold their commitments"".
Hezbollah was battered in the conflict with Israel: many of its leaders were assassinated, hundreds of fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed.
The group faces the huge challenge of providing financial help to its communities affected by the war, and pressure from its opponents to disarm.
Lebanon's international partners say they will only help the country if the government acts to curb Hezbollah, the most powerful group in Lebanon.
Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
The longstanding conflict escalated and led to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.
The offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents.
Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border.",Middle East

in Tartous, Syria","When violence broke out in Syria's coastal area recently, including mass killings of civilians allegedly carried out as revenge for attacks on Syrian security forces, volunteer rescuers quickly came to help.
They were part of the Syrian civil defence group known as the White Helmets, which had operated in rebel-held areas during the civil war.
After the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, the White Helmets arrived in Syria's capital, Damascus, welcomed as heroes by those who had supported the opposition.
Since then, they have started operating in more areas of the war-ravaged country.
Most of those killed in the recent attacks, which occurred over a period of days earlier this month, were Alawites - an offshoot of Shia Islam, and Assad's minority sect.
Abdulkafi Kayal, head of operations for the White Helmets in Syria's coastal region, told the BBC that the group's work transcended politics: ""When we go to rescue someone in need, we don't ask them about their religion or political opinion... Our mandate is to help those in need"".
Throughout the civil war, Assad had branded the White Helmets a terrorist group, alleging it worked for armed rebels. But the group always said it was a neutral, humanitarian organisation and has been praised around the world for its work.
""We are Syrians, and we can't separate our care for one area more than the others,"" Mr Kayal said. ""It is our homeland, and we consider ourselves as an umbrella to serve all Syrians.""
The recent outburst of violence was the worst in Syria since interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa led the lightning rebel offensive that overthrew Assad.
Tensions had been brewing since December, when supporters of Assad killed 14 interior ministry troops in an ambush, two weeks after the former president was overthrown.
In early March, fighting broke out between security forces and fighters loyal to the previous regime, with dozens reportedly killed on both sides.
Syrian security forces were then accused of carrying out revenge killings of Alawites in the coastal province of Latakia - the sect's heartland.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, has since said more than 1,400 civilians were killed in Latakia and its neighbouring provinces Tartous, Hama and Homs.
BBC News has not been able to verify whether the killings were committed by the forces of Syria's new rulers.
The White Helmets, responding to such incidents, said they were conducting around 30 response calls a day at the height of the attacks - including the retrieval of more than 100 bodies.
""We are here to serve everyone without any differentiation,"" Mr Kayal said.
""Our slogan is 'To Save one life is to save all of the humanity'. It doesn't matter if it is a Muslim, Sunni, Alawite, Christian, Druze or even an atheist. Those families are our families.""
Last week, BBC News joined the White Helmets as volunteers got to work in Tartous following reports of a massacre in the village of Barmada.
The team retrieved 10 bodies of government fighters, which all appeared to have been thrown from a hillside into a valley. Their hands and legs were tied, suggesting they had been caught by the opposing side.
Saber, a state security officer who was at the scene, accused Assad loyalists of being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of his colleagues. BBC News could not independently verify this claim.
""When Syria was liberated from the Assad regime, we tried hard to keep everything under control, to unite Syria, with all its governorates and components, to rebuild a new Syria that we want to be proud of in the Middle East,"" he said.
But he added that this had been difficult, because ""when we took control of the country, we had a personal problem with the [anti-Assad] militia because the majority of them were victims of chemical attacks, bombs, massacres and many crimes that caused a devastating psychological impact on them"".
Images and video online appear to show soldiers killing civilians, including children, in the coastal areas where the Alawite killings took place.
One man, Maen, told BBC News his son and aunt had been killed by security forces. He buried them in his courtyard so they could remain close.
""We suffered under Assad and now we are prosecuted under this new government,"" he said.
Maen's wife wept as she looked at her son's photo. ""What did he do?"" she asked. ""He was 20 years old and did nothing to harm anyone.""
Al-Sharaa, Syria's interim president, has set up an independent committee to investigate the killings and has insisted the perpetrators would be held accountable.
But if his government wants to prevent a new civil war, many feel it must prove it can protect the Alawites and ensure the rights of all citizens in the new Syria.",Middle East

BBC News","A British bomb disposal expert has been injured in an attack on a UN facility in the Gaza Strip, the charity he works for has said.
The 51-year-old, who was not named, was one of five people injured in an explosion that also killed a UN worker at the facility in Deir al-Balah on Wednesday morning, the Mines Advisory Group said.
Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general, told BBC Newshour a full investigation into the incident would be needed.
The Israeli military has denied reports it targeted the UN compound and has said the explosion was not caused by Israeli fire.
David Lammy, the foreign secretary, confirmed in the Commons that a British national had been injured, adding their family was being offered support.
Lammy called for a ""transparent investigation"" into the air strike and for ""those responsible to be held to account"".
""We strongly oppose Israel's resumption of hostilities,"" he added. ""We urgently want to see a return to a ceasefire.""
Israel said earlier it was resuming fighting in Gaza following a two-month ceasefire - launching a wave of strikes that killed more than 400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The injured Briton is an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) expert who works for the Manchester-based mine clearance charity.
The charity's chief executive, Darren Cormack, said the man had been conducting an explosive hazards assessment at a UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) building at the time of the incident.
He was initially taken to hospital in Gaza for treatment and has since been moved to a hospital in Israel, Mr Cormack said.
""The UN has confirmed that today's incident did not occur in the course of normal EOD operations and resulted from ordnance being fired at or dropped on the building in which the team was working,"" he added.
""It is shocking that a humanitarian facility should be subject to attacks of this nature and that humanitarian workers are being killed and injured in the line of duty,"" he said. ""Attacks against humanitarian premises are a breach of international law.""
Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein wrote on X: ""The circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
""We emphasize that the initial examination found no connection to IDF activity whatsoever.""
Gaza's health ministry blamed an Israeli strike for the attack.
The UN's Farhan Haq told the BBC: ""We are making it clear that all military operations have to be conducted in a way that ensures that all civilians are respected and protected.""
The head of the UNOPS, Jorge Moreira da Silva, said he believed the explosion was ""not an accident"", adding that the situation in Gaza was ""unconscionable"".
The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as captives.
Israel responded with a massive military offensive, which has killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says, and caused huge destruction to homes and infrastructure.

Israel said it intercepted one of the missiles and the others fell into uninhabited land.
At least 591 people - including more than 200 children - have been killed since Israel resumed fighting on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday that it had started a ground operation in the Palestinian territory.
There had been a reprieve from large-scale military action since January, when a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began.
The IDF said late on Thursday that soldiers had begun ""conducting ground activity"" in Rafah, which lies in the south of the territory near the Egyptian border.
It said in a statement that troops had ""dismantled... terrorist infrastructure"", adding that IDF forces were also continuing ground activity in north and central Gaza.
Earlier, Israel's military said it had begun ""targeted ground activities"" to create what it called a ""partial buffer between the north and south"" of Gaza. It called the action a ""limited ground operation"".
IDF spokesperson Col Avichay Adraee said forces were deployed up to the centre of a strip, known as the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern and southern Gaza.
Israeli government spokesman, David Mencer, blamed Hamas for the resumption of violence, saying it had ""forced this escalation, it rejected every hostage deal, including the offers mediated by the US and others"".
Israel resumed attacks on Tuesday as talks to extend the ceasefire deal failed to progress, warning that they would intensify until Hamas released the remaining hostages.
Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive.
Meanwhile, five staff members of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa were among those killed over the ""past few days"", the agency's chief Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X.
""They were teachers, doctors and nurses,"" he added, warning that ""the worst is yet to come"" amid the ongoing ground invasion.
On Wednesday, the UN said that one of its workers had been killed after its compound in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza was damaged. While it said the circumstances remain unclear, UN Office for Project Services head Jorge Moreira said it was ""not an accident"" and ""at least an incident"".
Gaza's health ministry blamed an Israeli strike, which it said injured five others. Israel's military said it did not attack the compound but was investigating the incident.
The US - a major weapons supplier to Israel - said that it was committed to international law regarding the supply of weapons supplies.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said US President Donald Trump ""fully supports Israel and the IDF in the actions that they've taken in recent days"".
UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy confirmed on Thursday that a UK national had been wounded in the compound attack. It comes after a charity said one of its workers, a 51-year-old British bomb disposal expert, had been injured.
""Our priority is supporting them and their family at this time,"" he told MPs.
At the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Qasim Abu Sharqiya said his two-year-old son, Omar, had been born through in vitro fertilisation (IVF) after five years of trying.
""They bombed a tent next to us and he died,"" he told AFP. ""Omar is my only son, oh world, and I have no one else.""
A doctor there, Tanya Haj Hassan, told the BBC's Newshour that she had heard of at least 76 people who ""didn't even make it into the ER"" but were taken ""straight to the mortuary"".
She recalled ""a level of horror and evil that is really hard to articulate - it felt like Armageddon"".
Thousands of Israelis joined anti-Netanyahu protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, calling for the return of the hostages.
Several arrests were made, with police in Jerusalem deploying a water cannon against demonstrators.
Elsewhere, Yemen's Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile at Israel on Thursday, aiming for Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, the Iran-backed group's military spokesperson said.
No injuries were reported and the IDF said the missile was stopped before entering Israel.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that it had ""resumed combat in full force"" and any ceasefire negotiations would now take place ""under fire"".
A group representing hostages' families has accused the Israeli government of choosing ""to give up the hostages"" by launching new strikes.
Israel and Hamas have failed to agree how to take the ceasefire beyond the first phase, which expired on 1 March.
Hamas did not agree to a renegotiation of the ceasefire on Israel's terms, although it offered to release a living American hostage and four hostages' bodies as mediators tried to prolong the ceasefire.
Israel blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas. It accused Hamas of commandeering the provisions as part of its strategy against Israel, though did not provide evidence for this claim.
The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage. Twenty-five Israeli and five Thai hostages were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire.

Mr Grondeau was arrested in southern Iran in October 2022 and sentenced to five years in prison for ""conspiracy against the Islamic republic"". His family have always denied the charges.

His family have described him as a passionate fan of Persian poetry who had travelled to Iran on a tourist visa as part of a world tour.
Two other French citizens are currently being held in Iran.
Cecile Kohler, a teacher, and her partner, Jacques Paris, were detained in May 2022 and accused of seeking to stir up protests, which their families have denied.

They have been charged with espionage, with Iranian state media reporting they were being held in the south-eastern city of Kerman.

Alaa's wife lies in a body bag at his feet. She was just 20.
""We only got married two years ago,"" Alaa says. ""She was seven months pregnant when she was killed.""
Israel says it broke the ceasefire because Hamas was stalling for time over the release of Israeli hostages. It accuses Hamas of hiding behind civilians and of preparing to attack Israel again.
Israel's military does not allow foreign journalists uncontrolled access to Gaza. From Jerusalem I spoke to Dr Morgan McMonagle, an Irish trauma surgeon who is volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Gaza.
On Tuesday, the doctor says he worked flat out from 02:30 in the morning, when Israel's assault began, to late at night. He estimated 40% of the dead and injured he saw were children.
""All I can do is report as a simple humanitarian surgeon on the ground, there is a disproportionate number of children being injured and killed, and women,"" he says.
""And I think any reasonable person can see that it's disproportionate.""

""They used to play around, have fun, most of all they loved to ride with me on my tuktuk,"" Karam says with tears in his eyes.
""They wanted to be doctors, teachers.""
Israel says Hamas exaggerates the number of Palestinians who are killed and injured. But the United Nations views the Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health figures as reliable. Some experts believe the number of people killed in Gaza over the past 18 months of war has in fact been underestimated.
Dr McMonagle says he has no reason to believe the Ministry of Health figures are wrong.
""I try to avoid the propaganda because propaganda drives war… but I can tell you over 70 people (at Nasser Hospital) went straight to the mortuary yesterday, and many of them were children. I saw them.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops had moved in up to the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the Strip.
The renewed assault on Gaza marks the end of the fragile ceasefire deal that had been in place since January.
Earlier, the UN said two people - including one of its staff - had been killed after an explosion at its compound in Deir al-Balah.
A foreign ministry spokesman said it would launch an investigation, but denied Israel was to blame.
The IDF said it had begun ""targeted ground activities"" to create what it called a ""partial buffer between the north and south"" in Gaza.
The BBC has also seen evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military directing Gazans to leave a huge area along the three sides of the territory's land borders, suggesting that a larger ground operation could shortly take place.
The orders sent panic among Palestinian families, many of whom had been displaced repeatedly by the war and had returned home during the ceasefire.
Families have been seen carrying what they could and leaving by foot, by cart or vehicle, to seek safety away from the areas marked by the Israeli military.
In a video message on Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a ""last warning"" to the Palestinian territory calling for the return of the remaining hostages being held there.
Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.
Katz also repeated the call for the end of Hamas, saying if neither demands are met the alternative would be ""total destruction and devastation"".
The movement of troops comes after the UN said a member of staff had been killed when its compound in Deir al-Balah was damaged on Wednesday.
The UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said an ""explosive ordnance was dropped or fired"" at the building, which was in an ""isolated"" location. It added there was no confirmation on the nature of the incident or the type of artillery used.
The head of the UNOPS, Jorge Moreira da Silva, said: he believed ""this was not an accident"", adding that the situation in Gaza is ""unconscionable"".
UN Secretary General António Guterres has called for a full investigation.
On Tuesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had ""resumed combat in full force"" and any ceasefire negotiations would now take place ""under fire"".

BBC News","A ceasefire which had halted fighting between Israel and Hamas for two months appears to be over following an intense wave of air strikes by Israel on what it said were Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.
The ceasefire laid out a path for permanently ending the war, and had seen the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
The war was triggered when Hamas attacked on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as captives.
Israel responded with a massive military offensive, which killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.
Israeli aircraft began attacking what the military said were Hamas targets across Gaza in the early hours of 18 March. It was the most extensive series of air strikes since the ceasefire began on 19 January.
The Israeli military described the action as ""pre-emptive strikes... based on Hamas's readiness to execute terror attacks, build up force and re-arm"". At the same time, the Israeli prime minister's office said the action was ordered after Hamas's ""repeated refusal to release our hostages"" and its rejection of new ceasefire proposals by the US and mediators.
Hamas reacted furiously, accusing Israel of having ""decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement"".
The ceasefire has been under increasing strain for several weeks during which time indirect talks between Israel and Hamas about moving forward had reached an impasse.
It has not been declared over, though in practice the attacks by Israel mean the truce is no longer.
Mediators though - the US, Qatar and Egypt - which spent months brokering the ceasefire will almost certainly intensify efforts to salvage the agreement.
Israel, however, has warned its new offensive will ""continue as long as necessary, and will expand beyond air strikes"" - suggesting plans for renewed military action on the ground.
The Israeli prime minister's office said the attacks that begun on 18 March were being carried out ""in order to achieve the objectives of the war"". These have previously been declared as:
It is unclear, though, whether the statement means the military action will continue until such aims have been met, or whether it is part of a strategy to force Hamas to accept new ceasefire demands.
Although there was no fighting when Israel began its large-scale air attacks, both sides had repeatedly accused the other of breaking the ceasefire. It also happened at a time when the first phase of the ceasefire had expired and the second not yet begun.
Israel said it accepted new US plans to keep the ceasefire going, but Hamas said the proposals were unacceptable because it was not what had been agreed upon in the original truce.
The ceasefire was announced on 15 January and began four days later, after months of negotiations led by the US, Qatar and Egypt. It is based on a proposal set out by former US President Joe Biden in May 2024.
The deal involves three stages:
Stage one
This officially lasted for 42 days, during which:
Stage two
Negotiations on the second stage were meant to begin 16 days after the start of stage one - but this did not happen. Like stage one, stage two is also meant to be completed within 42 days.
According to the ceasefire deal, under stage two:
Stage three
The final part of the agreement would see:
Since 1 March, when stage one expired, the ceasefire has been in limbo.
Stage two has not begun, even though talks were meant to have started weeks ago.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 2 March that Israel had accepted a plan by US envoy Steve Witkoff ""to extend the temporary ceasefire by 50 days"" to discuss the second stage.
Netanyahu said that under the plan, half of the remaining hostages would be released straight away, and the remainder released if an agreement was reached.
Hamas said it rejected Israel's attempt to extend the first stage, calling it ""a blatant attempt to evade the agreement and avoid entering into negotiations for the second phase"".
The US - which has aligned itself more closely with Israel since Donald Trump succeeded Joe Biden - said Hamas was ""making a very bad bet that time is on its side. It is not.""
Israel says 59 hostages are still being held in Gaza, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive and at least 35 are presumed dead.
The 25 Israeli hostages released under the deal included female Israeli soldiers, male and female Israeli civilians, and two children. Five living Thai hostages were also freed outside of the deal.
The living hostages were released by Hamas in stage-managed events in different locations in Gaza, where they were handed over to the Red Cross.
The Red Cross then transferred them to Israeli forces inside Gaza, before they were driven across the border into Israel and reunited with their families. The freed hostages were then flown to hospitals for medical checks.
The bodies of four hostages were also handed over in a spectacle condemned by Israel and others. Four other bodies were returned without a similar event.
Around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza were released in the first phase of the deal.
Many of those released in the first exchange, and some in the following three exchanges, had never been charged and were detained without trial in Israeli prisons under what is called ""administrative detention"", a process widely criticised by human rights groups.
Others had been found guilty of serious crimes, including being convicted by Israeli courts of multiple murders. Dozens had been serving life sentences.
The released prisoners have returned to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and in some cases, Gaza. Dozens were deported abroad due to the gravity of their crimes.
Israel has insisted that no-one who was involved in the 7 October attacks will be freed.
The prisoners are among more than 10,000 Palestinians held by Israel (not including detainees from Gaza held by the Israeli military) who have either been convicted, or are suspected of ""security"" offences.
These range from bombings and other attacks, to belonging to banned armed groups.
More than 3,000 people are reported to be held under administrative detention.
Israel says 4,200 lorries carrying aid have entered Gaza each week since the ceasefire was agreed in mid-January.
Half of the supplies were destined for the north of Gaza, where aid had been hardest to deliver and food security experts had been warning of imminent famine.
But from 2 March, Israel stopped supplies being allowed into the territory.
Arab states and the UN condemned Israel's actions as a violation of the ceasefire agreement and against international law.
Aid agencies have managed to store supplies, which means there is no immediate danger to the civilian population. But the longer the ban lasts, the greater the pressure on making supplies last.
Gaza is home to an estimated 2.1 million Palestinians, almost all of whom had to leave their homes as Israel carried out continuous strikes across the territory and issued mass evacuation orders for large residential areas.
Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have returned home, but in many cases there is nothing to go back to, with whole streets and neighbourhoods standing in ruin.
Some 60% to 70% of buildings are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed.
The process is also fraught with danger, with Israeli and Hamas forces at a tense standoff, risks of unexploded ordnance, and warnings from the Israeli military to civilians to stay clear of military positions.
Rebuilding Gaza will be a monumental task. The UN has estimated it will cost at least $53bn (£41bn; €48.5bn), and it is likely to take decades.
The human cost of the conflict will also be felt for many years to come, with tens of thousands wounded and left with complex psychological damage.",Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrv2v4zg6o,British daughter of Gaza hostage says burying father 'incredibly meaningful',2025-03-16T20:54:58.827Z,"Lucy Manning
Special Correspondent","A British-Israeli woman whose father died in captivity after being taken hostage by Palestinian gunmen on 7 October has said the return of his body last month has been ""incredibly meaningful"".
""Bringing back my dad and being able to bury him was one of the most profound things,"" Sharone Lifschitz said, after the family were finally able to hold a funeral for 83-year-old Oded Lifshitz.
Both her father and her mother were taken hostage from their home by Palestinian gunmen, but while her 85-year-old mother, Yocheved, was released in late October 2023, Oded was held for 503 days.
When his body was returned in February the Israeli government said he had been murdered in captivity over a year earlier.
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said Oded ""was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization.""
""It's not the outcome we were hoping for,"" Sharone told the BBC on Sunday.
""But it's a relief to know that he is not suffering. We were so worried about his well being and his suffering, and he suffered before he died, and he died in the most horrific circumstances possible.""
Sharone spoke to BBC News at a memorial event at the JW3 Community Centre in London.
Hundreds of people came to pay their respects, including MPs, Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer, the Chief Rabbi and other British-Israeli families whose relatives were murdered on 7 October or taken hostage.
Sharone said that ""being able to say goodbye"" showed how important it was that all families were reunited with their relatives, both those still alive and the bodies Hamas is still holding.
The first phase of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas ended on 1 March and saw Hamas release 25 living Israeli hostages and eight dead hostages that it had captured during its attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.
In return, Israel released about 1,900 prisoners and detainees from Gaza.
Talks to extend the ceasefire and release more hostages have so far failed to reach an agreement.
""Receiving my father's remains back, and being able to say goodbye to him has really has been incredibly meaningful to me, more than I could ever imagine, to bring him back to us, away from such horrific events that he was part of in his last days,"" Sharone said.
""It's very hard to reconcile the fact we weren't there for him. But at least we know now that he is back with us. I hope he knows how much we love him.
""Experiencing what it is to close it, to know that my father is dead and buried, really brings to the fore how important it is to return everybody, the living and the dead hostages, so that all the families can bury their loved ones.""
She said he had been held alive and injured in Gaza for a few weeks after he was captured but that ""he didn't give up on his humanity.""
Hamish Falconer, Lincoln MP and a minister for the Middle East, said: ""It was important for me to be here and pay my respects for the tragic loss of Oded.
""Sharone is a pillar of strength and dignity and I could not admire her more. We must bring home all of those still held hostage, as she said, and as Oded would wish.""
Oded was a journalist and veteran campaigner for peace who drove sick Palestinians to hospitals in Israel for treatment. In his campaign for Palestinian rights he met Yasser Arafat, then head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Ever since 7 October Sharone, a filmmaker and academic, has campaigned vigorously for her parents release.
The BBC were with Sharone at her home in East London when the ceasefire deal was announced in January.
She shed tears of joy, hoping that she would finally discover the fate of her father, as after more than a year of him being held hostage she didn't know whether he was alive or dead.
Yocheved Lifshitz previously said that her husband was a great campaigner for peace. ""He had very good relations with Palestinians and the thing that hurt the most is that they betrayed him,"" she said.
Speaking to the BBC after her mother was released from captivity, Sharone said that Oded had ""spent his life in the peace movement and he fought for the possibility of both nations [Israelis and Palestinians] living side by side"".
At the memorial event on Sunday, Sharone said: ""I can't give up on peace in my own life. Therefore I cannot give up on peace on any other scale. Peace is where we want to be. Is the road long? Is the road hazardous? Yes. What's the alternative? More hate? Did hate ever solve hate? Does more hate help? I don't see it.""",Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5nlxz44yo,"Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?",2025-03-12T20:42:07.993Z,"Phil McCausland
BBC News
Reporting fromNew York","Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024, has drawn global attention after the Trump administration arrested and moved to deport him.
The case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.
Mr Khalil will remain in detention in Louisiana following a court hearing on Wednesday, where lawyers argued over whether he should be moved back to New York.
Born in Syria, the Columbia graduate's arrest by immigration agents was linked to President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of ""un-American activity"".
Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest ""the first of many to come"".
The 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of ""open repression of student activism and political speech"".
Born in Syria to Palestinian refugees, Mr Khalil earned a degree in computer science from the Lebanese American University before working with the Syrian-American non-profit Jusoor.
More recently, he managed the Syria Chevening Programme for the British Embassy in Beirut, offering scholarships for study in the UK, according to his biography on the Society for International Development website.
The UK Foreign Office said Mr Khalil stopped work there more than two years ago.
Mr Khalil moved to the US in 2022, where he earned a master's degree at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. He has since married an American woman, who is eight months pregnant, and initially faced arrest threats herself, according to his lawyer.
Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.
Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.
Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.
After Mr Khalil's arrest the Department of Homeland Security accused him of ""leading activities aligned to Hamas"" but did not provide further details.
On Tuesday, the White House alleged that he had organised protests where pro-Hamas propaganda was distributed. His lawyers responded that there was no evidence that he had provided support of any kind to US-designated terror groups.
""They're trying to make an example of him to chill others from making similar speech,"" Samah Sisay told the AP.
Some Jewish students at Columbia have said the protests veered into antisemitism and made them feel unsafe on campus.
The Columbia Jewish Alumni Association said Mr Khalil had ""spent over a year abusing the privileges this country and Columbia gave him"".
The Trump administration recently cut $400m in funding to the university over what it said was ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students"".
Students affiliated with Cuad and the protests have rejected these characterisations, and many Jewish students and groups participated in the campus rallies.
Columbia was just one college campus that played host to mass student protests over the war in Gaza. And activists say they fear the Trump administration will continue to target protesters who are not US citizens.
Legal experts say green card holders can be deported on national security grounds, but add that the case against Mr Khalil is unprecedented.
""Targeting individual protesters just for protesting... is highly unusual and something that we haven't seen before, even under the first Trump administration,"" said Jacob Hamburger, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell Law School.
Amid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.
At the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.
It is unclear when he obtained his green card, which provides permanent residency.
""[They said] that after reviewing the evidence, they don't have any evidence to suspend (me),"" he said in an interview in early May. ""It shows how random the suspension was … they did that randomly, and without due process.""
At the time he said he would continue protesting, but more recently, Mr Khalil's wife said her husband had grown worried about deportation, after facing online attacks that ""were simply not based in reality"". She said he sent Columbia University an email asking for urgent legal help on 7 March, the day before immigration agents arrested him.
Mr Khalil's arrest has sparked demonstrations in New York City, where Columbia is located. On Monday, hundreds of people gathered at a Manhattan protest, including students and professors from Columbia University.
Donna Lieberman, president of New York Civil Liberties Union, called the attempted deportation of Mr Khalil ""targeted retaliation and an extreme attack on the First Amendment"". New York Attorney General Letitia James said she was ""extremely concerned"".
The American Civil Liberties Union called the arrest ""unprecedented"" and ""obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate""
""The federal government is claiming the authority to deport people with deep ties to the US and revoke their green cards for advocating positions that the government opposes,"" it said.
The White House has continued to defend its move.
""This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organisations that have killed Americans,"" said Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary.",Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvemz7gmgzo,Palestinian comedian is 'proud and hurt' after making Netflix hit,2025-03-12T00:37:25.498Z,"Manish Pandey
BBC Newsbeat","Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.
Pride and hurt.
""It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,"" he tells BBC Newsbeat.
He is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.
The character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.
Making a show so closely tied to his life was ""very taxing"" because of ""the sheer amount of emotion"" involved.
""I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,"" Mo says.
There was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.
The final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.
That's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.
This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Avoiding 7 October in the storyline was ""very intentional"", Mo says.
The show is ultimately ""grounded in comedy"", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.
""You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,"" says Mo.
Mo says he wanted to keep the ""greater context"" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath ""almost insinuates this just started"".
""That couldn't be further from the truth,"" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.
There was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.
""That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.
""And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.""
The show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.
It tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.
From his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.
Mo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.
The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.
Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
Israel occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.
Palestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.
""I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,"" Mo says.
He adds it was ""not only Palestinians"" contacting him.
Mo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was ""almost like we filmed a movie"" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.
He says he wanted to cover ""the main strokes"", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.
""Immediately, you're not on vacation,"" he says. ""You're on edge, actually.""
Mo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.
""There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans… more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,"" he says.
""You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.""
Mo says he can't ""walk away"" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling ""like public property at this point"".
""I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,"" he says.
""Those that agree with me or disagree with me… it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.""
The ceasefire agreement in Gaza has provided some hope that there could be an end to fighting, but it has also felt fragile with concern that deal could collapse.
Mo says he is ""always hopeful"" things can get better.
""I never lose hope.
""If you do, then it becomes a really, really sad place whenever you're devoid of hope,"" he says.

BBC Middle East correspondent
Reporting fromBeirut, Lebanon","The violence of the last four days in Syria is the worst in the country since an Islamist-led rebel offensive toppled Bashar al-Assad in December, and the most serious challenge to the efforts of interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa to consolidate his power.
The post-Assad era started with high hopes and relative calm but, as Syria remains deeply fractured, many feared that an explosion of tensions was almost inevitable.
With the regime gone, putting an end of more than five decades of Assad family rule, rebels arrived in Damascus from Idlib, a region in Syria's north-west that for years was the only opposition-controlled province in the country.
The rebels were catapulted into positions once controlled by hand-picked Assad supporters and, led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), were in charge of a country devastated by 13 years of civil war.
The dismantling of the security apparatus behind the oppressive machine of the Assads, including the country's army and the ruling Baath party, meant the sacking of hundreds of thousands of people.
Among them were large numbers of the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which the Assad family belong. Under the Assads, they held prominent positions.
Now, under Sunni Muslim-led authorities, they have lost their power and privilege, and say they have been under attack and discrimination, despite Sharaa's pledges to respect different religious sects.
In January, just over a month after Assad's fall, I met a rebel around 30 years old who had recently been appointed as a high-profile security official.
In the nearly empty interior ministry headquarters in Damascus, he welcomed me to a room where any sign of the old regime had been removed.
Tall and shy, the official made notes on his iPad while acknowledging that the new rulers faced enormous challenges, including resistance by Assad loyalists. He requested anonymity to be able to discuss sensitive issues.
""There are Assad-affiliated people who haven't engaged with the reconciliation process,"" he said, citing the new authorities' call for former members of the security forces to surrender their weapons and ties to the old government.
""Our eyes are on everyone, but we don't want to give the impression that we're after them. That's why there haven't been massive raids.""
He also mentioned the threat from Sharaa's more radical supporters, who were frustrated with the pragmatic and conciliatory tone of a man who led al-Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate.
Syria's new leader has tried to convince everyone, especially in the West, that he is a reformed man and that his jihadist ideologies remain in the past.
""We recognise that this is a problem,"" the official said, adding: ""we're going to [have to] deal with it.""
For weeks, violence against government forces was on the rise, particularly in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous - the Alawite heartland and a stronghold for Assad supporters. An insurgency seemed to be growing but the clashes were relatively contained. Until Thursday.
As forces linked to the government carried out an operation in the countryside of Latakia, targeting a former Assad official, they were ambushed by gunmen in Jableh. A regional official described it as a well-planned attack carried out by ""remnants of the Assad militias"", with reports that about 4,000 men were involved.
To curb the rebellion, the authorities sent reinforcements, who were also joined by militias who were not necessarily responding to the orders from Damascus. The operation turned into revenge killings of a sectarian nature: after decades of brutality under the Assads in the mainly Sunni country, many associate Alawites with the old regime.
A widely shared video showed the bodies of at least two dozen men in civilian clothing, piled in the yard of a house, in the Alawite town of Mukhtareyah. Elsewhere, accounts emerged of fighters searching for Alawite members and killing entire families on the spot.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, more than 1,300 people have been killed in Latakia, Tartous, Hama and Homs provinces, a number that includes 973 civilians and hundreds of members of the Syrian security forces and Assad loyalists. The information could not be independently verified.
Sharaa's office announced the creation of an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings by both sides, saying that he would hold to account anyone who overstepped their authority. ""No-one will be above the law,"" he said in a video speech.
The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, said former Assad regime members were likely to form the most effective insurgent cells against Syria's new rulers with the ability to co-ordinate attacks.
""[They] already have pre-existing networks that they can leverage to rapidly organise insurgent cells. These networks are military, intelligence, and political networks and criminal syndicates who were regime supporters and lost significant economic and political influence in the aftermath of Assad's fall,"" a report said.
The bloodshed will add to the pressure on Sharaa, whose forces do not control the whole of Syria, and where myriad factions - supported by different countries - exercise power over different regions.
Turkish-backed groups are clashing with Kurdish forces that control large areas in north-east, while Israeli troops are occupying parts of the country's south-west. The authorities have also faced resistance from Druze forces in the south, although a deal was reached last week.
However, Sharaa's challenges go beyond the task of trying to keep the country safe. As Western suspicions over his intentions continue, the authorities are struggling to get crippling sanctions imposed on Syria under the former regime lifted, a vital move to revive the economy of a country where nine in every 10 people are in poverty. The recent violence will make those efforts even harder.",Middle East

BBC News","Yemen's rebel Houthi group has said it has fired a missile at Israel, which was intercepted.
The ballistic missile was fired toward Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, the group's military spokesperson said in a televised statement.
Sirens sounded in several areas of Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces said. No injuries have been reported and the IDF says the missile was stopped before entering Israel.
Meanwhile, Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency said Israeli strikes early on Thursday have killed at least 10 people.
Israel has extended its ground operations in Gaza, after launching a wave of air strikes that the Hamas-run health ministry says killed more than 430 people in two days.
The air strikes on Thursday reportedly targeted six homes east of Khan Younis, a spokesman for the Hamas-run civil defence agency said, and also injured dozens of people.
""A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF prior to crossing into Israeli territory. Sirens were sounded in accordance with protocol,"" the Israeli military said in a statement, referring to its air force.
The Houthi group have vowed to retaliate, including against Israel, after the US carried out deadly strikes against them in recent days.
The Iranian-backed rebel group, which considers Israel its enemy, controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally recognised government.
The Houthis said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
US President Donald Trump has warned Iran that it will face ""dire"" consequences if Yemen's Houthis continue to attack international shipping lanes.
The Pentagon said it had struck 30 targets in Yemen since Saturday, in the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump returned to the White House.
The Houthi group first tried to attack the USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea on Sunday following deadly US strikes on Yemen.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops had moved in up to the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the Gaza Strip.
The renewed assault on Gaza marks the end of the fragile ceasefire deal that had been in place since January.
Earlier, the UN said two people - including one of its staff - had been killed after an explosion at its compound in Deir al-Balah.
The 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel saw about 1,200 people killed and the capturing of 251 hostages - 25 of whom were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire.
Israel responded with a massive military offensive, which has killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says, as well as causing large-scale destruction to homes and infrastructure.",Middle East

BBC News","The UN says that one of its workers has been killed and others injured after a compound in Gaza was damaged on Wednesday, adding that the circumstances of the incident remain unclear.
The Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry blamed an Israeli strike and said five critically injured foreign workers had arrived in hospital. Israel's military denied striking the UN compound in Deir al-Balah.
It comes after Israel said it was resuming fighting in Gaza following a two-month ceasefire - launching a wave of strikes that killed more than 400 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.
On Tuesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had ""resumed combat in full force"".
A day later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was extending ground operations in Gaza up to the Netzarim corridor, which divides the north and south of the strip.
Troops moved into the area ""to create a partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza"", the military added.
The UN initially said two of its workers had been killed but later clarified that the second person was not a staff member.
The UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said an ""explosive ordnance was dropped or fired"" at the building, which was in an ""isolated"" location.
It added there was no confirmation on the nature of the incident or the type of artillery used.
UNOPS executive director Jorge Moreira da Silva described the incident as ""not an accident"" and added that ""UN personnel and its premises must be protected by all sides"".
In a statement, a spokesperson for UN Secretary General António Guterres said two guesthouses were hit and called for a full investigation.
Footage verified by the BBC showed injured people - two still wearing blue UN flak jackets - arriving at a hospital in an ambulance and a UN car.
Separately, at least 20 people were killed in air strikes across Gaza overnight, after Israel said it was resuming fighting in the Palestinian territory.
Two civilians were killed and five others injured when an Israeli drone hit a tent near the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reports, citing Red Crescent medics.
Israel's army said it had targeted what it called a Hamas military site, from where the group was preparing to fire into Israel. Vessels controlled by Hamas were also hit, the army said.
The bombing is not of the same scale as it was on Tuesday - but it shows no let-up in Israel's fresh assault.
Tom Fletcher, the UN's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, said of Tuesday's strikes that ""the intensity of the killings is now off the scale"".
Wafa says a woman and child were killed in an air strike north of Khan Younis overnight into Wednesday, while four others were killed in a strike in Gaza City.
Gaza's health ministry said that 436 people had been killed in strikes since Tuesday, including 183 children.
Tuesday's strikes constituted the heaviest bombardment since a fragile ceasefire and hostage exchange deal came into effect on 19 January, and came after Israel and Hamas failed to agree how to take it beyond an initial phase.
The deal involves three stages, and negotiations on the second stage were meant to have started six weeks ago - but this did not happen.
Under the proposed second phase, Israel would withdraw troops from Gaza - but Israel and the US instead pushed for an extension of the first phase, with more hostages being released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.
Netanyahu cast the resumption of fighting as a return to Israel's primary aims - to return the hostages and ""get rid"" of Hamas - but families of hostages have criticised the decision, saying it showed the government had given up on their loved ones.
Thousands of Israelis have joined a protest in Jerusalem, accusing Netanyahu of undermining democracy and restarting the offensive in Gaza without regard for the hostages.
Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.
Egypt, a mediator in talks, said the fresh strikes were a ""blatant"" violation of the ceasefire.
Israel previously imposed a total halt on all humanitarian aid entering Gaza, causing widespread international alarm.
""For two weeks now, our food supplies are rotting at the borders, the medicines are expiring, the water's been cut off, the power's been cut off - and all that to punish civilians further,"" Mr Fletcher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
He said he had spoken to the UN security council on Tuesday in a bid to lift the blockade and get the ceasefire deal back on track, including the release of hostages.
""I'm not asking for the moon here,"" the UN chief added.
He said his team would ""carry on going"" in Gaza because they are ""determined to do everything they can to save as many survivors as possible.
""They're saying to us: What does it say about our values that we can't stop a 21st Century atrocity happening before our eyes - and not just happening, but being cheered on before our eyes?""
Hamas has confirmed that several of its leaders were killed in Tuesday's strikes, including its de facto head of government, Essam a-Da'lees.
Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad - whose fighters participated in the 7 October 2023 attack which triggered the current conflict - said the prominent spokesman of its armed wing, known as Abu Hamza, was killed.
However, there were also many civilians, including dozens of children, thought to be among the dead.
Regional mediators are now said to be pushing Hamas to release some of the Israeli hostages it still holds in exchange for a de-escalation.
But Netanyahu has said that going forward, all ceasefire talks will take place ""under fire"".
The 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel saw about 1,200 people killed and the capturing of 251 hostages - 25 of whom were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire.
Israel responded with a massive military offensive, which has killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says, as well as causing large-scale destruction to homes and infrastructure.",Middle East

BBC News","Israel has ""resumed combat in full force"" against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday night.
In a defiant video statement, he warned that ""negotiations will continue only under fire"" and that ""this is just the beginning"".
His comments came after Israeli aircraft launched massive airstrikes against what the military said were Hamas targets in Gaza.
More than 400 people have been killed in the attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry said, and hundreds more injured.
The wave of strikes was the heaviest since a ceasefire began on 19 January.
The fragile truce had mostly held until now, but this new wave of attacks suggests plans for a permanent end to the war may be off the table.
The airstrikes which hit Beit Lahia, Rafah, Nuseirat and Al-Mawasi on Tuesday shattered the relative peace that Gazans had been experiencing since January, and hospitals are once again overrun with casualties.
The attacks on Gaza have been condemned by Egypt, a mediator in the talks.
The air strikes are ""a blatant violation"" of the ceasefire agreement and represent ""a dangerous escalation"", said Tamim Khallaf, the spokesman for the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
""I was shocked that the war started again, but at the same time, this is what we expect from the Israelis,"" Hael a resident from Jabalia al-Balad told BBC Arabic.
""As a citizen, I'm exhausted. We've had enough - a year-and-a-half to this! It's enough,"" he added.
Key Hamas figures were killed in the airstrikes, including Major General Mahmoud Abu Watfa, deputy interior minister in Gaza and the highest-ranking Hamas security official.
In his address, Netanyahu said Israel had tried to negotiate with Hamas to release the Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza. He accused Hamas of rejecting the proposals every time.
Israel and Hamas have disagreed on how to take the ceasefire deal forward since the first phase expired in early March, after numerous exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.
The deal involves three stages, and negotiations on the second stage were meant to have started six weeks ago - but this did not happen.
Instead, the agreement was thrown into uncertainty when the US and Israel wanted to change the terms of the deal, to extend stage one which would see more hostages released.
That would have delayed the start of phase two, which was meant to establish a permanent ceasefire and required Israeli troops to pull out of Gaza.
But Hamas rejected this proposed change to the agreement brokered by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, calling it unacceptable.
On Tuesday evening, Netanyahu said Israel would continue to fight to achieve all of its war goals - ""to return the hostages, get rid of Hamas and make sure Hamas is not a threat to Israel.""
US President Donald Trump's administration was consulted by Israel before it carried out the strikes, officials said.
The US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said: ""Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire, but instead chose refusal and war.""
Hamas warned the resumption of violence by Israel would ""impose a death sentence"" on the remaining living hostages held in Gaza, and accused Israel of trying to force it into a surrender.
Speaking to the BBC about the attacks, Dr Sabrina Das, an obstetrician training Palestinian doctors in southern Gaza, said: ""It was all very sudden… everybody's mood was just shattered because we knew it was the start of the war again.""
Dr Das said her colleagues in Nasar hospital were ""up all night operating"" because ""mass casualties had started coming in again"".
Mohammed Zaquot, director general of the Gaza Strip's hospitals, told BBC Arabic ""the attacks were so sudden that the number of medical staff available was inadequate for the scale of these large strikes, and additional teams were called in immediately to assist"".
A group representing hostages' families has accused the Israeli government of choosing ""to give up the hostages"" by launching new strikes - and has been protesting outside the Israeli parliament.
The news of the strikes terrified some of the families of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas.
""The Israeli government is not perfect, and Israel is not doing enough, because my brothers are not home"", Liran Berman, whose twin brothers are still being held in Gaza, told the BBC.
""But if Hamas wanted, the hostages would be back. They are in their hands.""
Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.
The war was triggered when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as captives.

BBC News, Jerusalem","Israeli fighter jets unleashed a wave of bombardment across the Gaza Strip through the night, ripping into a fragile truce that has mostly held since it came into effect in January.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu overnight laid the blame at Hamas's door for the renewal of his deadly aerial campaign.
The Israeli leader's statement said the military have been instructed to take ""strong action"" against Hamas following their ""repeated refusal to release our hostages"" as well as its rejection of US proposals.
In local press, Israeli military sources have also talked about seeing an increase of Hamas activity to regroup their forces in recent days.
While the truce mostly held until last night, officials at the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza have said that over 140 people have been killed by Israel in the two months since it came into effect in January.
In recent weeks, the Israel military has said it's repeatedly struck targets they've identified as Hamas fighters posing a threat to its troops stationed in Gaza.
But the reasons for Netanyahu's decision to return to attacking Hamas is a subject of contention.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has accused the government of ""a complete deception"" by pulling out of a deal ""that could have brought everyone home.""
While some of the prime minister's most staunch critics suggest that the attacks are an attempt by Netanyahu to distract from damaging legal and political crises he faces closer to home.
Most critically, there is a fundamental dispute between the Israeli and Hamas sides about who is to blame for the failure of recent efforts to progress the ceasefire.
The 19 January ceasefire deal was thrashed out over many months, with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation, and a detailed three-phase plan for how the truce should move forward.
The first phase saw Hamas release 33 hostages in return for Israel releasing around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and allowing aid and other goods to enter the Gaza Strip.
As the guns fell silent and thousands of displaced Gazans returned home, Hamas and Israel were due to begin negotiations to commence the second phase.
The parties had agreed that the second phase negotiations would include the release of all remaining hostages as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza Strip, leading to a permanent end to the war.
The first phase finished on 1 March, but the negotiations for the next stage had made no progress.
Instead, Israel imposed a total halt on all aid entering Gaza causing widespread international alarm - and said that it backed a new proposal put together by the United States.
In Qatar last week, Israeli and Hamas delegations gathered to negotiate how the ceasefire would progress and US envoy Steve Witkoff put forward his new ""bridging proposal"" that would have extended the expired first phase.
More hostages would return home in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners being released - but, crucially, negotiations over a permanent end to the war would be delayed.
Here lies a central element to why the truce has broken down.
Israel's two key objectives - to return the hostages and to defeat Hamas - aren't both fully achievable together.
Hamas, to put it crudely, has one card to play in the negotiations: the hostages. They don't want to release any further hostages in a next stage of the ceasefire unless it entails Israeli troops beginning to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, as agreed in the original truce.
Israel is resisting this. The new, US proposal is an attempt to retrieve more hostages while delaying a commitment to ending the war and the question over whether Hamas will remain in some form.
In recent days, the US and Israel have cast Hamas's preference for sticking close to the terms of the original ceasefire deal - instead of renegotiating its terms - as a ""refusal"" to extend the ceasefire.
Witkoff accused Hamas of ""publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.""
While, in late February, Israeli officials had already briefed local press that its military wouldn't withdraw from key sites in Gaza in a breach of the ceasefire agreement.
While we cannot know the detail of the negotiation talks that have taken place behind closed doors - what we do know is that Israel halting aid entering Gaza 17 days ago was an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions.
That hasn't worked so far and now it appears Israel has returned to violence in order to try to extract a new deal, one that is more favourable for its political leaders, and one that offers fewer wins to Hamas.
From now on, the situation in Gaza is likely to look different to the past two months of the truce.
This morning the Israeli military has published a map, ordering Palestinians to leave a huge area along the perimeter of the Gaza Strip, where no doubt thousands of Gazans had returned to.
Hamas, for its part, has called for a halt to Israel's military operation and, at the time of writing, has not said it will return to fighting.
However, a BBC journalist near the Israel Gaza border today was told by a soldier that a call has gone out for 40,000 reservists to the Israeli army to present for duty. This seems to confirm reports in Israeli press that the military has been preparing for a renewed ground invasion in the Gaza Strip.
Pursuing a renewed campaign in Gaza also presents a political boon for Prime Minister Netanyahu. This morning the hard right Jewish Power party has announced it will return to the coalition, its members including, former minister Itamar Ben Gvir, resigned in protest over the ceasefire. Having their cooperation will be crucial for the government as it seeks to pass its current budget.
Israel's operations last night may have been a one-off attempt to force Hamas to concede at the negotiating table. It may, however, also herald the beginning of a fierce wave of fighting on the ground again, alarming Gaza's weary families and concerned Israeli hostage families alike.",Middle East

BBC News","It had started as a normal night in Gaza, with people up already having their pre-dawn meal in the holy month of Ramadan. After 50 nights of ceasefire, life in the territory had settled into a relative rhythm of calm.
But then the rat-a-tat of gunfire began, and explosions. Then came the sound of people screaming.
Essam Abu Odeh and his family had been sleeping when the war planes came again.
""Around 02:00 [midnight GMT], we were suddenly awakened by the sounds of heavy shelling,"" he told the BBC's Gaza radio service.
""My daughter woke me up, warning me about the bombs. We quickly took shelter against the walls, fearing that rubble might fall on us.""
Israel's planes tore in from the north to sweep across the strip, striking Gaza City in the centre and then targets further south in Rafah and Khan Younis.
The blitz on Monday night killed more than 400 people, mostly women and children, local health authorities run by Hamas said. They did not identify the number of combatants killed - Israel says it targeted Hamas commanders.
More than 600 more are injured. Once again, hospitals in the territory were inundated, doctors on night shift battling a sudden influx of injured, many of them children.

The BBC met the family of one injured man, Ahmad Mo'in al-Jumla, at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. He had been at the Beach refugee camp in al-Ahrar when it was hit.
""We were shocked this area was targeted,"" says his sister, noting they couldn't find him at first.
""From the night until morning, we couldn't figure out if he was injured or not, because the scene was horrific, and no one had any news - the entire building had collapsed on everyone in that area.""
At 05:00, they pulled him out from under the rubble. He was alive - but was rushed to hospital with fractures and a brain injury.
His family too endured their own ordeal when their neighbourhood was hit. ""Suddenly, we found the house collapsing on us, rubble falling from every direction,"" his sister said.
""We tried to get out, we wanted to escape but there was nothing. It was night and suddenly there was bombing on the house.""
""The war resumed abruptly, without warning,"" says another Gaza resident M.
He was getting up for his Suhoor, or pre-dawn meal, when his street was struck by gunfire and shelling.
""A sense of terror swept through the area,"" he says. ""Everyone was filled with fear - unsure of where to go or if we could be displaced again.""
""Fear has once again gripped the people, especially as we are in the month of Ramadan,"" he said.
Israel pounded Gaza throughout the morning, the strikes easing as the sun came up.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the attacks, his office said, after Hamas failed to release more hostages or accept US proposals for extending a ceasefire that had held since late January.
Since the first phase of the ceasefire had come to an end earlier this month, there had been fears of the fighting resuming again - especially as talks stalled two days ago.
The White House on Monday night was briefed by Israel before they resumed their attacks.
But those living in Gaza were blindsided. The return of the warplanes shattered what had been two months of a fragile peace.
""I was shocked that the war started again, but at the same time, this is what we expect from the Israelis,"" Hael a resident from Jabalia al-Balad told BBC Arabic.
""We were not surprised; we expect this at any moment,"" he says about the truce's collapse. ""But the shock is enormous - 200 martyrs [people killed] in moments. As a citizen, I'm exhausted. We've had enough - a year-and-a-half to this! It's enough"", he said.
Before the ceasefire in late January, the war had gone on for 15 months with Israeli airstrikes and bombardments killing more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza.
Umm Mohammed Abou Aisha, living in Deir al-Balah in the east, had managed to survive with her mother throughout that period.
But her mother was killed on Tuesday morning. Her last memory is of her entering the kitchen, saying she wanted to make her morning meal.
""My mother woke up as usual to prepare her Suhoor meal, getting ready to fast but not ready for fighting,"" she told Reuters news agency.
The strike hit their neighbour's home, blasting the vicinity, she said.
She has questioned the state of the supposed peace. ""Life is getting harder, there is no truce or ceasefire.""
""There are snipers [stationed] daily in front of the citizens, continuous strikes. There is nothing of what was agreed upon [in the ceasefire].
Another resident, Mohammed Bdeir, said his daughter was killed - their street was bombed as the whole family was sleeping.
""[We] suddenly woke up on the strike, they hit our neighbours… we found this girl beneath the rubble, we pulled her mother and father from under the rubble.""
He then found his daughter's body there too, he told AFP news agency.
South-east of Gaza City, Ramez Alammarin, 25, described carrying children to a hospital.
""They unleashed the fire of hell again on Gaza,"" he told AFP, adding that ""bodies and limbs are on the ground, and the wounded cannot find any doctor to treat them"".
Hospital authorities in Gaza have told the BBC many patients being carried in are suffering severe head injuries and bleeding, burns, fractures.
""The attacks were so sudden that the number of medical staff was inadequate for the scale of these large strikes,"" said Dr. Mohammed Zaqout, Director General of Gaza Strip's hospitals.
He notes there are only seven hospitals able to operate across the territory at the moment, after 15 months of war. And despite the truce, few medical supplies had been allowed into Gaza.
Another doctor described the situation as catastrophic. There's a severe shortage of medical and surgical equipment, intensive care beds, medications.
""Even the medical staff have been completely exhausted after more than a year-and-a-half of continuous emergency work,"" said Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya.
""We have seen many wounded people lose their lives right in front of us simply because there are no medical supplies or any possible way to offer them care.""
He called Israel's actions at dawn a ""massacre against sleeping civilians in the Gaza Strip"".
The most admissions so far have been at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis in the south. People were rushing stretchers with the wounded to the hospital.
Bodies covered in white sheets were also taken to the hospital's mortuary. Families were gathering for funerals in the street.
Essam, the father woken by his young daughter this morning, says he's begging mediating countries to bring an end to their suffering.

Mahmoud Abu Wafah, deputy interior minister in Gaza and the territory's highest-ranking Hamas security official, is among the dead. Four other senior officials were later reported killed.
This is the largest wave of air strikes in Gaza since the ceasefire began on 19 January. Talks to extend it have failed to reach an agreement.
Many people were having their pre-dawn meal, part of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when explosions started in Gaza, witnesses say.
They described a nightmarish situation, with fires and bodies everywhere, and wounded people desperate for treatment.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz ordered the strikes on Tuesday morning, a statement from the prime minister's office said.
""This follows Hamas's repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators.""
""Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,"" it added.
Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages - all but one who were taken on 7 October 2023. Twenty-four of the hostages are believed to still be alive.
Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, warned Hamas to release all the hostages, stating ""we will show no mercy on our enemies"".
But a group representing hostages' families said the Israeli government ""chose to give up the hostages"".
The statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed shock and anger at what it called the ""deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones"".
The group later gathered for a protest outside the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem, calling on the government to bring the hostages home. Some called for an end to the war and Netanyahu's resignation.

She woke up to the sound ""of very, very loud explosions, our guest house was shaking. For the next 15 minutes... we heard explosions almost every five or six seconds"".
She described hearing yelling and sirens outside, as the sound of planes continued overhead.
Officials said the health system was struggling to cope with the number of injured, which the Hamas-run health ministry put at more than 660. Twenty-five out of 38 hospitals in the region are out of service, the ministry says.
Mohammed Zaquot, director general of the Gaza Strip's hospitals, told BBC Arabic the injured included people with burns and fractures, with many still waiting for surgery.
""The attacks were so sudden that the number of medical staff available was inadequate for the scale of these large strikes, and additional teams were called in immediately to assist,"" he says.
UN officials have condemned the strikes.
The Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Muhannad Hadi, said: ""This is unconscionable. A ceasefire must be reinstated immediately. People in Gaza have endured unimaginable suffering.""
Hamas responded furiously to the bombardment, accusing Israel of treachery over the ceasefire. It also said Israel had exposed the remaining hostages to ""an unknown fate"".
But Hamas has not yet declared that it is resuming the war, instead calling on mediators and the United Nations to intervene.
US President Donald Trump's administration was consulted by Israel prior to carrying out the strikes, officials said.
In a brief statement to US media, National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said that ""Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war"".
Trump has not yet commented directly on the strikes.
Negotiators have been trying to find a way forward after the first phase of the temporary truce ended on 1 March.

BBC News","The US has launched a ""decisive and powerful"" wave of air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, President Donald Trump has said, citing the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as the reason.
""Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,"" Trump said on social media, adding that their ""piracy, violence, and terrorism"" had cost ""billions"" and put lives at risk.
The Houthi-run health ministry said at least 31 people were killed and 101 others were injured in the strikes.
The group later said it would continue to target Red Sea shipping until Israel lifted its blockade of Gaza, and that its forces would respond to the strikes.
The Houthis reported a series of explosions on Saturday evening in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and in the northern province of Saada - the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.
The Iranian-backed rebel group, which considers Israel its enemy, controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally recognised government.
Unverified images show plumes of black smoke over the area of Sanaa's airport - which includes a military facility.
In a statement, the Houthis blamed the US and the UK for ""wicked"" aggression targeting residential areas in Sanaa.
The UK did not participate in Saturday's US strikes against the Houthi targets but it did provide routine refuelling support for the US.
The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.
Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.
These attacks, Trump said, ""will not be tolerated"".
He added: ""We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.""
The Houthis have not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels, or by multiple rounds of US and British air strikes on its military targets.
Israel has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since July, in retaliation to the 400 missiles and drones that the Israeli military said had been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which were shot down.
Major shipping companies have been forced to stop using the Red Sea - through which almost 15% of global seaborne trade usually passes - and use a much longer route around southern Africa instead.
Trump said that it had been more than a year since a US-flagged ship had sailed safely through the Suez Canal - which the Red Sea leads to - and four months since a US warship had been through the body of water between east Africa and the Arabian peninsula.
The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe, and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Addressing the Houthis directly, Trump wrote that if they did not stop, ""HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE"".
But the Houthis were unwavering in their response, saying the aggression would not diminish their support for Palestinians.
""This aggression will not go without response and our Yemeni armed forces are ready to answer escalation with further escalation,"" the group said.
Trump urged Iran to cease its support for the Houthis, warning that Washington would hold Tehran ""fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it"".
He also accused the previous White House administration, under Joe Biden, of being ""pathetically weak"" and allowing the ""unrestrained Houthis"" to keep going.
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the US government had ""no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy"".
""End support for Israeli genocide and terrorism,"" he posted on X on Sunday. ""Stop killing of Yemeni people.""
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also discussed military deterrence operations against the Houthis when he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday.
Rubio emphasised that ""continued Houthi attacks on US military and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea will not be tolerated"", a State Department spokesperson said.
Lavrov, for his part, stressed the need for ""an immediate cessation of the use of force"" and the ""importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue in order to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed"", said the Russian foreign ministry.",Middle East

BBC News","Talks to extend the Gaza ceasefire have failed to reach an agreement, a Palestinian official has told the BBC, as the US accused Hamas of making ""entirely impractical"" demands at meetings in Qatar.
Negotiators have been trying to find a way forward after the first phase of the temporary truce ended on 1 March.
The US proposed to extend the first phase until mid-April, including a further exchange of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
But the Palestinian official familiar with the talks, who did not wished to be named, said Israel and Hamas disagreed over key aspects of the deal set out by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the indirect talks.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel was prepared to continue negotiations with Hamas on extending the ceasefire in Gaza.
The comments came after Netanyahu met top aides and security officials. His office said the decision was a response to what Israel had heard from mediators on US proposals for 11 living Israeli hostages to be released, and the bodies of half of the deceased hostages.
The White House accused Hamas of making ""entirely impractical"" demands in its response to Witkoff's proposal.
It would extend the ceasefire into April but delay the negotiation of a permanent end to the war.
A statement from Witkoff's office and the US National Security Council on Friday said: ""Hamas is making a very bad bet that time is on its side. It is not.""
""Hamas is well aware of the deadline, and should know that we will respond accordingly if that deadline passes.""
A Hamas statement seen by the BBC said negotiations had broken down.
Netanyahu's office had earlier said Israel accepted the US proposal.
It said Hamas remained ""firm in its refusal and has not budged a millimetre,"" accusing the group of ""manipulation and psychological warfare"".
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal involving three stages in January, after 15 months of war.
In the first stage, Hamas returned 25 living Israeli hostages, the remains of eight others, and five living Thai hostages. Israel released about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in exchange.
The deal says stage two will include the remaining living hostages in Gaza exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners.
But both sides currently disagree on the number of hostages due to be released next.
They also disagree on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, which the original deal states should be happening by now.
Israel resists this point, while Hamas insists it should happen.
Earlier in March, Israel blocked aid shipments to Gaza and then cut electricity, saying it aimed to put pressure on Hamas.
It is believed that Hamas is still holding up to 24 living hostages in Gaza and the remains of 35 others.
As indirect talks continued on Friday, the group said in a statement it was ready to release the last living Israeli-American hostage it is known to be holding.
Edan Alexander, 21, was serving as an Israeli soldier close to Gaza when he was taken.
Under the terms of the original ceasefire agreement, it was expected that he would have been among the last hostages to be released.
The group also said it would hand over the remains of four other dual nationals captured during the 7 October 2023 attacks.
It did not give further details or make clear what it would demand in return.
Witkoff dismissed the offer, saying Hamas was trying to appear flexible in public while being impractical in private.
The attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, with 251 taken hostage.
The assault triggered an Israeli military offensive that has since killed more than 48,520 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry which are used by the UN and others.
Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times.
An estimated 70% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, healthcare, water, and sanitation systems have collapsed and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

The charity said eight people - including its volunteers and independent journalists documenting their activities - were killed when their vehicles were targeted on Saturday in what Hamas described as a ""blatant violation"" of the ceasefire agreement with Israel.
The Israeli military has said it had struck ""two terrorists who were identified operating a drone that posed a threat to Israeli troops"", adding that it then targeted ""additional terrorists"" who arrived at the scene.
The charity rejects the allegation that members of its team were terrorists.
Qasim Rashid Ahmad, founder and chairman of the charity, told the BBC the team was in the area to set up tents and document it for the charity's own promotion efforts.
He said that the cameramen came back to the car and were hit, while its team members who rushed to the scene were then struck by an Israeli drone which had followed them when they went to the charity's second car.
But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted people operating a drone who posed a threat to Israeli troops in Beit Lahia, adding: ""Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists.""
Video editor Bilal Abu Matar and cameramen Mahmoud Al-Sarraj, Bilal Aqila and Mahmoud Asleem were all named as having been killed in the strike, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate.
The organisation accused Israel of carrying out ""systematic targeting of Palestinian journalists, who risk their lives to report the truth and expose Israeli crimes to the world"".
Several others were injured in the strike, and rushed to the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run health ministry said.
A spokesman for the group, Hazem Qassem, accused Israel of having ""committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip"".
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been in place since January, after 15 months of fighting, but its future is uncertain as the process has reached an impasse.
The first phase of the multi-stage deal saw Hamas return dozens of hostages, both alive and dead, that it had captured during its attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Talks to extend the first phase of the ceasefire - which ended on 1 March - ended without an agreement, a Palestinian official told the BBC on Saturday.
Negotiators were working on a US-proposed extension, which would include a further exchange of hostages and prisoners.
Washington accused Hamas of making ""entirely impractical"" demands. The group has demanded immediate talks on the second phase, including discussions of a permanent ceasefire, as laid out in the agreement brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US in January.
Hamas's unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October 2023 saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages.
Israel responded with a massive military offensive on the Palestinian territory, which has killed more than 48,300 people, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.",Middle East

BBC News","A senior Islamic State (IS) group leader in Iraq and Syria has been killed in an operation by members of the Iraqi national intelligence service along with US-led coalition forces, the Iraqi prime minister has said.
Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rifai, also known as Abu Khadijah, ""was considered one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world"", according to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.
US President Donald Trump said ""he was relentlessly hunted down by our intrepid warfighters"".
The US Central Command (Centcom) said it conducted a ""precision airstrike"" in Iraq's western Al Anbar province, which killed ""one of the most important"" IS members on Thursday.
Rifai was the head of IS's most senior decision-making body and was responsible for operations, logistics, and planning conducted by IS globally, the US Central Command said.
He also directed a large portion of finance for the group's global organisation, Centcom added.
Posting on his Truth Social platform, President Trump said: ""His miserable life was terminated, along with another member of ISIS, in coordination with the Iraqi Government and the Kurdish Regional Government. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!""
Rifai was found dead alongside one other IS operative, Centcom said.
""Both terrorists were wearing unexploded 'suicide vests' and had multiple weapons,"" it added.
Centcom and Iraqi forces were able to identify him through a DNA match from DNA collected on a previous raid where he ""narrowly escaped"", it added.
Gen Michael Erik Kurilla said Rifai ""was one of the most important IS members in the entire global IS organisation.
""We will continue to kill terrorists and dismantle their organizations that threaten our homeland and US, allied and partner personnel in the region and beyond.""
IS once held 88,000sq km (34,000sq miles) of territory stretching from north-eastern Syria across northern Iraq and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people.
Iraq declared the defeat of IS in December 2017 and the group was driven from its last piece of territory in 2019.
However militants and sleeper cells continue to have a presence in various parts of the country and carry out sporadic attacks against Iraq's army and police.",Middle East

Middle East Correspondent
Reporting fromOccupied Golan Heights","Early on Friday morning, a group of Syrian men crossed into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights through a UN-monitored buffer zone.
With no diplomatic relations between Syria and Israel, Syrians crossing here would normally risk being shot or arrested.
This visit, by religious leaders from Syria's Druze minority, signals the dramatic changes in Israel's strategy along this frontier and its expanding military control of Syrian territory, in a direct challenge to the new government in Damascus.
It's the first time in five decades that Druze leaders have crossed from Syria into Israeli-controlled territory to visit Druze religious sites and communities here.
The buffer zone they crossed was set up in a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria after the 1973 War, when Israel occupied – and later annexed – Syrian territory in the Golan Heights.
Last December, following the fall of the former Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, Israel moved troops into the buffer zone, in contravention of the ceasefire agreement which bans the presence of any military forces or equipment from either side.
Israel has now established military outposts in the zone, including on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, or Jabal al-Sheikh, the area's highest peak. Israeli military correspondents say nine such posts have been set up since December, with Israel's defence minister, Yisrael Katz, saying that his forces were ""preparing to stay in Syria for an indefinite period"".
Israel has also carried out repeated incursions into southern Syria – up to 15km (nine miles) beyond the buffer zone, according to Israeli military correspondents – and has warned that it would act against any Syrian government forces or other armed groups who enter Syrian provinces south of Damascus.
Mr Katz said this week that the Israeli airforce had bombed 40 targets in southern Syria in a single night – part of what Israel says is a bombing campaign to destroy weapons stores and military equipment it fears could fall into the hands of its enemies.
The southern provinces of Syria, which run along the frontier with Israel, are home to many of Syria's Druze – Arabs who practice a variant of Shia Islam – whose community stretches across Syria, Israel and Lebanon.
Druze in Syria have watched over the past three months, as Israeli forces have moved in and out of their villages.
Their compliance is crucial to Israel's security goals. And Israel has made their protection a key justification for its military strategy.
Earlier this month, after clashes in Jaramana, south of Damascus, Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mr Katz instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to prepare to defend the Druze community there, and ""deliver a sharp and clear warning message: if the regime harms the Druze, it will be harmed"".
""We are obligated to our Druze brothers in Israel to do everything to prevent harm to their Druze brothers in Syria, and will take all the necessary steps to maintain their safety,"" the statement said, describing Syria's new government as a ""terrorist regime of extreme Islam"".
Israel has been loudly proclaiming the risks it says minorities like the Druze face from Syria's new leaders.
But not all Druze – on either side of the frontier – accept that's the real reason for Israel's military presence there.
""This story that they want to protect the Druze, we don't believe in it,"" said Nabi al-Halabi, a Druze activist in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. ""The main issue is that Israel wants to secure its border,"" he told me. ""The border is the main thing, not us.""
Israel is also offering sweeteners along with its new military incursions. The visit by religious leaders across the frontier this week is one. Aid to Druze communities in Syria is another. And Israel has also promised that Syrian agricultural and construction workers will be able to cross into the Golan Heights for work.
There's also the promise of new education funding for Druze living in the Golan – a reminder of Israel's investment in the territory it annexed in 1981.
It won't have escaped attention on either side of the frontier that Syria's new president al-Sharaa has his family roots in the Golan.
While Sunni Syrians fled after the 1973 war, some Druze stayed on and formed close ties to Israel, serving in the army and even taking Israeli citizenship.
Despite his familial roots in the occupied Golan Heights, Syria's new interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa has not so far broached the issue of Israel's annexation of Syrian territory since 1973, instead demanding that Israel withdraw from its most recent incursions into the buffer zone and beyond.
His government has also drawn up a 12-point plan giving the Druze minority in Syria limited autonomy within Syria's diverse population – a step many see as positive.
The activist Nabi al-Halabi says, after decades watching from outside the repressive rule of President Assad, many Druze on the Israeli side of the buffer zone are now assessing what Syria's transition could mean for them.
""After almost 60 years of Israeli occupation in the Golan Heights, and two or three generations that have been born and live and work in Israel, we're again looking east,"" he said.
""In the case of a future peace agreement between Israel and Syria, what will happen to us? People want to see how the new regime will act -- with the Druze community, the Christians, the Alawites. If we satisfied, and there are democratic elections and free speech, I believe people in the Golan Heights will be happy to be under the Syrian government again.""",Middle East

Geneva correspondent, BBC News
Tom McArthur
BBC News","Iran is using drones and intrusive digital technology to crush dissent, especially among women who refuse to obey the Islamic republic's strict dress code, the United Nations has said.
Investigators say Iranian security officials are using a strategy of ""state-sponsored vigilantism"" to encourage people to use specialist phone apps to report women for alleged dress code violations in private vehicles such as taxis and ambulances.
Their new report also highlights the increasing use of drones and security cameras to monitor hijab compliance in Tehran and in southern Iran.
For women who defy the laws, or protest against them, the consequences are severe – arrest, beating, and even rape in custody.
The findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran come after it determined last year that the country's theocracy was responsible for the ""physical violence"" that led to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in 2022.
Witnesses said the 22-year-old Kurd was badly beaten by the morality police during her arrest, but authorities denied she was mistreated and blamed ""sudden heart failure"" for her death. Her killing sparked a massive wave of protests that continues today, despite threats of violent arrest and imprisonment.
""Two-and-a-half years after the protests began in September 2022, women and girls in Iran continue to face systematic discrimination, in law and in practice, that permeates all aspects of their lives, particularly with respect to the enforcement of the mandatory hijab,"" the report said.
""The state is increasingly reliant on state-sponsored vigilantism in an apparent effort to enlist businesses and private individuals in hijab compliance, portraying it as a civic responsibility.""
At Tehran's Amirkabir University, authorities installed facial recognition software at its entrance gate to also find women not wearing the hijab, the report said.
Surveillance cameras on Iran's major roads are also being used to search for uncovered women.
Investigators also said they obtained the ""Nazer"" mobile phone app offered by Iranian police, which allows ""vetted"" members of the public and the police to report on uncovered women in vehicles, including ambulances, buses, metro cars and taxis.
""Users may add the location, date, time and the licence plate number of the vehicle in which the alleged mandatory hijab infraction occurred, which then 'flags' the vehicle online, alerting the police,"" the report said.
According to the report, a text message is then sent to the registered owner of the vehicle, warning them they had been found in violation of the mandatory hijab laws. Vehicles could be impounded for ignoring the warnings, it added.
The UN investigators interviewed almost 300 victims and witnesses – they also looked in-depth at Iran's judicial system, which they said lacks any real independence. Victims of torture and other violations were also persecuted while their families were ""systematically intimidated"", according to their report.
They also found evidence of the extrajudicial executions of three child and three adult protesters, later dismissed by the state as suicides.
The report also established additional cases of sexual violence in custody, citing the case of one arrested woman who was beaten severely, subjected to two mock executions, raped and then gang-raped.
The report will be presented to the Human Rights Council on 18 March.",Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86pvyd2qeno,High stakes as Iran nuclear issue reaches crunch moment,2025-03-14T14:55:37.060Z,"Caroline Hawley
BBC diplomatic correspondent","Almost a decade since world powers sealed a historic deal to limit the Iranian nuclear programme, this is a crunch moment for Iran and the international community.
The country is now closer than ever to being able to make a nuclear bomb.
And the agreement - designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon - expires later this year.
""It's a real fork in the road moment,"" says Dr Sanam Vakil of the London-based think tank Chatham House. ""Without meaningful and successful diplomacy we could see Iran weaponise or we could see a military strike against the Islamic Republic.""
The deal, painstakingly negotiated over nearly two years under Barack Obama's presidency, imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities in return for relief from sanctions that crippled the country's economy.
But after Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018 during his first presidency and reinstated US sanctions, Iran gradually stopped complying with its commitments.
It has accelerated its enrichment of uranium - used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs - to close to weapons-grade.
Experts say it would now take Iran less than a week to enrich enough material to make a single nuclear weapon.
Hence a flurry of urgent diplomatic activity by the US and the five other parties to the deal – the UK, China, France, Germany and Russia.
A closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council discussed Iran's nuclear programme on Wednesday.
And China hosted talks in Beijing with Iran and Russia on Friday in search of a ""diplomatic"" resolution.
""Now the situation has reached a critical juncture again,"" Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said. ""We must buy time for peace, resolve disputes through political and diplomatic means, and oppose the use of force and illegal sanctions.""
On Wednesday, a letter from President Trump was delivered in Tehran by a senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates.
The contents have not been made public.
But President Trump, after imposing new sanctions on Iran as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign, last week issued a televised ultimatum to Iran: make a deal or else.
""I've written them a letter saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing,'"" he said.
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared to reject the idea of talks with a ""bullying"" US.
So too - publicly - has President Masoud Pezeshkian, who had previously supported a resurrection of the nuclear deal, in return for an end to sanctions.
But the country has been sending out mixed messages.
""There are camps inside the country that favour negotiations,"" says Dr Vakil. ""And there are camps that see weaponisation as the best opportunity for Iran to manage its security.""
Trust in the Trump administration is in very short supply.
""They have seen his erratic, very bullying approach to [Ukraine's President Volodymyr] Zelensky. And his outlandish proposals on Gaza and they don't want to be put in that position,"" Dr Vakil adds.
Iran hates the humiliation of having a gun held to its head. But it is currently vulnerable - weakened militarily by Israeli air strikes last year, which are believed to have destroyed most of the air defences protecting its nuclear programme.
Israel has long wanted to take the facilities out.
Iranian authorities continue to insist the country's nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
But concern in the international community is becoming increasingly acute.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - tasked with monitoring the moribund nuclear deal - says it has seen Iran strengthen its nuclear capabilities at different facilities across the country over the past few years.
Its stock of uranium enriched up to 60% purity - close to the 90% required for a weapon - is ""growing very, very fast"", according to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi.
""The significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,"" the IAEA says in its latest report.
But the nuclear watchdog is no longer in a position to verify exactly what Iran is doing, because the authorities have removed IAEA surveillance equipment.
Mr Grossi says diplomatic engagement with Iran - through whatever channels possible - is now urgent and ""indispensable"".
On 18 October, the parties to the 2015 nuclear deal will lose the ability to impose so-called ""snap-back"" UN sanctions on Iran for violating its terms.
So the UK, France and Germany are wielding the threat of snap-back sanctions now, in the hope of exerting pressure while they still can.
""We are clear that we will take any diplomatic measures to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, that includes the use of snapback, if needed,"" the UK's deputy UN ambassador, James Kariuki, said on Wednesday.
The stakes are high for Iran - and the world.
""If Tehran decides to build a bomb, it could enrich enough uranium for multiple warheads within weeks,"" according to Dr Alexander Bollfrass, who focuses on preventing nuclear proliferation for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, another London-based think tank.
Designing and assembling a deliverable weapon would, however, take several months to a year or more, he told the BBC.
""Iran is closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability,"" he says. ""But it is still not clear if it has decided to develop nuclear weapons or if it is looking for negotiation leverage.""",Middle East

BBC News","Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has signed a constitutional declaration covering a five-year transitional period, three months after his Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad.
The document says Islam is the religion of the president, as the previous constitution did, and Islamic jurisprudence is ""the main source of legislation"", rather than ""a main source"", according to the drafting committee.
It also enshrines separation of powers and judicial independence, and guarantees women's rights, freedom of expression and media freedom.
""We hope it will be a new history for Syria, where we replace oppression with justice,"" Sharaa said.
UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said he welcomed the ""moves towards restoring the rule of law"" and noted that ""this development potentially fills an important legal vacuum"".
But the Kurdish-led administration in north-eastern Syria criticised the constitutional declaration, saying it ""contradicts the reality of Syria and its diversity"".
In January, rebel military commanders named Sharaa president for the transitional period, cancelled the Assad-era 2012 constitution, and dissolved the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies.
Only 10 days ago, Sharaa announced the formation of the seven-member committee to draft the constitutional declaration, which he said would serve as ""the legal framework regulating the transitional phase"".
A member of the committee, Abdul Hamid al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at a Turkish university, told a news conference on Thursday that the declaration aimed to ""create a balance between a security society and rights and freedoms"".
He said it stipulated ""absolute separation of powers"", pointing to Assad's ""encroachment"" on other branches of government during his 24-year rule.
The president would have executive authority during the transitional period, he said, but would have only one ""exceptional power"" – the ability to declare a state of emergency.
A new People's Assembly will have full responsibility for legislation. Two thirds of its members will be appointed by a committee selected by the president and one third chosen by the president himself.
A committee will also be formed to draft a new permanent constitution.
Sharaa has promised an inclusive government that will run the country until the new constitution is finalised and free and fair elections are held.
However, he faces significant challenges following a devastating civil war that erupted when Assad ordered a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests 14 years ago.
Last week, gunmen supporting Sharaa's Sunni Islamist-led government were accused of carrying out revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect in the western coastal region following a deadly ambush on a security patrol by gunmen loyal to the former regime. One monitoring group has said almost 1,500 civilians were killed.
Sharaa has pledged to hold the perpetrators to account and ordered the formation of a committee aimed at preserving civil peace.
However, many Alawites and members of other religious and ethnic minorities are wary of his intentions because of his past as the leader of al-Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate.
UN Secretary General António Guterres said on Thursday that nothing could justify the killing of civilians and warned that Syria's ""much-deserved brighter future hangs in the balance"".
""The caretaker authorities have repeatedly committed to building a new Syria based on inclusive and credible foundations for all Syrians. Now is the time for action,"" he added.",Middle East

BBC News","UN experts have accused Israel of increasingly using sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians and carrying out ""genocidal acts"" through the systematic destruction of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities.
A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents alleged violations, including rape, in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.
It also says the destruction of maternity wards in Gaza and embryos at a fertility clinic could indicate a strategy to prevent births among a particular group - one of the legal definitions of genocide.
Israel said it ""categorically rejects the unfounded allegations"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded angrily, calling the Human Rights Council ""an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body"".
Instead of focusing on war crimes committed by Hamas, he said, it was attacking Israel with ""false accusations"".
Warning: This article contains distressing content
The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.
The three-member commission said its new report was based on testimony from victims and witnesses of sexual and reproductive violence, some of whom spoke during two days of public hearings held in Geneva earlier this week, as well as verified photos and video footage, and information from civil society and women's rights organisations.
The commission's chair Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief, said the evidence collected ""reveals a deplorable increase in sexual and gender-based violence"" that she claimed was being employed by Israel against Palestinians ""to terrorise them and perpetuate a system of oppression that undermines their right to self-determination"".
The report says specific forms of sexual and gender-based violence - such as forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault - ""comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians"".
Other forms of such violence, including rape and violence to the genitals, were ""committed either under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership"", it alleges.
The report does not provide examples of explicit orders from commanders or senior officials. But it does cite statements from Israeli ministers who defended soldiers who were accused of severely mistreating a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman military base last year.
Commission member Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, told the BBC: ""Sexual violence is now so widespread that it can only be considered systematic. It's got beyond the level of random acts by rogue individuals.""
Israel has rejected accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of Gaza detainees, and insisted it is fully committed to international legal standards.
The report says the commission also found that Israeli forces had systematically destroyed sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities across Gaza during the 17-month war there.
It concludes that women and girls have died from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth due to conditions imposed by the Israeli authorities which have denied access to reproductive health care, and says they amount to the crime against humanity of extermination.
The commission also alleges that Israeli authorities have ""destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group"" through the ""systematic destruction"" of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity hospitals and maternity wards of hospitals and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, Al-Basma IVF Centre in Gaza City.
This amounts to ""two categories of genocidal acts in the Rome Statute and the Genocide Convention, including deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians and imposing measures intended to prevent births"", it concludes.
According to the report, the embryology laboratory at Al-Basma was hit in early December 2023, reportedly destroying around 4,000 embryos as well as 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.
It says the commission determined through visual analysis of pictures that the damage was caused by a large calibre projectile, most probably an Israeli tank shell, and that it was intentionally attacked by Israeli forces. However, the Israeli military told ABC News at the time that it was not aware of a strike on the clinic. The BBC has contacted the IDF for comment.
""The deliberate destruction of a health facility is one serious issue for international humanitarian law and human rights law. But it does appear from our analysis of the attack on this clinic, that it was knowingly and intentionally directed towards the destruction of reproductive services,"" Mr Sidoti said. ""The consequence of this is the prevention of births.""
In a statement, Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva said the report was ""a shameless attempt to incriminate the [Israel Defense Forces] and manufacture the illusion of 'systemic' use of [sexual and gender-based violence]"".
It criticised what it called the commission's decision to use ""information from second-hand single uncorroborated sources"", which it said was inconsistent with established UN standards and methodologies.
The statement also stressed that the IDF had ""concrete directives, procedures, orders, and policies, which unequivocally prohibit such misconduct"", as well as mechanisms to investigate any incidents of alleged sexual violence.
Israel's prime minister also rejected the report's findings and called the Human Rights Council an ""anti-Israel circus"".
""Instead of focusing on the crimes against humanity and the war crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the worst massacre carried out against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, the UN has again chosen to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including baseless accusations of sexual violence,"" Netanyahu said.
The UN experts determined there were ""reasonable grounds to conclude"" the allegations were committed, and that ""such systematic attacks were intentional"", Fernando Travesi of the International Center for Transitional Justice told the BBC.
He said they reached that conclusion by analysing digital content and hearing victim and witness statements, and he sees no reason to question whether they had sufficient evidence.
But the commission of inquiry applies a different threshold of evidence to a court of law, and to establish criminal liability for genocide the conclusions would need to be confirmed in court ""beyond any reasonable doubt"", Mr Travesi said.
The International Court of Justice is hearing a case bought by South Africa that accuses Israeli forces of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently denied the allegation.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 48,520 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has also been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",Middle East

Middle East correspondent
Reporting fromJerusalem","The White House's envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in Qatar to join indirect talks between Israel and Hamas on extending the fragile ceasefire in Gaza.
This week, negotiators from both sides have begun meeting mediators for the first time since President Donald Trump took office on 20 January. The 42-day first phase of the Gaza deal and temporary truce came into effect on the eve of his inauguration.
That first phase ultimately saw Hamas return 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others - in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel – as well as five living Thai hostages. It ended on 1 March.
Israel now hopes the US can advance a plan for a two-month truce extension, which would start with the release of about half of the living hostages still held.
Hamas has so far rejected that, demanding immediate talks on the second phase in the original ceasefire agreement, which would end the war and lead to a full Israeli troop withdrawal.
However, it stated that it was approaching the ongoing discussions in Doha with ""full responsibility and positivity"".
Since the start of this month, Israel has blocked all aid deliveries - including food and fuel - to Gaza, saying it aims to put pressure on Hamas.
Electricity has also been cut to the only desalination plant in the territory providing clean water, so that it is now running at a reduced capacity on generators using fuel reserves.
In response, the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Tuesday that it would restart attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, threatening to throw a key maritime route into chaos once again.
There is growing alarm at the potential impact of Israel blocking goods to Gaza, with some of its allies warning that this could violate international law.
The local UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator, Muhannad Hadi, has stated: ""Any further delays [on aid entering] will further reverse any progress we have managed to achieve during the ceasefire.""
""We pray that these matters get resolved urgently,"" a baker, Husam Rustom, told the BBC.
With the halt to supplies of flour and cooking gas, he said his bakery - which had been providing over 2,000 packs of bread a day - had been forced to close as well as several others in the southern city of Khan Younis.
""We are exhausted and tired of all this. It's driving us mad,"" said Zeinab al-Bayuk, a grandmother. She added that food prices had been rising rapidly.
Mariam Abu Mukhimer, a student, opposed an extension of the existing truce. ""There needs to be a solution that ends the war,"" she said. ""It's enough!""
The US has never confirmed it, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 2 March that Witkoff had proposed a temporary extension of the ceasefire until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover.
According to this plan, which Netanyahu said Israel had accepted, half of the hostages would be released together at the outset, and the other half at the end.
The PM suggested Witkoff had ""even defined his proposal as a corridor for negotiations on the second stage. Israel is ready for this.""
It is believed that Hamas is still holding up to 24 living hostages in Gaza and the remains of 35 others. An American-Israeli soldier, 21-year-old Edan Alexander, is among those said to be alive. There are also the bodies of four other American citizens.
Hamas has accused Israel of reneging on the original ceasefire deal.
Despite pressure from regional mediators - Qatar and Egypt - as well as the US, it is thought unlikely that the armed group will give up many of the hostages without a full end to fighting in Gaza. It sees them as its major bargaining chips in talks.
For the relatives and supporters of Israelis held captive, these are desperate times.
Since Saturday, some have been camping outside the defence ministry in Tel Aviv to demand an immediate Gaza ceasefire deal that would free everyone in captivity.
""How can I start processing our personal tragedy when the national trauma is not yet over?"" said Ofri Bibas, the sister of Yarden Bibas, at the protest on Monday evening.
The recent exchanges with Hamas led to the release of her brother and the return of the bodies of her sister-in-law, Shiri, and two young nephews, Ariel and Kfir, who were killed in Gaza.
""I have 59 brothers and sisters who are in hell,"" Ofri continued - referring to the total remaining number of hostages. ""We received Yarden alive, but Shiri and the children could have been saved. By Passover, everyone must be home, and the only way to bring everyone back is to end the war. Now.""
A poll for Israel's Channel 13 TV indicates that half of Israelis believe that the US president is more concerned about the fate of the hostages than Netanyahu.
Asked which of the two they thought was more concerned, 50% of respondents said Trump, 29% Netanyahu, and the rest were not sure.
Far-right allies of the prime minister have threatened to collapse his governing coalition if fighting does not resume in Gaza to achieve its war goal of crushing Hamas.
Up to now, both Israel and Hamas have largely refrained from returning to all-out hostilities in the Palestinian territory.
However, recently, Israel has carried out daily strikes. On Tuesday, four men were killed in Wadi Gaza, which is also known as the Netzarim Corridor – an area from which Israeli forces withdrew as part of the Gaza ceasefire terms.
The Israeli military said its air force had targeted ""several terrorists engaged in suspicious activity posing a threat to [Israeli] troops"".
Speaking to the BBC in Gaza City, the father of one of those killed, Arafat Hana, said his son, Omar, had done nothing wrong.
He said he was with neighbours walking to a displaced people's camp where they had previously stayed to retrieve belongings.
""They were innocent. They were just going to get mattresses and other things. They weren't carrying rockets!"" said Umm Tareq Obaid, who lived near the men.
The new threats from the Houthis have the potential to end a period of relative calm in the wider region which began with the Gaza ceasefire on 19 January.
Over 15 months from November 2023, they used missiles and drones to attack more than 100 merchant ships, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Many vessels had no connection to Israel. Two sank, one was seized, and four sailors were killed.
The Houthis say they now want ""to pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies"".
However, there has been no immediate sign of ships being targeted.
The attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, with 251 taken hostage. Most women and children held captive were released during a week-long truce in November 2023.
The unprecedented, deadly assault triggered a war in Gaza that has since killed more than 48,500 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry which are used by the UN and others.",Middle East

Reporting fromDamascus","Entire families, including women and children, were killed during the recent violence in Syria's coastal region, the UN human rights office says.
A spokesman told reporters that the UN had so far verified the killing of 111 civilians since last Thursday, but that the actual figure was believed to be significantly higher.
Many of the cases were summary executions and appeared to have been carried out on a sectarian basis, with predominantly Alawite areas targeted in particular, he added.
Gunmen supporting the Sunni Islamist-led government have been accused of carrying out revenge killings following a deadly ambush on a security patrol by loyalists of president Bashar al-Assad, who is an Alawite.
A monitoring group has reported that more than 1,200 civilians, most of them Alawites, have been killed in Latakia, Tatous, Hama and Homs provinces.
The UN has welcomed the promise by Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa to form an independent investigative committee and to hold those responsible to account.
The violence was the worst in Syria since Sharaa led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December, ending 13 years of civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed.
Syria's north-west Mediterranean coast is the heartland of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which many of the former Assad regime's political and military elite belonged.
Last week, security forces launched an operation in the region in response to a growing insurgency by Assad loyalists.
The violence escalated on Thursday, after 13 security personnel were killed in an ambush by gunmen in the coastal town of Jableh.
Security forces responded by sending reinforcements to the region, who were joined by armed groups and individuals supporting the government.
They stormed many Alawite towns and villages across the region, where residents said they carried out revenge killings and looted homes and shops.
A spokesperson for the UN human rights office, Thameen Al-Kheetan, said on Tuesday that reports were continuing to emerge of the ""distressing scale of the violence"".
He said the UN, using strict verification methods, had so far documented the killings of 90 male civilians, 18 women, two girls and one boy.
Initial reports indicated that the perpetrators were ""unidentified armed individuals, members of armed groups allegedly supporting the caretaker authorities' security forces, and by elements associated with the former government"", he added.
""In a number of extremely disturbing instances, entire families - including women, children and individuals hors de combat - were killed, with predominantly Alawite cities and villages targeted in particular,"" he said, referring to combatants who have been captured, expressed an intention to surrender, or are incapacitated.
""According to many testimonies collected by our office, perpetrators raided houses, asking residents whether they were Alawite or Sunni before proceeding to either kill or spare them accordingly. Some survivors told us that many men were shot dead in front of their families.""
Assad loyalists also raided several hospitals in Latakia, Tartous and Baniyas, according to Mr Kheetan. They clashed with security forces, reportedly resulting in dozens of civilian casualties, including patients and medics, was well as damage to the hospitals.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said its civilian death toll had risen to 1,225, after another 132 people were reported killed on Tuesday, including 62 in the town of Baniyas. About 230 security personnel and 250 pro-Assad fighters have also been killed, according to its network of sources.
Mr Kheetan said the UN human rights chief urged Syrian authorities to carry out prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigations.
""All those found responsible for violations must be held to account, regardless of their affiliation, in line with international law norms and standards. Victims and their families have the right to truth, justice and reparations,"" he stressed.
A spokesman for the new investigative committee set up by the government said it was already ""gathering and reviewing evidence"" and would present a report in 30 days.
""No-one is above the law. The committee will relay all the results to the entity that launched it, the presidency, and the judiciary,"" Yasser Farhan told a news conference.
The state-run Sana news agency also reported that four people had been arrested over ""bloody violations against civilians"" in a coastal village after they were identified in videos.
Meanwhile, residents of the region said the situation appeared calm on Tuesday, with only sporadic gunfire heard overnight.
A man who fled the town of Baniyas three days ago told the BBC that he had managed to get back to his home to check on it because security forces had set up checkpoints in the neighbourhood to prevent further killings and looting.
The man, who asked to remain anonymous, also said the bodies which had been lying on the streets of Baniyas last week were no longer there.
The Syrian Red Crescent, with the help of security forces, was said to be recovering bodies and burying them in mass graves in the town's cemetery.
However, most families have not returned home, because they are traumatised by what happened and worried about their safety, amid reports of continued killings and looting.
Many sought refuge at the Russian-controlled Hmeimim airbase outside the city of Latakia, sheltered in local schools or fled to rural areas.
Others crossed into neighbouring Lebanon, where a woman told the BBC that armed men had attacked her house in rural Hama two months ago and killed men from her family.
""My nephews were 11 and 12 years old. They rounded them up and lined up all the other young Alawite men,"" Hind said.
""One of them asked his friend about our religion. He said, 'They are Alawites,' so he pointed his gun and killed all the men in front of him.""
""They see us as guilty just because our president was Alawite. But the truth is we are the poorest. Our young men joined the military only to be taken to fight and to be killed.""
A young man named Wissam said he no longer trusted the government and security forces.
""They're all the same - armed and with covered faces. They have privileges that no-one else has. They do whatever they want,"" he claimed.",Middle East

Reporting fromDamascus","A Kurdish-led militia alliance which controls north-eastern Syria has signed a deal to integrate all military and civilian institutions into the Syrian state, the country's presidency says.
The agreement, which includes a complete cessation of hostilities, says the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will hand over control of the region's border posts, airport, and vital oil and gas fields.
It also recognises the Kurdish minority as ""an integral part of the Syrian state"" and guarantees ""the rights of all Syrians to representation and participation in the political process"".
SDF commander Mazloum Abdi called the deal a ""real opportunity to build a new Syria"".
""We are committed to building a better future that guarantees the rights of all Syrians and fulfils their aspirations for peace and dignity,"" he wrote on X after signing the deal in Damascus on Monday alongside interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.
The deal represents a major step towards Sharaa's goal to unify the fractured country after his Sunni Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew president Bashar al-Assad in December and ended 13 years of devastating civil war.
It could also de-escalate the SDF's conflict with neighbouring Turkey and Turkish-backed Syrian former rebel factions allied to the government, which are trying to push the alliance out of areas near the border.
There were celebrations welcoming the announcement of the deal on the streets of several cities on Monday night, with many people expressing relief at a time when Syria is facing several other threats to its stability.
The recent mass killings of Alawite civilians in the western coastal region during clashes between security forces and Assad loyalists have sparked calls for international protection for Syria's religious and ethnic minorities and amplified voices promoting division.
There is also concern about the south, where some Druze militias in Suweida province have been reluctant to lay down their arms. However, Suweida residents said representatives met Sharaa in Damascus on Monday and a deal like the SDF's was expected soon.
Israel has also threatened to intervene to protect the Druze from the government, which it considers a threat. It has also carried out an air campaign to destroy much of Syria's military capabilities and seized a demilitarised buffer zone next to the occupied Golan Heights.
The SDF, which has tens of thousands of well-armed and well-trained fighters, was not aligned with either Assad's regime or the opposition during the civil war.
It currently controls more than 46,000 sq km (18,000 sq miles) of territory in the north-east, where it defeated the Islamic State (IS) group in 2019 with the help of a US-led coalition.
The SDF plays a major role in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), which governs the region also known to Kurds as Rojava.
About 10,000 IS fighters are being detained in SDF-run prisons spread across the region and about 45,000 other people linked to IS, mostly women and children, are held in several camps.
Since the fall of Assad, the SDF has warned that attacks from Turkish-backed factions are forcing it to divert fighters away from guarding the prisons and paving the way for an IS resurgence.
The Turkish government views the biggest militia in the SDF, the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), as a terrorist organisation. It says it the YPG is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) group that waged an insurgency in Turkey for decades but whose imprisoned leader recently declared a ceasefire.
There was no immediate comment from Turkey in response to Monday's agreement. However, Turkish officials have previously called for all Kurdish-led groups in north-eastern Syria to dissolve and integrate with the new government.
Several Arab countries welcomed the deal, with Saudi Arabia and Qatar both describing it as an important step towards maintaining ""civil peace"".
Between 25 and 35 million Kurds inhabit a mountainous region straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. They make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state.

A Home Office spokesperson said he had been remanded in custody.
Abu Wadee will appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

BBC News, London and Geneva","The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, has accused Israel of weaponising humanitarian aid with its blockade of goods and electricity into Gaza.
Speaking in Geneva, Philippe Lazzarini warned of a renewed hunger crisis if aid supplies did not resume.
Israel stopped the entry of all aid at the beginning of the month, accusing Hamas of rejecting a US proposal to extend the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire.
It also cut off electricity over the weekend - a move the UK and Germany have condemned - with Energy Minister Eli Cohen saying the move aimed to ""bring back all the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after [the war].""
When the truce began, aid supplies increased tenfold, easing food shortages and restoring some health services.
Now those supplies have been blocked and electricity to a major water desalination plant has been cut.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres's spokesman said this would substantially reduce the availability of drinking water in Gaza.
""The Secretary-General is very concerned about Israel's decision to limit the electricity supply going into Gaza. This latest decision will substantially reduce the availability of drinking water in the Gaza Strip,"" said Stephane Dujarric.
""Starting today, the facility is set to run on backup generators, which will reduce water production capacity. Restoring this connection is vital for tens of thousands of families and children.""
The Israeli government has further said it has not ruled out cutting off water supplies.
Mr Lazzarini also criticised Israel's move to cut off aid and electricity, saying an increasing impact on the population could be expected.
""Obviously, the risk is that we go back to a situation we experienced months ago about deepening hunger in the Gaza Strip,"" he said.
""Whatever the intent is, it's clearly a weaponisation of humanitarian aid into Gaza. We have seen the situation is deteriorating very, very quickly.""
Israel has banned Unrwa amid claims some of its staff support Hamas and says other aid agencies should step in. But they too are being blocked from Gaza.
Mr Lazzarini said the only viable alternative to the agency was ""capable Palestinian institutions... in a Palestinian state"".
Unrwa was continuing to operate in Gaza and the West Bank, he said, adding that the Israeli ban had left it facing ""serious operational challenges"".
Israeli negotiators were due in Qatar for talks on extending the ceasefire in Gaza.
Israel wants Hamas to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire.
But Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase, which would see the release of the remaining hostages from Gaza, withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent end to war.
Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages as well as the bodies of 35 others.
Hamas's attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and saw 251 people taken hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.
Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were fighters.",Middle East

BBC News","Syria's defence ministry says it has completed a military operation in the country's western coastal region, after days of violence in which hundreds of people have been killed.
Security forces had ""neutralized"" loyalists of former president Bashar al-Assad in several towns in Latakia and Tartous provinces and were ""paving the way for life to return to normal"", a ministry spokesman said.
A monitoring group says more than 1,500 people have been killed since Thursday, including 1,068 civilians.
Gunmen loyal to the Sunni Islamist-led government have been accused of carrying out revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect following a deadly ambush on a security patrol.
The interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has said he will set up an independent committee to investigate the killings and insisted the perpetrators would be held accountable.
The violence is the worst in Syria since Sharaa led the lightning rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December, ending 13 years of devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others were forced to flee their homes.
Defence ministry spokesman Hassan Abdul Ghani announced on X that the security operation in Latakia and Tartous had ended after ""achieving all the specified objectives"".
""Our forces have neutralised the security cells and remnants of the former regime from the town of al-Mukhtareyah, the town of al-Mazairaa, the area of al-Zobar, and other locations in Latakia province, as well as Dalia town, Tanita town, and Qadmous in Tartous province, resulting in the thwarting of threats and securing the area,"" he said.
He also said that public institutions in the region were now able to resume their work, adding: ""We are preparing for the return of normal life and working to reinforce security and stability.""
Abdul Ghani promised that security forces would also ""give the investigating committee the full opportunity to uncover the circumstances of these incidents, verify the facts and deliver justice to the oppressed"".
In an interview on Monday, Sharaa acknowledged that there were ""many violations"" following the outbreak of violence and promised to punish everyone responsible, including his own allies if necessary.
""Syria is a state of law. The law will take its course on all,"" he told Reuters news agency.
""We fought to defend the oppressed, and we won't accept that any blood be shed unjustly, or goes without punishment or accountability, even among those closest to us,"" he said.
The government launched the operation in Latakia province in response to a growing insurgency by Assad loyalists in recent weeks. The region is the heartland of the Alawite sect, to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged.
On Thursday, security personnel were ambushed by gunmen in the town of Jableh as they tried to arrest a wanted Assad regime official. At least 13 officers were reportedly killed.
Security forces responded by sending reinforcements to the region, who were joined by armed supporters of the government. Over the next four days, they stormed many Alawite towns and villages, where residents said they carried out revenge killings and lootings.
A widely shared video showed the bodies of at least two dozen men in civilian clothing, piled in the yard of a house, in al-Mukhtareyah. Elsewhere, accounts emerged of fighters searching for Alawite members and killing entire families on the spot.
Hiba, an Alawite woman in Baniyas, told the BBC that Chechen fighters loyal to the government had attacked her neighbourhood.
""Our neighbours were killed including children. They came and took everything, gold, everything… They stole all of the cars in the neighbourhood. They even went to the supermarket and they took everything from the shelves.""
""We were waiting for our turn. We didn't know when it would come. We saw death, we saw people dying in front of us and now all of our friends, our neighbours, are gone,"" she added. ""They killed innocent people in cold blood who had nothing to do with any of this.""
An Alawite man whose family lives in Baniyas said in a voice message that a relative was kidnapped from his home by gunmen from Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who went door to door searching for Alawites.
""His mother made a mistake opening the door when she did. An HTS member fired between her legs... so she screamed,"" he said. ""Her son... ran to see what happened with her. When they [saw] him, they took him with them and disappeared. And they didn't return.""
He also said residents of Alawite neighbourhoods of Baniyas were still hiding in their houses on Monday morning because they were too afraid to venture outside to see if it was safe.
The bodies of those killed had been buried in a mass grave near a shrine on the outskirts of the town, while those who were kidnapped had not yet returned, he added.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that more than 1,540 people have been killed in Latakia, Tartous, Hama and Homs provinces.
They included 1,068 civilians, the vast majority of them Alawites who it said had died as a result of ""killings, field executions and ethnic cleansing operations"" by security personnel or pro-government fighters, as well as 230 security personnel and 250 pro-Assad fighters.
Security sources also told Reuters that 300 security personnel had been killed.
The BBC has been unable to independently verify the death tolls.
State news agency Sana said a mass grave containing the bodies of security personnel had been found in the former president's hometown of Qardaha on Sunday. Turkey-based Syria TV cited residents as saying Assad loyalists had buried police killed in the recent fighting there.
UN human rights chief Volker Türk said his office had received ""extremely disturbing reports of entire families, including women, children and hors de combat fighters, being killed"".

A UK-based monitor said 830 civilians were killed in ""massacres"" targeting Alawites on the west coast on Friday and Saturday.
The BBC has been unable to independently verify the death toll of the violence, which is believed to be the worst since the fall of the Assad regime.
In a speech broadcast on national TV and posted on social media, Sharaa, whose rebel movement toppled Bashar al-Assad in December, also promised to hunt down Assad loyalists.
The fighting has also killed 231 members of the security forces and 250 pro-Assad fighters, according to the monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), taking the overall death toll to 1,311.
""Today, as we stand at this critical moment, we find ourselves facing a new danger - attempts by remnants of the former regime and their foreign backers to incite new strife and drag our country into a civil war, aiming to divide it and destroy its unity and stability,"" the interim president said on Sunday.

""No-one will be above the law and anyone whose hands are stained with the blood of Syrians will face justice sooner rather than later.""
Earlier on Sunday, he announced on Telegram that an ""independent committee"" had been formed to ""investigate the violations against civilians and identify those responsible for them"".
He also appealed for national unity but did not comment directly on accusations that atrocities were being committed by his supporters in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous.
""God willing, we will be able to live together in this country,"" he said in an separate address from a Damascus mosque.
A Syrian security source said the pace of fighting had slowed around the cities of Latakia, Jabla and Baniyas on Sunday, according to Reuters.
The violence of recent days has been sparked after ambushes on government forces on Thursday.
A Syrian defence ministry spokesman described it to the Sana state news agency as ""treacherous attacks"" against security personnel.
It has since escalated into a wave of clashes between Assad loyalists and government forces.
Hundreds of Syrians gathered in Damascus to protest against the deadly violence in the country. Demonstrators congregated in Marjeh Square - also known as Martyrs' Square - with placards on Sunday.
Amid the fighting, hundreds of civilians living along the Mediterranean coast have fled their homes. The provinces of Latakia and Tartous were former heartlands of deposed president Bashar al-Assad, who also belongs to the Alawite minority.
Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni Muslim.
The violence has left the Alawite community in ""a state of horror"", an activist in Latakia told the BBC on Friday.
Large crowds sought refuge at a Russian military base at Hmeimim in Latakia, according to the Reuters news agency.
Video footage shared by Reuters showed dozens of people chanting ""people want Russian protection"" outside the base.
Meanwhile, local media reported dozens of families had also fled to neighbouring Lebanon.
The UN's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said he was ""deeply alarmed"" by ""very troubling reports of civilian casualties"" in Syria's coastal areas.
He called on all sides to refrain from actions which could ""destabilise"" the country and jeopardise a ""credible and inclusive political transition"".
Similarly, the UN human rights chief Volker Türk called the reports ""extremely disturbing"", adding the need for ""prompt, transparent and impartial investigations"" into all the violations.
Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, described the killings of Alawites in Latakia and Tartous as ""systematic"" and ""extremely dangerous"", and accused Syria's interim government of failing to control the crisis.
""It was expected that after the fall of the Assad government, Syria would face a difficult transition,"" Amani said. ""But the scale of violence now unfolding is unprecedented and deeply troubling.""

Energy minister Eli Cohen's announcement came a week after Israel cut off all aid supplies to the territory, which has a population of more than two million people.
In a video statement on Sunday, Cohen said: ""We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after [the war].""
The decision to cut electricity is expected to primarily affect the operation of desalination plants, which are crucial for providing clean drinking water.
The government said it has not ruled out cutting off water supplies.
In his statement, Cohen said: ""I have just signed the order to stop supplying electricity immediately to the Gaza Strip.""
Israel cut off most of the mains electricity supply to Gaza earlier in the war.
Talks to prolong the fragile ceasefire, the first phase of which ended on 1 March, are expected to resume in Qatar on Monday.
Israel wants Hamas to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire.
But Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase, which would see the release of the remaining hostages from Gaza, withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent end to war.
Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages as well as the bodies of 35 others.
The militant group - which has warned that cutting off supplies to Gaza would affect the hostages as well - said on Sunday that it had wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position and called for an immediate start of the ceasefire's second phase.
Gaza's coastal territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated by the war, and generators and solar panels are used for some of the power supply.
Israel has faced criticism over cutting off supplies to Gaza.
""Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,"" the United Nations human rights office said on Friday.
Hamas has reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections.
That committee would work under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is based in the occupied West Bank.
Israel has rejected the PA having any role in Gaza but has not put forward an alternative for post-war rule.
Hamas's attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and saw 251 people taken hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.

Reporting fromDamascus, Syria","Syria's interim leader has appealed for unity, as violence and revenge killings continued in areas loyal to ousted former leader Bashar al-Assad on Sunday.
Hundreds of people have reportedly fled their homes in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus - strongholds of Assad support.
Local residents have described scenes of looting and mass killings, including of children.
In Hai Al Kusour, a predominantly Alawite neighbourhood in the coastal city of Banias, residents say the streets are filled with scattered bodies, piled up and covered in blood. Men of different ages were shot dead there, witnesses said.
The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam and makes up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni Muslim. Assad belongs to the sect.
People were too scared to even look out of their windows on Friday. The internet connection is unstable, but when connected they learned of their neighbours' deaths from Facebook posts.
One man, Ayman Fares, told the BBC he was saved by his recent imprisonment. He had posted a video on his Facebook account in August 2023 criticising Assad for his corrupt rule. He was arrested soon after, and only released when Islamist-led forces freed prisoners after Assad's fall last December.
The fighters who raided the streets of Hai Al Kusour recognised him, so he was spared death but not the looting. They took his cars and continued to raid other houses.
""They were strangers, I can't identify their identity or language, but they seemed to be Uzbek or Chechen,"" Mr Fares told me by phone.
""There were also some Syrians with them but not from the official security. Some civilians also were among those who carried out the killing,"" he added.
Mr Fares said he saw families killed in their own homes, and women and children covered in blood. Some families ran to their rooftops to hide but were not spared the bloodshed. ""It is horrific,"" he said.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented more than 740 civilians killed in the coastal cities of Latakia, Jableh and Banias. A further 300 members of the security forces and remnants of the Assad regime are reported to have died in clashes.
The BBC has not been able to independently verify the death toll.
Mr Fares said things stabilised when the Syrian army and security forces arrived in the city of Banias. They pushed other factions out of the city and provided corridors for families to access safe areas, he said.
Ali, another resident of Banias who asked us not to use his full name, corroborated Mr Fares' account. Ali, who lived in Kusour with his wife and 14-year-old daughter, fled his home with the assistance of security forces.
""They came to our building. We were too scared just listening to the fire and screams of people in the neighbourhood. We learned about the deaths from sporadic Facebook posts when we managed to connect. But when they came to our building, we thought we are done,"" he said.
""They were after money. They knocked on our neighbour's door taking his car, his money and all the gold or valuables he had in his home. But he was not killed.""
Ali and his family were picked up by his Sunni neighbours, who follow a different branch of Islam, and are now staying with them. ""We lived together for years, Alawites, Sunnis and Christians. We never experienced this,"" he told me.
""The Sunnis rushed to protect Alawites from the killing that happened and now the official forces are in town to restore order.""
Ali said families were taken to a school in a neighbourhood that is predominantly Sunni, where they will be protected until members of the factions that carried out the killings are ousted from Banias.
The violence started on Thursday after Assad loyalists - who refused to give up arms - ambushed security forces around the coastal cities of Latakia and Jableh, killing dozens of them.
Ghiath Dallah, an ex-brigadier general in Assad's army, has announced a new rebellion against the current government, saying he was establishing the ""Military Council for the Liberation of Syria"".
Some reports suggest that former security officers of the Assad regime who refused to give up arms are forming a resistance group in the mountains.
Mr Fares said most of the Alawite community reject them and blame Dallah and other hardline Assad loyalists for the violence.
""They benefit from the bloodshed that's happening. What we need now is official security to prevail and to prosecute the killers from the factions who did the mass killing so the country restores safety,"" he said.
But others also blame interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa, saying he dismantled Syria's security, army and police establishments with no clear strategy for dealing with thousands of officers and personnel left unemployed.
Some of these individuals, especially among the police, had nothing to do with the killing during Assad's regime. The new authorities also dismissed thousands of public employees from their work.
With 90% of Syria's population living below the poverty line and thousands left without an income, it's fertile ground for a rebellion.
There is a split in views in Syria over what is happening. The wider community condemns the killing of any civilians and demonstrations have been organised in Damascus to mourn the deaths and condemn the violence.
But over the past two days, there were also calls for ""Jihad"" in different parts of Syria. Residents in Banias said that along with the factions, there were some civilians who were armed and joined forces in the killing.
Syria's majority Sunnis have faced atrocities at the hands of the Assad regime's forces over the past 13 years. This fuelled sectarian hatred mainly towards the Alawite minority, where members of the community are affiliated with war crimes.
According to human rights groups, there is evidence that Alawite security officers were involved in the killing and torture of thousands of Syrians, the majority of which are Sunni Muslims, during the Assad regime.
Those members of the army and security forces who were killed are mostly from the Sunni community and now some in the Sunni community are calling for retaliation, but the president has called for calm.
Sharaa, whose Islamist forces toppled Assad three months ago, must now balance providing safety for all with pursuing justice for the crimes of the Assad regime and its henchmen.
While he has authority over some of the troops who helped him to power, some factions are clearly out of his control. Those factions also include foreign fighters with a radical Islamist agenda.
To lead Syria into a safe and democratic future, many argue Sharaa needs to end the presence of any foreign fighters and deliver a constitution that protects the rights of all Syrians, regardless of their background or religion.
While he is seen to be working towards the legal framework for such a constitution, controlling the violent factions and expelling foreign fighters will prove a major challenge.",Middle East

BBC News","Leading European nations have said they support an Arab-backed plan for the reconstruction of Gaza that would cost $53 billion (£41 billion) and avoid displacing Palestinians from the territory.
The plan, drawn up by Egypt and endorsed by Arab leaders, has been rejected by Israel and by US President Donald Trump, who presented his own vision to turn the Gaza Strip into a ""Middle East Riviera"".
On Saturday the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Britain welcomed the plan, which calls for Gaza to be rebuilt over five years, as ""realistic"".
In a statement, they said the proposal promised ""swift and sustainable improvement of the catastrophic living conditions"" for the people of Gaza.
The plan calls for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed to the territory.
The committee would be responsible for overseeing humanitarian aid and temporarily managing Gaza's affairs under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority.
The proposal was drawn up amid growing concern that Gaza's fragile ceasefire deal could collapse after the six-week first phase expired on 1 March.
Israel has blocked aid from entering the territory to pressure Hamas to accept a new US proposal for a temporary extension of the truce, during which more hostages held in Gaza would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
But Hamas has insisted that the second phase of the ceasefire, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops, should begin as agreed.
Israel will send a negotiating team to Qatar on Monday to take part in talks on extending the ceasefire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.
It remains unclear if or when the second phase of the ceasefire agreement will be implemented. But a Hamas spokesman, Abdel Latif al-Qanoua, spoke of ""positive indicators"" for next week's talks.
The Arab-backed plan for Gaza's future is an alternative to Trump's idea for the US to take over the territory and resettle its population.
Egypt presented the plan at an emergency Arab League summit on Tuesday and it was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.
But both the White House and Israeli foreign ministry said it failed to address realities in Gaza.
""Residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,"" Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump's National Security Council, said late on Tuesday.
""President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,"" the statement added.
The statement issued by the four European countries on Saturday said they were ""committed to working with the Arab initiative"" and they appreciated the ""important signal"" the Arab states had sent by developing it.
The statement said Hamas ""must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel any more"" and that the four countries ""support the central role for the Palestinian Authority and the implementation of its reform agenda"".
Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes since the start of hostilities. Israel began military operations after Hamas's October 2023 attack which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage.
Gaza has suffered vast destruction with a huge humanitarian impact. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and much infrastructure across the strip has been levelled by air strikes.

BBC News","Syrian security forces are alleged to have executed dozens of people belonging to the Alawite minority in the coastal province of Latakia, according to a war monitoring group.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said 162 civilians have been killed in ""field executions"" in the region - a heartland of deposed president Bashar al-Assad, who also belongs to the Alawite sect.
An interior ministry source told the country's official news agency Sana that ""individual violations"" had occurred on the coast and pledged to put a stop to them.
BBC News has not been able to verify claims that the killings were committed by the forces of Syria's new rulers.
The total killed includes 13 women and five children, the SOHR told the AFP news agency.
Syria's new rulers, who ousted Assad in December, said a military operation is now being launched in the former president's home town of Qardaha.
In his first statement since the violence broke out, the country's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said Syria would pursue the ""remnants"" of the ousted Assad regime and bring them to trial, Reuters reports.
This follows clashes between government forces and fighters loyal to Assad, which left more than 70 dead.
A curfew has been imposed in the cities of Homs, Latakia and Tartous, where the fighting has broken out, and the governor of Latakia has said all power to the province has been cut.
Earlier, BBC Verify confirmed two videos that showed a body being dragged behind a car in Latakia.
The violence has left the Alawite community in ""a state of horror"", a Syrian activist in the city told BBC Newshour.
""They are feeling so fearful. They are in a state of shock,"" said the activist, who did not want to use his name for fear of reprisals.
""They don't know what to do. There is no government or state who is ready to help them, to protect them, "" he added.
The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said in a statement he was ""deeply concerned"" by reports of the clashes and killings.
He called on all parties to ""refrain from actions that could further inflame tensions, escalate conflict, exacerbate the suffering of affected communities, destabilize Syria, and jeopardize a credible and inclusive political transition.""
The region is the heartland of the Alawite minority and a stronghold of the Assad family, which belongs to the sect.
Estimations of the number of people killed in the violence vary, and the BBC has been unable to independently verify them.
Residents say they have been targets of sectarian violence, with one Alawite woman telling BBC Arabic that many Syrians are ""scared"" regardless of if they were on the coast or in the capital.
She added that ""everyone is terrified from the current incitement"", and fears they will become ""scapegoats"".
Turkey and Russia have warned that the bloodshed, the worst since the toppling of Assad in December, threatens the stability of the entire region. Germany has urged Syria to avoid a ""spiral of violence"" after the clashes.
Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni.

Middle East correspondent","As dawn approached on the morning of 7 October 2023, many of the partygoers at the Nova music festival near Gaza's border took illegal recreational drugs like MDMA or LSD.
Hundreds of them were high when, shortly after sunrise, Hamas gunmen attacked the site.
Now neuroscientists working with survivors from the festival say there are early signs that MDMA - also known as ecstasy or molly - may have provided some psychological protection against trauma.
The preliminary results, currently being peer-reviewed with a view to publication in the coming months, suggest that the drug is associated with more positive mental states - both during the event and in the months afterwards.
The study, carried out by scientists at Israel's Haifa University, could contribute to a growing scientific interest in how MDMA might be used to treat psychological trauma.
It is thought to be the first time scientists have been able to study a mass trauma event where large numbers of people were under the influence of mind-altering drugs.
Hamas gunmen killed 360 people and kidnapped dozens more at the festival site where 3,500 people had been partying.
""We had people hiding under the bodies of their friends for hours while on LSD or MDMA,"" said Prof Roy Salomon, one of those leading the research.
""There's talk that a lot of these substances create plasticity in the brain, so the brain is more open to change. But what happens if you endure this plasticity in such a terrible situation - is it going to be worse, or better?""
The research tracked the psychological responses of more than 650 survivors from the festival. Two-thirds of these were under the influence of recreational drugs including MDMA, LSD, marijuana or psilocybin - the compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms - before the attacks took place.
""MDMA, and especially MDMA that was not mixed with anything else, was the most protective,"" the study has found, according to Prof Salomon.
He said those on MDMA during the attack appeared to cope much better mentally in the first five months afterwards, when a lot of processing takes place.
""They were sleeping better, had less mental distress - they were doing better than people who didn't take any substance,"" he said.
The team believes pro-social hormones triggered by the drug - such as oxytocin, which helps promote bonding - helped reduce fear and boost feelings of camaraderie between those fleeing the attack.
And even more importantly, they say, it appears to have left survivors more open to receiving love and support from their families and friends once they were home.
Clearly, the research is limited only to those who survived the attacks, making it hard to determine with any certainty whether specific drugs helped or hindered victims' chances of escape.
But researchers found that many survivors, like Michal Ohana, firmly believe it did play a role - and say that belief, in itself, may help them to recover from the event.
""I feel like it saved my life, because I was so high, like I'm not in the real world,"" she told me. ""Because regular humans can't see all these things - it's not normal.""
Without the drug, she believes she would have just frozen or collapsed to the floor, and been killed or captured by the gunmen.
Clinicians in various countries have already experimented with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a trial setting - though only Australia has approved it as a treatment.
Countries that have rejected it include the US, where the Food and Drug Administration cited concerns about the design of the studies, that the treatment may not offer long-lasting benefits, and about the potential risk for heart problems, injury and abuse.
MDMA is classified as a Class A drug in the UK, and has been linked to liver, kidney and heart problems.
In Israel, where MDMA is also illegal, psychologists can use it to treat clients on an experimental research basis only.
The preliminary findings from the Nova study are being closely followed by some of those Israeli clinicians experimenting with MDMA as treatment for PTSD after 7 October.
Dr Anna Harwood-Gross, a clinical psychologist and director of research at Israel's Metiv Psychotrauma Centre, described the initial findings as ""really important"" for therapists like her.
She is currently experimenting with using MDMA to treat PTSD within the Israeli military, and had worried about the ethics of inducing a vulnerable psychological state in clients when there is a war going on.
""At the beginning of the war, we questioned whether we were able to do this,"" she said. ""Can we give people MDMA when there's a risk of an air raid siren? That's going to re-traumatise them potentially. This study has shown us that even if there's a traumatic event during therapy, the MDMA might also help process that trauma.""
Dr Harwood-Gross says early indications of therapeutic MDMA use are encouraging, even among military veterans with chronic PTSD.
It has also upended old assumptions about the ""rules"" of therapy - especially the length of sessions, which have to be adjusted when working with clients under the influence of MDMA, she says.
""For example, it's changed our thoughts about 50-minute therapy sessions, with one patient and one therapist,"" Dr Harwood-Gross told me. ""Having two therapists, and long sessions - up to eight hours long - is a new way of doing therapy. They're looking at people very holistically and giving them time.""
She says this new longer format is showing promising results, even without patients taking MDMA, with a success rate of 40% in the placebo group.
Israeli society itself has also changed its approach to trauma and therapy following the 7 October attacks, according to Danny Brom, a founding director of the METIV Psychotrauma Centre at Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem, and a senior figure in the industry.
""It's as if this is the first trauma we're going through,"" he said. ""I've seen wars here, I've seen lots of terrorist attacks and people said, 'We don't see trauma here'.
""Suddenly, there seems to be a general opinion that now everyone is traumatised, and everyone needs treatment. It's a wrong approach.""
What broke, he said, is the sense of security many Jews believed Israel would provide them. These attacks uncovered a collective trauma, he says, linked to the Holocaust and generations of persecution.
""Our history is full of massacres,"" psychologist Vered Atzmon Meshulam told me. ""As a psychologist now in Israel, we are faced with an opportunity to work with lots of traumas that weren't previously being treated, like all our narratives for 2,000 years.""
Collective trauma, combat trauma, mind-altering drugs, sexual assault, hostages, survivors, body-collectors, the injured and the bereaved - Israel's trauma specialists are facing a complex cocktail of issues from the clients now flooding into therapy.
The scale of that mental health challenge is mirrored in Gaza, where vast numbers of people have been killed, injured or left homeless after a devastating 15-month war - and where there are scant resources to help a deeply traumatised population.
The war in Gaza, triggered by the Hamas attacks on Israeli communities in October 2023, was suspended in January in a six-week truce, during which Israeli hostages held by Hamas were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
But there is little sense on either side that the peace and security needed to begin healing has arrived.
The truce expired last weekend, with 59 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity. Many Gazans are waiting, with their bags packed, for war to resume.
Meanwhile Nova survivor Michal Ohana says she feels that with the passage of time, some are expecting her to have moved on from the attacks, but she is still affected.
""I wake up with this, and I go to sleep with this, and people don't understand,"" she told me.
""We live this every day. I feel the country supported us in the first months, but now after one year, they feel: 'OK, you need to go back to work, back to life.' But we can't.""

BBC News","Security forces of Syria's new rulers have engaged in heavy fighting with fighters loyal to deposed President Bashar al-Assad in a coastal area of the country.
It is the worst violence in Syria since rebels toppled Assad in December and installed an Islamist transitional government.
A war monitoring group, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said more than 70 people have been killed.
A curfew has been imposed in the cities of Latakia and Tartous, where the fighting has broken out.
BBC Verify confirmed the location of two videos posted online that showed gunmen shooting repeatedly at a building, igniting a fire inside, in the city of Homs on Thursday evening.
Two other verified videos show a body being dragged behind a car in Latakia.
The coastal region is the heartland of the Alawite minority, and a stronghold of the Assad family, which belong to the Alawite sect.
Estimations of the number of people killed in the violence vary, and the BBC has been unable to independently verify them.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday that 71 people had been killed, including 35 members of government forces, 32 gunmen affiliated to the former regime's army, and four civilians.
The clashes left tens of others injured, the human rights group said.
Gunmen, some from the former regime, had ambushed military forces, checkpoints and headquarters along the coastline, the organisation said.
One Sunni civilian witness called the attack ""planned and prepared"", while another told BBC Arabic that the indiscriminate firing on everyone including paramedics, was like something from the previous Assad regime.
""They did not have any mercy, so we are against any violence against anyone in the Syrian coast who has not been involve in this unrest. All of them are civilians and they are all like our family,"" they explained.
One Alawite said many Syrian people are ""scared"" regardless of if they were on the coast or in the capital.
Speaking to the BBC, she added that ""everyone is terrified from the current incitement"", and fears they will become ""scapegoats"".
Local gunmen took hold of military zones, where they holed up in areas in the Latakia mountains to launch attacks, while others holed up in Jableh city.
Members of the former regime army have been deployed in several coastal towns and villages, while military forces have been ambushed on highways.
Late on Thursday, Syrian-based Step news agency reported that government-aligned forces had killed ""about 70"" former regime fighters, while more than 25 others were captured in Jableh and the surrounding areas.
A spokesman for Syria's defence ministry, Colonel Hassan Abdul Ghani, issued a warning to Assad loyalists fighting in Latakia via state media.
""Thousands have chosen to surrender their weapons and return to their families, while some insist on fleeing and dying in defence of murderers and criminals. The choice is clear: lay down your weapons or face your inevitable fate,"" he said.
The region has become a major security challenge for interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa.
Alawite activists said their community had been subjected to violence and attacks since Assad fell, particularly in rural Homs and Latakia.
He is also facing resistance in the south, where there have been clashes with Druze forces in recent days.
Earlier this week, Syria's foreign minister told the global chemical weapons watchdog that the new government was committed to destroying any remaining stockpiles produced under-Assad.

BBC News","Syria's foreign minister has told the global chemical weapons watchdog that the new government is committed to destroying any remaining stockpiles produced under ousted president Bashar al-Assad.
Addressing a meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, Asaad al-Shibani vowed to ""put an end to this painful legacy, to bring justice to victims, and to ensure that the compliance with international law is a solid one"".
But he added that Syria would ""need the support of the international community"".
Assad's government denied ever using chemical weapons during the 14-year civil war, but activists accused it of carrying out of dozens of chemical attacks.
In 2013, rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were fired at several rebel-held suburbs in Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people. UN experts confirmed the use of the nerve agent sarin but they were not asked to ascribe any blame.
Assad denied his forces fired the rockets, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and allow a joint OPCW-UN mission to destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. However, questions about the accuracy and completeness of Syria's declaration remained.
The OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team documented multiple uses of chemical weapons during the war, identifying the Syrian military as the perpetrator of five cases of chemical weapons use in 2017 and 2018.
They included the April 2018 attack on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta, when a Syrian air force helicopter is believed to have dropped two cylinders filled with highly concentrated chlorine gas on two apartment buildings, killing at least 43 people.
An earlier OPCW fact-finding mission, which was not mandated to identify perpetrators, also found that chemical weapons were used or likely used in 20 other instances.
Last month, OPCW director general Fernando Arias visited Damascus to hold talks with Shibani and interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December.
At Wednesday's meeting, Arias declared that ""the evolving political landscape in Syria"" provided the international community with ""a new and historic opportunity to complete the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons programme"".
He said a team of technical experts from the OPCW would be deployed to Damascus in the coming days and begin planning visits to suspected chemical weapon sites.
Shibani also met the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, in The Hague on Wednesday.
The ICC said their talks ""followed up on the prosecutor's January visit to Damascus, exploring partnerships towards accountability for crimes committed in Syria"".
Syria is not a member of the ICC, but Khan has said the new government could accept the court's jurisdiction as a first step, as Ukraine has done with respect to the war with Russia.",Middle East

BBC News","Food prices in Gaza have risen sharply and aid food parcels could soon run out after Israel blocked the entry of humanitarian aid, the UN's humanitarian agency said.
OCHA's partners reported that flour and vegetable prices had more than doubled in some cases, with Gazans telling the BBC the same.
If the blockade continued, ""at least 80 community kitchens may soon run out of stock"" and remaining food parcels that ""will support 500,000 people, will soon run out"", OCHA said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chose to stop aid at the weekend, accusing Hamas of stealing supplies and refusing a US proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire. A Hamas spokesman said the halt was ""cheap blackmail"".
The foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza ""catastrophic"" and expressing deep concern at Israel's action.
""A halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza, such as that announced by the government of Israel would risk violating international humanitarian law,"" the statement read. ""Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool.""
The ministers said it was vital that the ceasefire was sustained, all hostages held by Hamas were released, and continued flows of aid were ensured.
Thousands of aid trucks had surged into Gaza each week under the ceasefire deal that started on 19 January.
After the ceasefire's first phase expired on Saturday night, Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of stealing aid ""to finance its terror machine"".
Hamas has previously denied stealing humanitarian aid in Gaza.
Netanyahu also said Hamas was refusing to accept a six-week ceasefire extension, under different terms from those previously agreed, as proposed by US President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After the halt of aid in response, OCHA said on Tuesday that some community kitchens which remain operational ""will need to start to adjust meal content or reduce the number of meals prepared to cope with anticipated shortages"".
Partners would also ""be forced to reduce food rations"". While they are distributing previously dispatched food parcels, remaining supplies are expected to run out.
Abu Qais Aryan, from Khan Younis, told BBC Arabic the cost of basic goods doubled over Sunday night. Prices had already doubled or tripled since the war began, he said.
Other residents said the price of a 1kg (2.2lb) of tomatoes rose overnight from five shekels ($1.38; £1.07) to 10, and a 1kg of cucumbers from six to 17 shekels.
""We could barely afford to buy a kilo of tomatoes just to satisfy our hunger,"" said one man, Issam, adding that people could not buy food ""because there is no cash liquidity"".
Issa Meit, from Gaza City, said there was a shortage of goods and very high consumption, and he was ""very afraid that prices will increase again"".
""The recent decision is unfair as it wrongs our children. How will our children live in light of these high prices that will increase in an arbitrary way?"" he said.
Some blamed merchants for hiking prices, saying they were exploiting the situation.
Merchant Mahmoud Abu Mohsen told BBC Arabic he raised prices because the wholesalers he purchases from did as well.
""For example, I used to buy sugar for five shekels, three shekels, or four shekels, but now I buy sugar for six shekels, meaning I don't make more than a small profit,"" he said. ""The news that Netanyahu announced is what caused a stir among the people.""
A spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Caroline Seguin, told the BBC on Wednesday that in Gaza City, the price of just over 2lb (900g) of sugar had risen from just over $1 (78p) to $5.
In Khan Younis and Gaza City, the cost of a carton of 30 eggs had shot up around 150%, she added.
""The news has created uncertainty and fear, causing food prices to spike,"" Ms Seguin said in an earlier statement. ""Israel is once again blocking an entire population from receiving aid, using it as a bargaining chip. This is unacceptable, outrageous, and will have devastating consequences.""
Qatar and Egypt, which helped mediate the ceasefire along with the US, condemned Israel's move.
Qatar's foreign ministry called the decision ""a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement"" and ""international humanitarian law"" in a statement.
Egypt's foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as ""a weapon against the Palestinian people"".
Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said in a video briefing that ""Hamas has hoarded for months and months of supplies. They have enough food to fuel an obesity epidemic.""
""The supplies are there but Hamas doesn't share,"" he added.
A month ago, OCHA said more than a million people - roughly half of Gaza's population - had received food assistance since the ceasefire began.
All aid, not just food, is affected by the blockade.
Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said that inside Gaza, it had some medicine in reserve for its clinics and assistive devices for people with disabilities, in addition to hygiene kits.
""However, we don't currently have high aid reserves as most items entering were for immediate distribution,"" the charity said.
Ms Seguin said even though it appeared MSF's medical supplies would last for a few months, ""it doesn't mean that we haven't been consistently running short of essentials"".
The main concern for the health system, she said, was fuel for generators at hospitals to ensure ventilators and other critical medical equipment continued to work.
She said ""the consequences will be at the cost of the people in Gaza"".
The ceasefire aimed to end 15 months of conflict, which erupted after Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.
Israel responded with an air and ground campaign in Gaza that killed at least 48,405 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",Middle East

Reporting fromAmman, Jordan","Rami Qattoush's mother beams with pride, as her nine-year-old son tentatively kicks a football for the first time since his injury.
It is a huge milestone in his recovery, since he travelled to Jordan last month after getting Israeli military approval to leave Gaza.
Rami dreams of playing football one day, like Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is still in pain and quickly tires, having to sit down on a plastic chair, exhausted from the effort.
His bandaged legs - one of them splinted - are badly scarred and withered.
Every step forward is hard.
Doctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs.
Warning - This article contains distressing content
The boys had been fast asleep in the family's third-floor flat in Maghazi in central Gaza when, their mother says, an Israeli air strike targeted the building next door, raining rubble and shrapnel on the children.
Rami's 12-year-old brother, Mustafa, was killed, his body blown to pieces.
His heart, pierced with shrapnel, was only found two days later, Islam says. The family gave it a separate burial.
The UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people.
Medical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment.
An estimated 30,000 Gazans – like Rami and Abdul Salam – have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization.
It has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people – among them 4,500 children – still need to be brought out for treatment.
""The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children,"" the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January.
Rami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved.
""Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'"" Islam says.
And then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman.
It is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more.
""It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war,"" says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. ""It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery.""
Rami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small ""School of the Future"", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner.
But he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him.
They're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can.
""Gaza is beautiful,"" Rami told me. ""In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped.""
With the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress.
""He arrived in a wheelchair,"" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again.
""He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud.""
He also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza.
But many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home.
Not knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna.
Sharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs.
He was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings. In hospital in Gaza, a nurse trying to cheer him up told him his mother had turned into a star.
""Since then, he looks up into the sky at night, looking for stars and talking to them,"" his aunt Sabah says. ""He doesn't talk to other people. But I hear him saying to the stars: 'Mummy I've eaten, Mummy I'm going to sleep now.'""
The psychological injuries of the hospital patients are often tougher than the physical.
""Some will never recover,"" says hospital director Roshan Kumarasamy, who says that reconstructive surgery will be needed on patients from Gaza for years to come because of an ""unimaginably massive spectrum of injuries"".
But Rami is strong and determined. When he breaks down in tears thinking of Mustafa, he reassures me it's ""OK"".
And when he and his mother manage to get through to his family in Gaza on a video call, Rami is eager to show them how he can now stand on his own two feet.
His father cheers him on, saying: ""Rami, you're a hero.""
And now his family have another reason to celebrate – Rami's brother, Abdul Salam, and his father have just been given permission by Israel to leave Gaza for Jordan as well.
In the weeks to come, he should be fitted with a new leg, allowing both injured boys to relearn how to walk.",Middle East

BBC News, Jerusalem","The level of destruction in Jabalia when viewed from the air is truly astonishing.
A Hiroshima-like wasteland stretches as far as the eye can see. The mangled carcasses of buildings dot the churned-up landscape, some leaning at crazy angles.
Great undulating waves of rubble make it all but impossible to make out the geography of this once bustling, tightly packed refugee camp.
And yet, as a drone camera flies over the wreckage, it picks out splashes of blue and white where small tent camps have been set up in patches of open ground.
And figures, clambering over broken buildings, moving along streets of dirt, where food markets are springing up under tin roofs and canvas awnings. Children using a collapsed roof as a slide.
After more than six weeks of Gaza's fragile ceasefire, Jabalia is slowly coming back to life.
In the neighbourhood of al-Qasasib, Nabil has returned to a four-storey house that's somehow still standing, even if it lacks windows, doors and - in some places - walls.
He and his relatives have made crude balconies out of wooden pallets and strung-up tarpaulin to keep out the elements.
""Look at the destruction,"" he says as he surveys Jabalia's ocean of ruins from a gaping upper floor.
""They want us to leave without rebuilding it? How can we leave. The least we can do is rebuild it for our children.""
To cook a meal, Nabil lights a fire on the bare staircase, stoking it carefully with pieces of torn-up cardboard.
On another floor, Laila Ahmed Okasha washes up in a sink where the tap ran dry months ago.
""There's no water, electricity or sewage,"" she says. ""If we need water, we have to go to a far place to fill up buckets.""
She says she cried when she came back to the house and found it wrecked.
She blames Israel and Hamas for destroying the world she once knew.
""Both of them are responsible,"" she says. ""We had a decent, comfortable life.""
Soon after the war began in October 2023, Israel told Palestinians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip – including Jabalia – to move south for their own safety.
Hundreds of thousands of people heeded the warning, but many stayed, determined to ride out the war.
Laila and her husband Marwan clung on until October last year, when the Israeli military reinvaded Jabalia, saying Hamas had reconstituted fighting units inside the camp's narrow streets.
After two months of sheltering in nearby Shati camp, Leila and Marwan returned to find Jabalia almost unrecognisable.
""When we came back and saw how it was destroyed, I didn't want to stay here anymore,"" Marwan says.
""I had a wonderful life, but now it's a hell. If I have the chance to leave, I'll go. I won't stay one more minute.""
Stay or go? The future of Gaza's civilian population is now the subject of international debate.
In February, Donald Trump suggested that the US should take over Gaza and that nearly two million Palestinian residents should leave, possibly for good.
Faced with international outrage and fierce opposition from Arab leaders, Trump has subsequently appeared to back away from the plan, saying he recommended it but would not force it on anyone.
In the meantime, Egypt has led Arab efforts to come up with a viable alternative, to be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday.
Crucially, it says the Palestinian population should remain inside Gaza while the area is reconstructed.
Donald Trump's intervention has brought out Gaza's famously stubborn side.
""If Trump wants to make us leave, I'll stay in Gaza,"" Laila says. ""I want to travel on my own free will. I won't leave because of him.""
Across the way sits a nine-storey yellow block of flats so spectacularly damaged it's hard to believe it hasn't collapsed.
The upper floors have caved in entirely, threatening the rest. In time, it will surely have to be demolished, but for now it's home to yet more families. There are sheets in the windows and washing hanging to dry in the late winter sunshine.
Most incongruously of all, outside a makeshift plastic doorway on a corner of the ground floor, next to piles of rubble and rubbish, stands a headless mannequin, wearing a wedding gown.
It's Sanaa Abu Ishbak's dress shop.
The 45-year-old seamstress, mother of 11, set up the business two years before the war but had to abandon it when she fled south in November 2023.
She came back as soon as the ceasefire was announced. With her husband and daughters, she's been busy clearing debris from the shop, arranging dresses on hangers and getting ready for business.
""I love Jabalia camp,"" she says, ""and I won't leave it till I die.""
Sanaa and Laila seem equally determined to stay put if they can. But both women speak differently when they talk of the young.
""She doesn't even know how to write her own name,"" Laila says of her granddaughter.
""There's no education in Gaza.""
The little girl's mother was killed during the war. Laila says she still talks to her at night.
""She was the soul of my soul and she left her daughter in my hands. If I have the chance to travel, I will do so for the sake of my granddaughter.""",Middle East

BBC News correspondent","Actor Khalid Abdalla says he has been told to attend a police interview following a pro-Palestinian protest in January.
Abdalla, who played Dodi Fayed in Netflix series The Crown, said on social media he had received a letter from the Metropolitan Police on Thursday.
The Metropolitan Police confirmed to the BBC that eight people had been ""invited to be interviewed under caution at a police station"" as part of an ""ongoing investigation into alleged breaches of Public Order Act conditions on Saturday 18 January"".
In an Instagram post, Abdalla said it remained to be seen if charges would result, adding that ""the right to protest is under attack in this country"".
Abdalla, who also starred in United 93, The Kite Runner and The Day of the Jackal, is one of Hollywood's most outspoken actors on the Gaza-Israel war. He has publicly called for a permanent ceasefire.
The actor has attended several pro-Palestinian demos, including the one on 18 January he will be interviewed by the police about.
And he was a signatory to the Artists for Palestine UK open letter to the BBC in February, criticising the corporation's decision to pull a documentary about children's lives in Gaza after it discovered its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.
Abdalla is not the first public figure to face a police interview following the January rally.
The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have already been questioned by officers.
The Met has not identified the pair but said at the time that two men, aged 75 and 73, had subsequently been ""released pending further investigations"".
A static rally involving several thousand people took place in Whitehall after police blocked plans to hold a march from Portland Place, near the headquarters of the BBC.
Police said conditions had been clearly communicated that those taking part in the protest should remain in Whitehall.
""Despite this, a large group made its way from Whitehall into Trafalgar Square and in some cases attempted to go further.""
Police said that a number of people in that group have been arrested on suspicion of breaching the conditions - and that so far, 21 had been charged.
The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, which organised the protest, said: ""What is claimed by the police as justification for this massive overreach of their powers is a complete misrepresentation of what took place, not just on the day but beforehand.""
And it added: ""We demand that the Metropolitan Police halt any prosecutions or proceedings against those involved in this entirely peaceful protest.""",Middle East

BBC News","An Israeli man has been killed and four other people have been wounded in what police say was a terrorist stabbing attack in the northern Israeli city of Haifa.
Police said an Israeli Druze man attacked civilians with a knife after getting off a bus at HaMifratz Central station. He was shot dead at the scene by a security guard.
The victim who died was named as Hassan Dahamsha, 70, from the predominantly Arab town of Kafr Kanna. Paramedics said three of the wounded - a 15-year-old boy, and a man and a woman in their 30s - were in a serious condition.
The attacker was from Shfaram, another mainly Arab town, and had recently returned from abroad, police said, without specifying a motive.
Israeli Druze leaders condemned the rare attack by a member of their community.
The Druze are an ethnic and religious group whose faith is an offshoot of Shia Islam. About 150,000 live in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, comprising about 1.5% of the population.
Witnesses and security officials said the perpetrator of Monday morning's attack travelled to Haifa on a bus from Shfaram, which is about 10km (6 miles) east of the city.
""A bus arrived, and someone got off with a knife, shouted 'Allahu Akbar' ['God is greatest' in Arabic], and started stabbing people indiscriminately,"" one woman told the Haaretz newspaper.
A security officer was cited as saying the attacker stabbed three people waiting at the station and then went to a security checkpoint, where he stabbed an elderly man before being shot dead by the guard.
A police spokesman said the attacker had been abroad for the past few months and had returned to Israel in February.
Israeli media named him as Yitro Shaheen, 20, and reported that he had German citizenship and had lived in Germany.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""My wife Sara and I send our deepest condolences to the family of the man who was murdered in the shocking terrorist attack in Haifa.
""We will continue to fight everywhere against those who seek to murder us and we will defeat them.""
The spiritual leader of Israel's Druze community, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, also condemned the attack. But he added: ""Before passing judgment, it is important to wait for a thorough investigation and full clarification of the facts by the security forces.""
Druze lawmaker Hamad Amar of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party insisted that the attack ""does not reflect the true spirit of the Druze community in Israel, which is a full partner in defending the state and its values"".
Shfaram's mayor, Nahid Khazem, also said the town's residents were deeply shocked by the ""despicable crime"" in Haifa.
""His extended family say that he was mentally unstable, but I have no documents to confirm this,"" he told Haaretz.
There was no immediate claim from any armed groups, but Hamas described the attack as ""heroic"" and a ""natural response"" to what it called Israeli crimes against Palestinians.
It comes amid deadlock between Hamas and Israel over moving forward with the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire deal.
Israel stopped aid from entering Gaza after Hamas rejected what Netanyahu's office said was a US proposal for an extension to the first phase, which ended on Saturday night.
Hamas accused Israel of reneging on the deal and said the second phase should go ahead as agreed.",Middle East

BBC News","A British-Israeli hostage released by Hamas after 15 months in captivity has said her scars represented ""freedom, hope and strength"" as she underwent a series of surgeries for her injuries.
Emily Damari, 28, was shot in the hand as she was dragged from her home in southern Israel during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, causing her to lose two fingers.
She said an operation in Gaza had left her in ""intense pain"" for a year and a half, and that a scar from an ""open, festering wound"" did not heal for months due to the conditions in which she was held.
Ahead of her treatment, Ms Damari said she had ""fully embraced"" the pain and injuries because of what they symbolise to her.
Ms Damari was held by Hamas in Gaza for 471 days prior to her release. She was one of the first hostages to be freed as part of a ceasefire deal struck between the Palestinian armed group and Israel after 15 months of fighting.
She was taken from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, near the Gaza border, on the morning of Hamas's unprecedented attack.
Ms Damari was also shot in the leg, and previously said she had only received an out-of-date bottle of iodine to treat her wounds while in captivity.
The 28-year-old said the complex operations on her hand and leg in Israel's Sheba Medical Center had gone ""much better than expected"".
She said the scar on her hand was ""looking better"" and that the pain, caused by ""the nerves being sewn together"" in Gaza, had gone.
Now, with the help of physiotherapy, she hoped to have improved use of her hand.
But Ms Damari noted that her recovery would take time and her hand would ""never fully recover"".
She said the conditions in which hostages were being held were ""unimaginable"".
""It was shocking but not surprising to see how emaciated some of the other hostages were when they came out,"" she reflected.
""Hamas has created hell on Earth,"" she said, adding that there were others whose mental and physical health was ""in much worse shape"" than hers. She called for the release of all remaining hostages without delay.
Ms Damari's mother, who grew up in Beckenham in south-east London, added that her daughter had been ""sewn up like a pin-cushion"" in Gaza.
""It is nothing short of a miracle that she did not contract a life-threatening infection,"" said Mandy Damari.
Ms Damari said she was ""so excited"" to visit the UK with her mother once she had healed and the remaining hostages are released.
""I have so many people that I want to thank personally for helping me get my life back.""
The pair have been invited to Downing Street by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who previously spoke to Ms Damari over the phone.
During that conversation, she said she had been held at United Nations facilities during her captivity. The UN's Gaza agency has called for an independent investigation into the allegation.
In total, 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and a further 1,200 people were killed.
The attack triggered a war which has devastated Gaza. Israel's military offensive killed at least 48,365 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

BBC News, London and Jerusalem","Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza as it demands Hamas agree to a US plan for a ceasefire extension.
The first phase of a truce deal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US expired on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas was refusing to accept a temporary extension proposed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
A Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was ""cheap blackmail"" and a ""coup"" on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene.
The ceasefire deal halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
The internationally-mediated ceasefire plan - originally proposed by Joe Biden - envisages three stages.
The first phase came into force on 19 January and expired on Saturday.
Negotiations on phase two, meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, were due to have started weeks ago, but have barely begun.
Phase three is meant to result in the return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years.
Hamas has previously said it will not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from the mediators that phase two would eventually take place.
As the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday, Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed to Witkoff's proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods.
If, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war.
Witkoff has not made his proposal public. According to Israel, it would begin with the release of half of all the remaining living and dead hostages.
Witkoff is said by Israel to have proposed the temporary extension after becoming convinced that more time was needed to try to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas on conditions for ending the war.
A statement from Netanyahu's office said: ""With the end of Phase 1 of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks - to which Israel agreed - Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease.
""Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.""
The Hamas spokesman said: ""Netanyahu's decision to stop aid going into Gaza once again shows the ugly face of the Israeli occupation... The international community must apply pressure on the Israeli government to stop starving our people.""
Aid agencies confirmed that no aid trucks had been allowed into Gaza on Sunday morning.
""Humanitarian assistance has to continue to flow into Gaza. It's very essential. And we are calling all parties to make sure that they reach a solution,"" Antoine Renard from the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC.
Thousands of trucks entered the Gaza Strip each week since the ceasefire was agreed in mid-January.
Aid agencies have managed to store supplies, which means there is no immediate danger to the civilian population from this morning's Israeli decision.
Egypt has called for the previously agreed upon ceasefire deal to be implemented in full.
The Egyptian foreign minister said his country would present a plan to rebuild Gaza without displacing its people at an emergency Arab summit on Tuesday.
Also on Sunday, medics said four people had been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza. The Israeli military said it had attacked people who were planting an explosive device in the north of the territory.
There are believed to be 24 hostages alive, with another 35 presumed to be dead.
Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage.
Israel responded with an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Middle East

Diplomatic correspondent
Reporting fromJerusalem","Where next? The first six-week phase of the Gaza ceasefire ends on Saturday.
The 42 days since 19 January have seen their fair share of uncertainty, hope, grief and anger, but everything that should have happened in that time has.
Israeli hostages - the living and the dead - have been released. Palestinian prisoners set free.
But negotiations on phase two, including the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, have barely begun.
Talks opened in Cairo on Friday but Israel's delegation returned home in the evening.
Reports suggested that negotiations would continue ""at a distance"" and that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold late-night consultations with the delegation, senior ministers and intelligence chiefs.
For such a meeting to take place late on the sabbath was highly unusual. No statements emerged from the consultations, with reports suggesting they would continue on Saturday night.
Israel appears to be looking to extend the current phase for another six weeks, to get more hostages back and release more Palestinian prisoners but without withdrawing its troops.
The government here is adamant that Hamas, the group responsible for the massacres of 7 October 2023 and the taking of 251 hostages, has to lay down its arms and relinquish any form of authority in the Gaza Strip.
Israel also says it is not yet ready to leave the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border - a process that should have begun on Saturday.
""We will not allow the Hamas murderers to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling,"" an unnamed Israeli official said in a statement sent to reporters on Friday.
Such anonymous quotes are often believed to come directly from the prime minister's office.
Last summer, efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza faltered when Netanyahu insisted on keeping Israeli troops stationed along the Philadelphi corridor.
On Friday night, Hamas said it would not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that phase two would eventually take place.
Hamas seems determined to remain a force in Gaza, even if it might be willing to hand over day-to-day governance to other Palestinian actors, including the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority.
Egypt has been working on a reconstruction plan for Gaza, as an alternative to Donald Trump's proposal to take the area over and evacuate its entire civilian population.
But Western diplomats are not optimistic that the plan, due to be unveiled at an Arab League summit in Cairo next Tuesday, has the sort of robust security and governance arrangements that will be needed to meet Israeli demands.
This is a critical moment.
For all the emotional turmoil of the last few weeks, Israelis have come to expect the gradual release of hostages. There are believed to be 24 alive, still waiting to be freed, with another 39 presumed to be dead.
Israelis desperately want them all back, without the sort of propaganda displays that have disgusted and infuriated the entire country.
If the whole process now grinds to a halt, public anger – at Hamas and their own government - will mount. Further street protests are planned, including one on Saturday night in the place in Tel Aviv that all Israelis now know as Hostages Square.
""We demand the return of all 59 remaining hostages by day 50 of the agreement,"" reads the invitation from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum HQ.
""Now is our only window of opportunity – we won't get another.""
UN Secretary General António Guterres has weighed in, urging the parties ""to spare no effort to avoid a breakdown of this deal"".
On Saturday evening, Israelis were once again horrified by the sight of hostages being paraded in front of the cameras, in a video released by Hamas.
In the latest in a long line of cruel, harrowing videos released over the past 16 months, five Israeli hostages are seen, two of them with their faces blurred.
Two of the hostages, Iair Horn and Sagui Dekel Chen, were released two weeks ago.
In the video, Iair is seen embracing and saying goodbye to his younger brother, Eitan, suggesting the scene was filmed shortly before Iair and Sagui were released.
The emotions are raw and the scene deeply distressing, with both brothers in tears and Eitan pleading to Benjamin Netanyahu to stick with the ceasefire deal and release all remaining hostages.
The video is clearly designed, once again, to play on the frayed emotions of the Israeli public and heap pressure on the Israeli prime minister.
In a statement released by his office, Netanyahu accused Hamas of producing ""another cruel propaganda video in which our hostages are forced to engage in psychological warfare.""
Israel, the statement said, would not be deterred by Hamas propaganda.
""We will continue to act relentlessly for the return of all of our hostages and until all objectives of the war are met.""
There's a widespread belief that, sooner or later, the war will begin again.
It's a bleak prospect, for the hostages and for two million Palestinians in Gaza who are trying to put their lives back together in the current, fragile peace.
In a place where families are still digging bodies from the rubble, sometimes with their bare hands, the thought of a resumption of a conflict which has already claimed tens of thousands of lives is chilling.
Areas in the middle of the Gaza Strip that have so far escaped the worst of the conflict would likely suffer badly from any return to war, making it even harder to sustain life in this ravaged strip of land.",Middle East

BBC News
Reporting fromJerusalem","Israel's military has published its first official account of the mistakes that led to its failures during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war.
The report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ""failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians"".
The 19-page report contains much that is already known about what led to catastrophic loss of about 1,200 lives when approximately 5,000 gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups stormed into Israel, also taking 251 hostages in the process.
There are no dramatic revelations, but it is still sobering to see the military's conclusions about how it misjudged Hamas's intentions and underestimated its capabilities laid out in black and white.
The report says the military regarded Gaza as a secondary security threat, with priority given to Iran and Hezbollah. Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was ""paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative"".
The military had chosen a ""conflict management"" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was ""neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war"" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.
Evidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as ""unrealistic or unfeasible"", reflecting ""Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat"".
The report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas's plan was not merely a vision but ""a concrete framework for operational planning"".
However, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.
The report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed.
""There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?"" the report says.
Over time, ""a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality"" had developed.
The report also highlights what it says was ""a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history"".
It calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, ""fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement"".
It says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.
The Gaza Division, it says, ""was effectively defeated for several hours"" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively.
It says the Air Force responded quickly, but that ""there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists"".
The report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians.
After presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures.
""I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,"" he said in a video.
Last month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war.
His critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault.
Israel responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Middle East

BBC News","Israel has completed forensic tests confirming the identities of four dead Israeli hostages whose bodies were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
On Wednesday night, Hamas passed four coffins to the Red Cross from Gaza. Israel's prime minister confirmed on Thursday that they contained the remains of Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69, and said all four men had been murdered.
The handover cleared the way for the delayed release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
It was the last exchange of the six-week-long first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, leaving questions over what happens next.
Hamas has said it is ready to start delayed indirect negotiations on the second phase, which aims to end the war and secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who faces pressures from his political allies to resume fighting and crush Hamas - said he had instructed negotiators to depart for Cairo on Thursday for talks.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,365 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter.
Hamas handed over the four men's bodies late on Wednesday night, with no public ceremony, unlike in previous exchanges during the current ceasefire.
Israeli authorities carried out initial forensic testing close to the Israel-Gaza border before transferring the remains to the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv.
It came after the body of a Palestinian woman from Gaza was handed over by Hamas to Israel instead of the body of hostage Shiri Bibas last week, prompting fury in Israel. Hamas said it was a mistake and transferred Bibas's body the following day.
Following the identification of the bodies received overnight, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that military officials had informed the Mansour, Yahalomi, Idan and Elgarat families that their loved ones ""were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel"".
""Pursuant to the intelligence and all of the information at our disposal, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat were murdered while held hostage in Gaza,"" it added.
""Shlomo Mansour was murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip.""
There was no immediate response to the allegations from Hamas.
Tsachi Idan was taken by Hamas gunmen from his home in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. His eldest child, Maayan - who had just turned 18 - was shot and killed in front of her siblings and parents.
His family said that ""the unbearable journey to bring back our beloved and dear Tsachi from the inferno in Gaza has ended with the identification of his body"".
Itzik Elgarat was kidnapped from Nir Oz, another kibbutz, and reportedly shot in the hand during the attack.
Ohad Yahalomi, a French-Israeli dual national, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023.
Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour was killed by Hamas at Kibbutz Kissufim on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage.
His sister, Hadassah Lazar, told Israel's Channel 12 that ""we've reached an absurd situation where we take comfort in receiving a body to bury"". But, she added: ""The circle is not yet closed. We will continue fighting until the last hostage returns home.""
President Isaac Herzog said: ""Together with the entire nation, we share in the immense grief and sorrow of the bereaved families and [their] communities.
""The return of our brothers' bodies from captivity underscores our moral obligation to do everything in our power to bring back all the hostages - the living to their loving families, and the fallen to be late to rest.""
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the hostages' families, insisted that Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat could have returned alive if the Israeli government had agreed to the ceasefire deal sooner.
""[They] endured a prolonged period in Hamas captivity in Gaza. They should have returned alive; they could have been saved and brought back through an agreement.""
It urged Israel's leaders to ensure the return of the 59 hostages remaining in captivity - 35 of whom are presumed dead - by the start of next week, warning that they ""have no time left"".
Netanyahu promised Israeli authorities would ""act relentlessly until we bring everyone back"".
Following the handover of the hostages' bodies, buses carrying Palestinian prisoners were seen leaving Ofer prison in the north of the occupied West Bank and then arriving in Ramallah, where a large crowd gathered to celebrate their release.
""We have been taken out of suffering as if we have been dug out from our own graves. No prisoner has had the experience of having their own release delayed twice,"" one of the prisoners, Yahya Shrida, told reporters.
""What we have been through is a situation that the mountains can't carry. It is very hard to explain.""
Later, dozens more Palestinians were seen getting off buses outside the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.
Many of them said they had endured harsh conditions while in detention.
""During the first period in jail, we were handcuffed and blindfolded for 90 days, you see no-one and no-one sees us. And we used to sit on our knees or on our buttocks for 18 or 20 hours,"" Eyad al-Saudi said.
He added: ""We left behind young detainees, and our joy will not be complete until the remaining detained prisoners are released from prison.""
The Israeli military and prison service have previously said that detainees and prisoners are treated in accordance with the law.
The Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said a total of 642 Palestinians in Israeli jails were supposed to be released in the exchange.
Among them were 445 Gazans who were detained by Israeli forces without charge during the war and 46 women and children, it said. The 151 prisoners include dozens convicted of carrying out deadly attacks on Israelis who are being sent abroad.
Israel had delayed the releases since last Saturday in protest at what it said were ""Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"".
Hamas said Israel's decision was a ""blatant"" violation and said indirect talks about further steps in the ceasefire deal were conditional on the prisoners being released.
After days of impasse, Egyptian mediators secured the new exchange, with the Israeli prime minister's office saying the hostages' bodies would be handed over ""in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies"".
A Hamas official meanwhile said the handover would take place ""without public presence to prevent the occupation from finding any pretext for delay or obstruction"".
It remains unclear whether the truce will be extended or progress to a planned second phase, which would see the release of all remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.
Indirect negotiations for the second phase were due to start earlier this month but they have not yet got under way.
Hamas affirmed the group's ""full commitment to the ceasefire agreement"" on Thursday and its ""readiness to enter into negotiations for the second phase"".
Later, the Israeli prime minister's office said he had ""instructed the negotiation delegation to depart for Cairo today to continue the talks"", without giving any details.
""Our delegation will go to Cairo and see whether we have a common ground to negotiate,"" Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters.
""We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more hostages. If it is possible we'll do that.""",Middle East

BBC News","Israel and Hamas say the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza will be returned on Wednesday night, after mediators resolved the latest ceasefire dispute.
Israel is set to free in exchange 602 Palestinian prisoners, whose release it had delayed since last weekend in protest at what it said was the cruel treatment of hostages being handed over by Hamas.
The Israeli prime minister's office announced the four bodies would be returned ""without Hamas ceremonies"", while the Israel Prison Service said it was preparing to free prisoners and detainees from Gaza.
Hamas also confirmed the exchange, and the Prisoners' Media Office said a hospital in Gaza was preparing to receive released Palestinians.
This would clear the way for US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to visit the region. He has said he wants Israel and Hamas to begin delayed talks on the second stage of the ceasefire, with the first due to expire on Saturday.
News of the breakthrough came as thousands of Israelis gathered along roads in central and southern Israel to watch the funeral procession of hostages Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, whose bodies were returned by Hamas last week.
They were killed in captivity after being kidnapped during Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has said they were murdered by their captors, rejecting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike.
On Tuesday night, Hamas said a delegation led by the group's Gaza leader, Khalil al-Hayya, had concluded talks with Egyptian officials in Cairo after reaching an agreement to resolve the problem over the delayed release of the Palestinian prisoners.
""They will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli [hostages] agreed to be handed over during the first phase, in addition to the corresponding Palestinian women and children,"" it added.
Hayya also reiterated that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK, and other countries - was committed to the ceasefire deal ""with all its stages and clauses"".
Israeli officials also said an agreement had been reached with the mediators, but it was not until Wednesday afternoon that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office put out a brief statement confirming that.
""Four of our deceased hostages will be returned tonight in the framework of the first stage, in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies,"" it said, without naming them.
The spokesman of Hamas's military wing later announced: ""Within the framework of the deal, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades has decided to hand over the bodies of four [hostages] tonight.""
He identified them as Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69.
The Israel Prison Service confirmed it was ""making preparations for the process of releasing imprisoned terrorists in accordance with the agreement"".
Operational units would escort the Palestinian prisoners and detainees to Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank, and Ketziot prison in southern Israel, where they would be identified by the Red Cross and await the handover of the Israeli hostages, a statement said.
Once their release was approved, they would be driven by the Red Cross to release points in the West Bank and the Kerem Shalom crossing with southern Gaza, it added.
The Palestinian Prisoners' Media Office meanwhile said the European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis was preparing to receive those returned to Gaza.
It has previously said the 602 Palestinians include 445 Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war and 50 prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails.
They should have been released last Saturday in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, including Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas.
However, the Israeli prime minister's office said early on Sunday that the release would be postponed ""in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"".
Hamas said Israel's decision was a ""blatant"" violation and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released.
A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase lasting six weeks.
So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released. Both Israel and Hamas have said the last four hostages are dead. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside of the deal.
The agreement has seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to the north, and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day.
The ceasefire's second phase should see the 59 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent ceasefire.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

BBC News, West Bank","""The army forced us out. Me, my wife and family. We took nothing with us.""
Alaa Ofi is trying to figure out how to manage his drastically changed circumstances.
""We left behind our documents, clothes and everything we had at home.""
It's been a month since the Israeli army raided the Tulkarm refugee camp, causing thousands of residents to flee.
At the local Palestinian governor's office we found displaced camp residents looking for assistance.
Some were struggling to find affordable places to rent. Others, like Mr Ofi, needed to retrieve important belongings but had been prevented from returning to their homes by the Israeli army.
""My wife is expecting a baby next week,"" Mr Ofi said. ""I can't take her to hospital because I need insurance papers and my ID, but they were left behind at home.""
What Israel is calling ""Operation Iron Wall"" against Palestinian armed groups has triggered an exodus of around 40,000 people from four camps in the north of the occupied West Bank: Tulkarm, Nur Shams, Jenin and Far'a.
Aid agencies are calling it the largest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank since it was captured by Israeli forces during the 1967 Six Day War.
It's also the first time any of the camps, which were established in the early 1950s for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during Israel's War of Independence, have been almost completely evacuated.
Since the operation began in January, Israeli forces have ploughed up roads and demolished homes.
On the eastern edge of Tulkarm camp, a broad scar is visible where once there were tightly packed houses. Israeli soldiers can be seen patrolling what now looks like a street.
Elsewhere, roads into the camp have been churned up, armoured bulldozers creating piles of earth and pools of muddy rainwater. Pavements and shop fronts have been left mangled.
A concrete UN sign that used to stand over the camp's now impassable main entrance has been knocked down.
At least 51 Palestinians, including seven children, have been killed by Israeli forces in the northern West Bank since the beginning of the operation, according to the UN.
Three soldiers have also been killed by Palestinian gunmen, one of them during an exchange of fire in Jenin and two others in an attack on a checkpoint in Tubas, it says.
The Israeli army says it's tackling Palestinian militant groups, based inside the camps - groups it blames for a string of roadside bomb attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.
On Sunday, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said the army was ""at war with Islamic terrorism in Judea and Samaria"" - the term Israel uses to describe the West Bank.
He said he had instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ""to prepare for a prolonged stay in the camps that have been cleared for the coming year"".
At the same time, Katz ordered tanks to take up positions in Jenin camp and the surrounding city, for the first time in more than 20 years.
Beyond underlining the government's tough message, it's not clear what role the four tanks will perform.
""The IDF is operating within very complex urban environments,"" a military official said, on condition of anonymity.
""We've done that in Gaza, we've done that in the villages of southern Lebanon,"" the official said, referring to Israel's wars with Hamas and Hezbollah.
""We're doing that in those neighbourhoods in Judea and Samaria because of the threat that we're facing.""
Military officials say there have been no orders to evacuate civilians.
""The IDF has allowed local residents who wish to distance themselves from combat areas to leave safely through designated crossings,"" the army said in a statement.
But residents of the camps say they were forced to leave, some of them under fire.
Others say instructions to leave were delivered by drone.
One video from Jenin shows a drone flying over the camp, seemingly broadcasting a message.
""Get out of your homes, the army will be here,"" the message says.
The recently-appointed Palestinian governor of Tulkarm, Dr Abdullah Kmeil, calls Operation Iron Wall ""a declaration of war"".
""You are talking about an operation of destruction,"" he told the BBC. ""Financial and mental destruction of the residents. These are things the Israelis have planned precisely.""
The aim, he says, is to create ""a hostile environment"" for the camps' residents, in the hope that they leave and are absorbed into the general Palestinian population.
In the meantime, Palestinians find themselves struggling with a host of new difficulties, large and small.
In the village of Qabatiya, just south of Jenin, we found a driver frantically trying to reverse out of a muddy pothole left by Israeli bulldozers that had dug up the street.
His car was stuck in the middle of the road, holding up traffic in both directions.
In the centre of a nearby roundabout, a miniature replica of Jerusalem's iconic Dome of the Rock had been smashed to pieces.
Despite Israel Katz's warning, no-one knows how long the operation, and the restrictions on civilians, will last.
""If we can't go back to our house for a year, it's going to be a disaster,"" says Alaa Ofi.
""We'll be left stranded in the streets with the kids.""",Middle East

Middle East correspondent
Reporting fromJerusalem","In a display of deep public grief, thousands of Israelis, many with orange balloons and Israeli flags, lined the roads of southern Israel for the funeral procession of three hostages who were killed in captivity in Gaza - Shiri Bibas, and her two red-haired sons, Ariel and Kfir.
Israeli TV channels carried a live feed of the scenes and - after a private burial - the public eulogies by relatives, with crowds gathering to watch on large screens in Tel Aviv's Hostages' Square.
""This trio settled in my heart, and I believe in all of our hearts,"" a woman called Neta told Channel 12. She said she had come from the north to pay her final respects to the Bibas family at the procession.
""I set out this morning at 04:30. I saw that I couldn't fall asleep, so I headed south. I wanted to come here to be as close as possible to the Gaza border communities, to be part of this farewell.""
Kfir, aged nine months, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was the youngest of the 251 hostages snatched in the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks. His brother, Ariel, was just four.
Images of the two boys became among the most recognisable symbols of the struggle to return the hostages.
There was deep anguish in Israel at the sight of Yarden Bibas, Shiri's husband, being released by Hamas at the start of this month without his immediate family.
On Wednesday, Yarden Bibas paid tribute to Shiri, who was 32, as ""the most amazing wife and mother"", saying he would always love her.
""I want to tell you everything that's happening in the world and here in Israel,"" he went on. ""Shiri, everyone knows us and loves us. You have no idea how surreal this madness is.""
Wearing an orange kippah, or skullcap, he shared touching memories of his children and spoke of how he and his wife had been happily surprised on giving birth to their second red-headed boy.
The Israeli president's residence was lit up in orange - the colour that has come to represent the family.
At the procession's start, the Bibas family thanked Israelis for their show of support and expressed longing for days ""when we can once again gather in moments of joy, not sorrow"".
Wrapped in an orange flag to watch the convoy of cars passing en route to the cemetery, Shontal expressed sympathy with the bereaved.
""I wanted to come and be close to them, to offer my condolences to Yarden and the family. I hope he manages to recover - not only from the captivity he endured but also from grasping and understanding this terrible tragedy,"" she told Channel 12. ""His tragedy is all of ours.""
A haunting video of Shiri Bibas was filmed during the Hamas assault in southern Israel over 16 months ago.
She appears terrified as she clutches onto her children surrounded by armed men before they are taken away from their home. Hours later, surveillance camera footage showed them in Khan Younis.
In November 2023, Hamas said that an Israeli air strike in Gaza had killed Shiri and her sons. However, that was never verified by the Israeli military, which only expressed ""serious concern"" for them.
As recently as last week, the Bibas family continued to hold out hope that the mother and her sons could be returned to Israel alive. They asked the public to ""refrain from eulogising our loved ones"" until a government post-mortem examination was completed.
Then, last Friday, after the first handover of the remains of dead hostages by Hamas since its deadly 2023 attack, under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal, news came through that devastated many Israelis.
The Bibas boys were dead, their identities confirmed by DNA tests. The Israeli military spokesman said pathological exams and intelligence showed they had been murdered by their captors ""with their bare hands"".
In addition, the remains of Shiri Bibas were not found in the coffin labelled with her name that had been handed to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
This was said to contain the remains of a Palestinian woman from Gaza instead. Hamas suggested that there may have been a mix up in the aftermath of the Israeli bombardment.
Two days later, the Bibas family announced that Shiri's body had been returned to Israel and that she too had been murdered in captivity.
The upsetting confusion over the bodies, along with the grim handover ceremony for the dead hostages staged by Hamas, were among what Israel said were truce violations, leading it to postpone the agreed release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners last Saturday.
Hamas responded that this was a ""serious violation"" by Israel which threw the ceasefire process into a new crisis.
Hours before the funeral, Israeli and Hamas officials said the crisis had been resolved by mediators, with the bodies of another four Israeli hostages now expected to be returned later on Wednesday or on Thursday at the same time as the Palestinian prisoners are freed.
However, the fallout triggered fresh anxiety for the relatives of some 60 remaining hostages who remain unsure if their loved ones - or their bodies - will ever be returned from Gaza.
A pledge by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avenge the Bibas family's deaths only increased their relatives' worries.
The family have criticised the Israeli media and Netanyahu for ignoring their wishes not to release more details of the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths.
In a Facebook post on the eve of the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy, the sister of Yarden Bibas, told the prime minister to ""shut up"" after he repeatedly described the murders. She said publication of the information was ""outright abuse of a family that has gone through 16 months of hell and still has the worst ahead"".
The Bibas funeral came a day after that of Oded Lifshitz, who was also from Nir Oz and was 83 when he was abducted. His body was also returned last week. Netanyahu has said he was murdered in captivity by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Shiri Bibas and her children were buried in a single casket next to the final resting place of her parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, who lived in the same kibbutz and were killed there on 7 October.
In total, some 1,200 people were killed on Israel's deadliest ever day. It ignited the deadliest ever war in Gaza, in which more than 48,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
At the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy called on Israeli officials seeking forgiveness for their failure to protect Shiri, Ariel and Kfir that day to instead hold themselves accountable.
""Forgiveness means accepting responsibility and committing to act differently, to learn from mistakes. There is no meaning to forgiveness before the failures are investigated, and all officials take responsibility.

BBC Persian","To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.
This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.
But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain.
As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.
A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.
IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.
Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.
At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).
As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.
But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.
For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. ""Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,"" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. ""It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.""
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.
Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.
Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.
As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.
Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: ""Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.""
In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.
Newrouz Ahmad says that having ""defeated IS in Kobane… we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too"".
At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. ""I am 60,"" he says.
It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.
And now the threat of another battle is looming.
Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.
In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.
She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.
The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing. The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.
""An old man next to me was also injured,"" she tells me from her bed.
""I lost some blood… but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,"" she adds.
Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an ""apparent war crime"" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.
The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that ""reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth"" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a ""conflict-ridden area on purpose"" to use them as ""human shields… in order to not to lose control on the said dam"".
It accused the SDF of using ""violence and terror"" to pursue ""its own separatist agenda"", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.
Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.
The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.
But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies – Turkey.
And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.
Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.
But the two sides have still not reached an agreement.
""In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,"" he says, adding: ""In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.
""But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,"" he says.
For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.
Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.
But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.
It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.
""If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,"" he warns. ""That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.""
There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.
The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.
""So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,"" she says. ""Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?""
Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.
""If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?"" she asks.
So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?",Middle East

BBC News","At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say.
Doctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition.
The family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight.
The PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters.
The Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago. Israel has denied this.
Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times during the 16-month war between Israel and Hamas and almost 70% of buildings in the territory are estimated to be damaged or destroyed.
The healthcare system has also collapsed, with only 18 of the 35 hospitals partially functional and shortages of essential medical equipment.
According to meteorological websites, the night-time temperature in Gaza has regularly fallen below 10C (50F) over the past two weeks.
It dropped to 3C (37F) on Monday night, after the PFBS hospital's medical director Dr Saeed Salah had warned in a video that three babies suffering from cold injuries, including hypothermia, had died over the same period.
He said the babies were only one or two days old, and had weighed between 1.7kg and 2kg (3.7-4.4lbs).
On Tuesday, Dr Salah and a paediatrician at the hospital, Dr Samer Lubad, reported that another two newborns had died.
""The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with case that they call 'cold injury' or hypothermia,"" Dr Lubad told Al Jazeera TV.
""Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home. There is still one baby in our neonatal ICU in a critical general condition.""
He added: ""Of course, this condition is because of the cold weather and lack of safe shelters, lack of central heating, and lack of electricity in the Gaza Strip.""
Meanwhile, the head of the paediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis told the Associated Press that it had received the body of a two-month-old girl who had died of hypothermia on Tuesday.
A video posted by a local journalist appeared to show the girl being buried by her father and uncle, who said she was named Sham Yousef al-Shambari.
He said she had been healthy and that her mother had found her ""stiff as wood from the cold"" when she tried to wake her for feeding during the night inside the family's tent in the al-Mawasi area.
Dr Muneer al-Boursh, director general of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said in a statement a total of 15 children had died due to the cold since the start of the winter.
He also alleged that Israel had ""failed to comply with humanitarian protocols, including allowing the entry of medical equipment, heating supplies, tents, and mobile homes"" since the ceasefire began on 19 January.
Hamas has previously said that Israel was required to allow in about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans during the six-week-long first phase of the deal.
Israeli military body Cogat said Israel was ""committed to and complies with the obligation to allow the entry of 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks per week"" into Gaza, including those carrying tents and shelter supplies.
""Based on the data available to us, hundreds of thousands of tents have entered the Gaza Strip since the agreement came into effect,"" it added.
It comes amid continued uncertainty over whether the ceasefire will continue past Saturday, when the deal's first phase is set to expire.
On Sunday, Israel postponed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for 10 hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, accusing the group of cynically using its hostages for propaganda purposes.
Hamas accused Israel of a ""blatant"" violation of the deal and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",Middle East

BBC News","Syria's interim president has told a national dialogue conference that the country has a ""historic"" opportunity to rebuild after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.
Ahmed al-Sharaa also stressed the need for armed groups to integrate into the military and for the state to have a monopoly on weapons, saying Syria's ""strength lies in its unity"".
The 600 delegates have been asked to provide recommendations on transitional justice, the economy, the new constitution and other topics to guide a new transitional government.
But there has been criticism that the process has been rushed, and the Kurdish-led militia alliance and autonomous administration which control north-eastern Syria were not invited.
The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist, with Bashar becoming president in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez.
In 2011, Bashar brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.
On 8 December, he fled to Russia after a rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept down from north-western Syria and entered Damascus in the space of only 12 days.
Seven weeks later, Sharaa was named president for the ""transitional period"" by his fellow rebel commanders. They also announced the cancellation of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, army and security agencies, and the integration of all rebel groups into the new state institutions replacing them.
Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to discuss Syria's future, which he said would be followed by a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve during the transition.
""Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it to build itself on its own,"" Sharaa said in a speech at the national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday.
""What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country.""
The organising committee said six working groups would be formed to discuss a transitional justice system, the new constitution, reforming and building state institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society, and the country's future economic model.
The groups would agree non-binding recommendations, which would be presented to the new transitional government set to take power on Saturday and help shape the constitutional declaration, according to the committee.
Sharaa said a transitional justice body would soon be formed to ""restore people's rights"" and start holding to account those who committed crimes against Syrians during the civil war.
He also reiterated that non-state armed groups had to disarm and hand over their territory.
""The unity of arms and their monopoly by the state is not a luxury but a duty and an obligation,"" he said. ""Syria is indivisible; it is a complete whole, and its strength lies in its unity.""
The interim government's forces control Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by various armed groups.
They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance supported by the US, which controls most of the north-east and serves as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES).
The SDF has so far refused to integrate its forces into the new Syrian army, although negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks.
Organisers of the conference said the SDF and AANES had not been invited because of that refusal, and that Kurds would be represented in Damascus even if they were not.
However, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami told AFP news agency that ""the exclusion of the SDF and large sections of Syrian society confirm that the conference serves to please the outside world and not to seek a better future"".
Thirty-five parties in the AANES also criticised what they claimed was the ""token representation"" of Kurds and other minorities, saying such events were ""meaningless, worthless, and will not contribute to finding real solutions to the country's ongoing crisis"".
Moutasem Sioufi of The Day After, an independent civil society group that is participating in the conference, told the BBC that it was important that all groups were involved.
""We need to have dialogue with all the Syrian groups, with all Syrian powers, especially those who have great influence on the ground. Without that Syria would face a very hard time maintaining itself together,"" he said.
The outcomes of the conference will be closely watched by the international community, which has called for an inclusive political process that represents the country's many ethnic and religious communities.
During the civil war, the US, the UK, and the European Union imposed a wide range of sanctions on Syria targeting Assad's government and its allies in response to atrocities committed during the civil war.
They have lifted some of the sanctions that crippled the Syrian economy since Assad's fall, but made further steps dependent on Syria's new leaders keeping promises to respect minority rights and move towards democracy.
On Monday, the EU announced that it was suspending sanctions on its energy, transport and banking sectors to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction.
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani welcomed that decision, but he criticised the international sanctions still in place in a speech to the national dialogue conference.
""These sanctions are illegitimate and are not based on any legal or moral foundations,"" he said. ""They are being used as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people.""
HTS, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, is subject to separate sanctions because it continues to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK.",Middle East

BBC Middle East analyst
Reporting fromJerusalem","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the complete demilitarisation of much of southern Syria.
It is an announcement that could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria, after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, more likely.
In a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to ""enter the area south of Damascus"".
""We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime,"" he added. ""Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.""
He also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy.
Until now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side.
The rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum.
But with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger.
Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so in 2019.
Syria's new interim President, HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, has tried to reassure Israel that he does not want conflict and that he is ready to uphold the long-standing disengagement agreement between the two countries concluded after another war in 1973.
He has also stressed that he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks against Israel.
But Sharaa has also called on Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it has taken, as he tries to assert sovereignty across the whole of Syria's fractured landscape.
Clearly, Netanyahu does not trust these assurances.
Like much of the international community, the Israeli prime minister is waiting to see if Sharaa makes good on his moderate, emollient stance in action as well as words.
From the perspective of the new Syrian leadership, freeing the country from the influence of all the foreign powers that jockeyed for position during the long years of civil war is seen as vital to ensuring a more positive future for the country and a definitive break with the past.
Some foreign players, such as Iran and Russia, have seen for now at least the curtailment of the overweening influence they once had.
Under President Donald Trump, the US might also further disengage from Syria - a role which has helped underpin Kurdish-led forces in the north-east of the country.
There has, though, been growing influence from Turkey - which provided essential support for HTS in its lightning campaign against Assad.
How big a part it chooses to play could be a determining factor in how Syria develops in the post-Assad era.
But Israel may present a more immediate challenge to the independence of Syria's new leadership.
To have Israeli troops increasingly infringing on the country's territory - as well as carrying out numerous strikes on targets associated with what's left of Assad's military arsenal - does not fit with the vision of a re-unified, sovereign state that Sharaa is trying to convince Syrians both inside and outside the country that his leadership can provide.
Netanyahu's move to forbid Syrian forces from operating freely within the country's borders may be a step too far for the new order in Damascus to stomach, however non-confrontational an image it is trying to maintain.",Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw7rrlvmjo,Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners,2025-02-24T16:12:21.962Z,"David Gritten
BBC News","Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed.
Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including ""humiliating"" handover ceremonies.
A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to ""grave danger"" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel.
The deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun.
UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was ""precarious"" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs.
He also called for the ""dignified release of all remaining hostages"".
On Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages.
As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel.
Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a ""sickening display of cruelty"".
There was already fury in Israel after Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.
It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day.
Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys ""with their bare hands"", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike.
Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails.
They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers.
In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed ""in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"".
""It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies.""
Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a ""blatant violation"" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released.
""We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,"" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday.
Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that ""all options are on the table"".
""Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],"" he added.
""Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?""
Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released.
The White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an ""appropriate response"" to what it called the ""barbaric treatment"" of hostages by Hamas.
But President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting ""an extension of phase one"".
""We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,"" he told CNN on Sunday.
A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase.
So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal.
The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day.
The ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0dv7rxxvo,The unseen map that promised to bring peace to the Middle East,2025-02-24T01:04:43.214Z,"Paul Adams
Diplomatic correspondent","""In the next 50 years, you will not find one Israeli leader that will propose to you what I propose to you now.
""Sign it! Sign it and let's change history!""
It was 2008. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was imploring the Palestinian leader to accept a deal he believed could have brought peace to the Middle East.
It was a two-state solution - a prospect which seems impossible today.
If implemented, it would have created a Palestinian state on more than 94% of the occupied West Bank.
The map Olmert had drawn up now has an almost mythical status. Various interpretations have appeared over the years, but he has never revealed it to the media.
Until now.
In Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October, the latest series from documentary filmmaker Norma Percy available on iPlayer from Monday, Olmert reveals the map he says he showed to Mahmoud Abbas at a meeting in Jerusalem on 16 September 2008.
""This is the first time that I expose this map to the media,"" he tells the filmmakers.
It shows, in detail, the territory which Olmert proposed to annexe to Israel - 4.9% of the West Bank.
That would have included major Jewish settlement blocs - just like previous proposals dating back to the late 1990s.
In return, the prime minister said Israel would give up an equal amount of Israeli territory, along the edges of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The two Palestinian territories would be connected via a tunnel or highway – again, something that had been discussed before.
In the film, Olmert recalls the Palestinian leader's response.
""He said: 'Prime minister, this is very serious. It is very, very, very serious.'""
Crucially, Olmert's plan included a proposed solution to the thorny issue of Jerusalem.
Each side would be able to claim parts of the city as their capital, while administration of the ""holy basin"" - including the Old City, with its religious sites, and adjacent areas - would be handed over to a committee of trustees consisting of Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the US.
The implications of the map, for Jewish settlements, would have been colossal.
Had the plan been implemented, dozens of communities, scattered throughout the West Bank and Jordan Valley, would have been evacuated.
When the previous Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, forcibly removed a few thousand Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was regarded as a national trauma by those on the Israeli right.
Evacuating most of the West Bank would have represented an infinitely greater challenge, involving tens of thousands of settlers, with the very real danger of violence.
But the test never came.
At the end of their meeting, Olmert refused to hand over a copy of the map to Mahmoud Abbas unless the Palestinian leader sign it.
Abbas refused, saying that he needed to show his experts the map, to make sure they understood exactly what was being offered.
Olmert says the two agreed to a meeting of map experts the following day.
""We parted, you know, like we are about to embark on a historic step forward,"" Olmert says.
The meeting never happened. As they drove away from Jerusalem that night, President Abbas's chief of staff, Rafiq Husseini, remembers the atmosphere in the car.
""Of course, we laughed,"" he says in the film.
The Palestinians believed the plan was dead in the water. Olmert, embroiled in an unrelated corruption scandal, had already announced that he was planning to resign.
""It is unfortunate that Olmert, regardless of how nice he was… was a lame duck,"" Husseini says, ""and therefore, we will go nowhere with this.""
The situation in Gaza also complicated matters. After months of rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory, Olmert ordered a major Israeli assault, Operation Cast Lead, at the end of December, triggering three weeks of intense fighting.
But Olmert tells me it would have been ""very smart"" for Abbas to sign the deal. Then, if a future Israeli prime minister tried to cancel it, ""he could have said to the world that the failure was Israel's fault"".
Israeli elections followed in February. Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, a vocal opponent of Palestinian statehood, became prime minister.
Olmert's plan, and map, faded from view.
The former prime minister says he's still waiting for Abbas's reply, but his plan has since joined a long list of missed opportunities to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In 1973, the former Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, quipped that the Palestinians ""never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity"". It's a phrase that Israeli officials have frequently repeated in the years since.
But the world is more complicated than that, especially since the two sides signed the historic Oslo Accords in 1993.
The peace process ushered in by a handshake on the White House lawn between former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had moments of genuine hope, punctuated by tragedy. Ultimately, it resulted in failure.
The reasons are complex and there's plenty of blame to go around but in truth, the stars were never properly aligned.
I witnessed this non-alignment at first hand 24 years ago.
In January 2001, at the Egyptian resort of Taba, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators once again saw the outlines of a deal.
A member of the Palestinian delegation drew a rough map on a napkin and told me that, for the first time, they were looking at the rough outlines of a viable Palestinian state.
But the talks were irrelevant, drowned out by the violence raging on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza, where the second Palestinian uprising, or ""intifada"", had erupted the previous September.
Once again, Israel was in the midst of a political transition. Prime Minister Ehud Barak had already resigned. Ariel Sharon comfortably defeated him a few weeks later.
The map on the napkin, just like Olmert's map eight years later, showed what might have been.",Middle East

BBC News","Large crowds have gathered for the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut in September.
Mourners dressed in black flocked to a stadium on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital on Sunday. They also paid their respects to Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, who was killed in a separate Israeli strike before he could assume his post.
Nasrallah, the former leader of the Lebanese militant Shia Islamist group, was one of the most influential figures in the Middle East.
Hours before the funeral began at 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT), Israel launched air strikes in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers.
People braved the cold to attend the funeral, which was held at the 50,000-capacity Camille Chamoun Sports City stadium.
Nasrallah's coffin was draped in Hezbollah's flag and paraded along with Safieddine's casket through huge crowds of black-clad mourners.
Excerpts of Nasrallah's speeches were played to the gathered supporters, who chanted, waved flags and held portraits of the leaders.
Hezbollah's current leader, Naim Qassem, addressed mourners via video link from an undisclosed location, saying Hezbollah remained ""strong"" and ""would not submit"".
One mourner, 55-year-old Umm Mahdi, told the AFP news agency that the funeral was the ""least we can do"" for Nasrallah, ""who gave up everything"" for his cause.
Prior to his death, he had not been seen in public for years because of fears of being assassinated by Israel.
The late leader had close personal links to Iran and played a key role in turning Hezbollah into the political and military force it is today. He was revered by the group's supporters.
Under Nasrallah's 30-year leadership, Hezbollah - which is banned as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and other countries - helped train fighters from the Palestinian armed group Hamas, as well as militias in Iraq and Yemen, and obtained missiles and rockets from Iran for use against Israel.
He died aged 64 in Dahieh, a closely-guarded suburb of Beirut. After Nasrallah's death, Hezbollah allowed open access to the area for the first time for a public memorial.
The mass funeral is an apparent show of strength for Hezbollah, which suffered a series of major setbacks during Israel's campaign in Lebanon last year.
Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that Israeli planes were flying over the stadium while the funeral took place to ""convey a clear message: whoever threatens to destroy Israel - that will be the end of them"".
Israel's incursion into Lebanon came after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza.
Lebanon was subject to an intense Israeli air campaign and a ground invasion of the country's south.
Dozens of senior figures were killed when Israeli-made walkie-talkies were detonated in a surprise attack in September 2024.
Many of Hezbollah's most senior military and political leaders were also killed during the latest conflict with Israel.
The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to more than 1.2 million residents being displaced before a ceasefire deal was struck in November.
Representatives from Iran, Iraq and Yemen attended the funeral, which was delayed to allow time for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon - though some troops still remain.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the slain leaders as ""two heroes of the resistance"" in a speech.",Middle East

BBC News","Israel has expelled the residents of three refugee camps in the occupied West Bank as it steps up a major month-long operation in the Palestinian territory.
Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said the camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams were now ""empty"" and would be occupied by the Israeli military for the coming year.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has deployed a tank division around the city of Jenin - the first time it has done so since 2002. The Palestinian Authority condemned the move.
The UN said earlier this month that Israel's operation, which began on 21 January and was intensified in recent days, had led to the ""forced displacement"" of 40,000 people.
""So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams, which are now empty of residents,"" Israel Katz said in a statement.
""I have instructed [troops] to prepare for a prolonged presence in the cleared camps for the coming year and to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism.""
He also said that Israel had instructed the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) to stop operating in the area.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described the decision to deploy tanks as a ""dangerous Israeli escalation that will not lead to stability or calm"".
The IDF said in a statement that its forces are ""continuing the operation to thwart terrorism"" and are expanding their ""offensive activity"" - which so far has involved drones, tanks, special forces, border police, and operatives from the intelligence agency Shin Bet.
The UN said on Thursday that since Israeli operations began on 21 January, 51 Palestinians, including seven children, have been killed in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas governorates, as well as three Israeli soldiers.
The offensive has caused severe damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, disrupting access to water to ""tens of thousands of people"", it said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Tulkarm refugee camp on Friday and ordered the army to intensify ""operational activity"", his office said.
""We are entering terrorist strongholds, flattening entire streets that terrorists use, and their homes. We are eliminating terrorists, commanders,"" Netanyahu said.
His visit followed the explosion of three buses in Tel Aviv, which Israeli officials described as a ""suspected terror attack"" that was caused by bombs of the kind previously found in the West Bank.

BBC Middle East analyst
Reporting fromJerusalem","As the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is meant to be drawing to an end, it has once again been put in doubt.
After the last six living Israel hostages due to be released in this phase were freed, more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were due to be released by Israel in exchange - the biggest number so far to be freed in one go.
But that has now been delayed indefinitely by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with his demand that Hamas must stop what he called its ""cynical use of hostages for propaganda purposes"". Hamas has in turn accused Israel of deliberately trying to disrupt the ceasefire agreement.
It's the latest big bump in the road that's intended ultimately to lead to a permanent end to hostilities and the start of rebuilding Gaza.
Israel complained about the chaotic scenes in one of the first handovers, saying the physical safety of the hostages had been put in jeopardy. Then, Israel said Hamas had broken the terms of the agreement by not releasing a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehud.
In response, it delayed opening access for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza for 48 hours. That was resolved when Arbel Yehud was freed in an extra handover before the next scheduled for the following Saturday.
Hamas later accused Israel of not living up to its commitments to permit heavy machinery, tents and caravans into Gaza. It then said it would not carry out the next hostage handover as scheduled.
That prompted threats from both Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump that all out war would resume in Gaza if the hostages weren't freed as agreed. With the clock ticking down, Hamas agreed to release them.
And just in the past few days, the discovery that the body Hamas handed over on Thursday as that of Shiri Bibas turned out not to be her. That set off new anger and shock in Israel, where the images of Shiri trying to shield her two young children as they were abducted on 7 October, 2023, is seen as the most potent symbol of the horror of that day.
Netanyahu denounced Hamas for what he called a ""cruel and evil violation"" of the agreement. Once again, the ceasefire was kept on track only at the last moment by Hamas providing another body within a day that this time did indeed prove to be hers.
All these incidents have shown how fragile the ceasefire process remains. They may also have contributed to the fact talks on the second phase - due to start earlier this month - have not yet got under way. Time is running out, with the first phase due to end in a week's time.
Hamas has offered to release the remaining hostages due to be freed in the second phase in one go, but only if Israel pulls all its forces out of Gaza and there is a permanent end to the war.
Israel has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas, which it has so far rejected. The stage-managed ceremonies at each hostage handover, which Netanyahu has so strongly condemned, are intended to show it is still a force to be reckoned with in Gaza.
In Israel, voices on the right demand the government resumes its war against Hamas, while the families of the hostages - backed by much of Israel - say securing the release of the remaining hostages is what matters above and beyond all else.
Trump's plan for Gaza has brought new uncertainty into the equation. The third phase of the ceasefire is meant to set Gaza on the path towards reconstruction and renewal.
Arab states are hurriedly trying to come up with a concrete alternative proposal in which Palestinians would continue to live in Gaza while it is rebuilt, rather than being removed from the enclave as envisaged in Trump's plan.
The future governance of Gaza also remains a key sticking point, with Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries all so far appearing to have contradictory proposals.
These issues will require difficult negotiations, which will be conducted amid the constant risk of a return to war, for which some on both sides continue to advocate.

Reporting fromLondon","Israel says it is indefinitely delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners, in another potentially major setback in the ceasefire process.
Benjamin Netanyahu said the release was now going to be delayed until the next handover of hostages by Hamas was guaranteed - and without what the Israeli prime minister called the degrading ceremonies Hamas has put on each week.
Only one more handover - of the bodies of four hostages who died in captivity - is due to take place in the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is due to end on 1 March.
No arrangements for the release of other living hostages, due to take place in the second phase, have yet been made.
Delegations from Israel and Hamas were due to negotiate the exact terms of the second phase while the first was ongoing - but have yet to meet.
Mediators will be working overtime to get the deal back on track and avert a possible collapse, after both Israel and Hamas accused one another of breaking the terms of the agreement.
Netanyahu accused Hamas of ""repeated violations"", including the ""cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes"".
In response, Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq strongly condemned the decision to postpone the release of the prisoners in a statement on Sunday morning.
He said that Israel's claim that the handover ceremonies were humiliating was a ""false claim and a flimsy argument"" aimed at evading its obligations under the ceasefire agreement.
Netanyahu's statement came after four hostages taken captive on 7 October - Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen and Omer Wenkert - were released on Saturday.
The two other released hostages, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, were held in Gaza for years - Mr Mengistu since 2014 and Mr al-Sayed since 2015.
In exchange, Israel was supposed to release 602 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement by delaying the release.
The six Israeli hostages are the final living hostages to be returned as part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement.
Meanwhile, outside the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, family and friends waited for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
According to Palestinian authorities, 50 prisoners who were going to be released were serving life sentences, 60 had long sentences, and 445 were detained by Israel since 7 October.
There are 62 hostages taken on 7 October 2023 still being held by Hamas, about half of whom are believed to be alive.
Hamas began releasing hostages, facilitated by the Red Cross, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners after the ceasefire agreement took effect on 19 January.
Initial chaotic scenes have become more choreographed, with hostages flanked by fighters on stages before the handovers.
On Saturday, Mr Shoham, 40, and Mr Mengistu, 39, were passed to the Red Cross in Rafah in southern Gaza before being transferred to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Mr Shoham was visiting family at Kibbutz Be'eri in October 2023 when he and others, including his wife and two children, were kidnapped by Hamas. His captured family members were released after 50 days.
In a statement, his family said: ""This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us.""
Mr Mengistu, who is Ethiopian-Israeli, had been held by Hamas since September 2014 when he crossed into northern Gaza.
He and Mr al-Sayed, a Bedouin Arab Israeli who entered Gaza in 2015, had both suffered with mental health problems in the past, according to their families.
Mr al-Sayed's release was conducted privately in Gaza City on Saturday.
""After nearly a decade of fighting for Hisham's return, the long-awaited moment has arrived,"" his family said in a statement.
""During these days, we need privacy for Hisham and the entire family so we can begin to care for Hisham and ourselves.""
Separately, at Nuseirat in central Gaza, Mr Shem Tov, 22, Mr Cohen, 27, and Mr Wenkert, 23, were freed in another public show by Hamas.
All three were taken captive at the Nova music festival.
Mr Shem Tov had initially escaped by car when Hamas fighters descended on the festival, but was captured when he went back to rescue his friends.
Mr Cohen had hidden with girlfriend Ziv Abud in a shelter at the festival, but was found and driven away. The shelter was bombed, but Ms Abud survived and escaped.
Mr Wenkert managed to send text messages to his family when festival-goers were being attacked, to tell them he was going to a safe shelter, but they lost contact with him.
Crowds in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square greeted the public releases with cheers as they watched them unfold on a live feed.
Families celebrating the return of the six men called for all remaining hostages to be released.
""Our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will... return all hostages home,"" Mr Shoham's family said.
Remaining hostages include Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier captured on 7 October.
His mother, Yael Alexander, who was watching Saturday's hostage release, told the BBC it was ""amazing"" to see them freed, but for her family it is ""very tough"" waiting.
""There are more than dozens of young men alive, like my son, still waiting to be released,"" she said. ""This is the main goal, to release the live people now from Gaza.""
Saturday's joyful scenes contrasted with earlier this week, when the bodies of hostages Shiri Bibas, her two young sons and another captive Oded Lifschitz were returned to Israel.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages.
Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",Middle East

BBC News","Israel's forensic officials have confirmed a body handed over by Hamas on Friday is that of hostage Shiri Bibas - but have rejected Hamas's claim that she was killed by Israeli bombing.
Dr Chen Kugel, director of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said an examination found ""no evidence of injuries caused by bombing"".
On Friday, Israel said that the two children of Shiri Bibas - Ariel and Kfir - had been killed with ""bare hands"" and that evidence of this had been sent to Israel's partners around the world. The BBC has not seen or verified this evidence.
Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence.
""Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home,"" the Bibas family said in a statement.
The remains of Ariel, Kfir and another hostage, Oded Lifschitz, were handed over by Hamas on Thursday - alongside a fourth body which it said was that of Shiri Bibas. Israel's forensic testing then showed that these remains were in fact of a different unidentified woman.
Hamas spokesman Ismail al-Thawabta said in a post on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after the air strike.
Hamas released the correct remains on Friday evening.
The Bibas family said: ""For 16 months, we sought certainty, and now that we have it, there is no comfort in it, but we hope for the beginning of a closure.""
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press conference ""forensic findings"", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested Ariel and Kfir had been killed ""deliberately"".
He said evidence had been shared with ""partners around the world so they can verify it"".
Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months respectively when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.
They were taken hostage along with the children's father, Yarden Bibas, 34, who was released alive by Hamas on 1 February.
Under the first phase of a ceasefire deal, which began on 19 January and lasts for 42 days, Hamas agreed to hand over 33 hostages in return for Israel freeing 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.
On Saturday, the armed group released Eliya Cohen, 27, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shohan, 40, and 23-year-old Omer Wenkert - all of whom were taken during the 7 October attacks.
Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengitsu, who was captured by Hamas in 2014, was also released. Hisham al-Sayed, a Bedouin Arab-Israeli held in Gaza since 2015, was handed over separately. Israel is due to free 602 Palestinian prisoners.
In subsequent stages of the agreement, Hamas will release the remaining living hostages from Gaza and return the bodies of dead hostages. Israel has pledged to release more Palestinian prisoners.
In the 7 October attacks, about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said ""forensic findings"", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested the boys had been killed with ""bare hands"".
He said evidence had been shared with Israel's ""partners around the world so they can verify it"".
Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence.
The bodies of the two boys were returned to Israel on Thursday, alongside the body of another hostage, Oded Lifschitz. Hamas said a fourth body handed over was that of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas - but Israel said forensic testing showed it was not her.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged Hamas ""put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin"" instead of the body of Shiri Bibas.
The IDF posted on X that ""during the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body.""
""This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organisation, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages.""
A Hamas spokesman, Ismail al-Thawabta, said on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under the rubble of a structure after an Israeli air strike.
The group told Reuters news agency they would investigate what had led to the wrong remains being sent to Israel.
Israel demanded that Hamas return Shiri along with the other remaining hostages.
""Whether she is alive or not, they need to bring back Shiri Bibas,"" IDF international spokesperson Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
Netanyahu said ""we will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages - both living and dead - and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement"".
In a statement, Hamas said it affirmed its ""seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations"" and had no interest in ""non-compliance"".
Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.
They have become a symbol for many in Israel and the news that their bodies would be returned to Israel was met with an outpouring of grief.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it was ""horrified and devastated"" that Shiri had not been returned, ""despite the agreement and our desperate hopes"".
The children's father Yarden Bibas, 34, was released by Hamas on 1 February.
Israel has confirmed that the fourth body returned on Thursday was that of veteran peace activist, Oded Lifschitz.
The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January, and Israel has confirmed it expects eight bodies will be handed over.
The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire.
Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month, but have not yet begun.
Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged.
Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.

Special correspondent","Kfir and Ariel Bibas were last seen on 7 October with their mother Shiri's hands around them, holding onto her boys surrounded by gunmen and violence, trying to protect them. She couldn't.
According to the Israeli army, Kfir and Ariel's last moments were at the ""bare hands"" of their captors.
How do you eulogise children who have barely lived their lives?
Kfir Bibas, a hostage at just nine months old, did not live to take his first steps or celebrate his first birthday.
Ariel Bibas had only experienced four years of a life that should have been much longer.
A statement from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the boys were taken hostage from, described Kfir as ""a calm and smiley baby, with ginger hair and a laugh that would make anyone's heart melt. Wherever he went he lit it up with his smile and joy.""
Ariel, they said, was ""a playful boy with ginger hair, curious eyes and a big smile. He loved superheroes, tractors and cars, and ran non-stop, climbing and exploring the world.""
The two brothers became the greatest symbol of the hostage nightmare Israelis are enduring. Bringing home the Bibas family was a country's fervent hope.
Throughout the last 16 months they have been remembered, prayed for, kept in the hearts of people, not just in Israel but by Jews and others across the world.
Images were shared of the boys in their Batman costumes with Ariel's cape flying in the wind; of older brother Ariel hugging his baby brother Kfir when he was born; of Kfir giggling and gurgling as his father Yarden played with him.
And then the image seared into the minds since Hamas's attack on 7 October: the boys clutching onto their mother Shiri Bibas, her face tormented in fear, as they were surrounded by gunmen and taken to Gaza.
No one in Israel wanted this ending; where Kfir and Ariel returned, not to their innocent childhood, but with their tender years already over. And where their mother who protected them until the last moment has not even returned with them.
In Israel, there is communal pain and grief.
In a video statement, the Israeli Prime Minister said Ariel and Kfir Bibas and 84-year-old Oded Lifschitz, whose body was also returned on Thursday, were ""brutally murdered by Hamas savages.""
Holding up a picture of the boys, Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Today is a tragic day. It's a day of boundless sorrow, of indescribable pain.
""Their bodies return home to a nation in mourning. A nation that will never forget and never forgive the evil that cut down these beautiful souls…The Bibas children in particular became the symbol of who we are, and who we're fighting against.""
Netanyahu said: ""Who kidnaps a little boy and a baby and murders them? Monsters. That's who.""
Israel's President Isaac Herzog said in a statement: ""Agony. Pain. Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters."" He asked for forgiveness on behalf of the country for not protecting them and bringing them home.
Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the 7 October attacks.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attacks and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
This week, in Israel and abroad, people across social media posted images of broken orange hearts to represent the boys with the striking ginger hair.
On Thursday, as the vehicles with the bodies of the Bibas children and Oded Lifschitz crossed into Israel, people lining the streets with Israeli flags shouted out ""sorry"".
In October 2023 just weeks after they were kidnapped, the aunt of the Bibas brothers spoke to the BBC.
Ofri Bibas Levy described how Kfir had just started crawling and eating solid food.
""They are civilians and are not supposed to be there. The longer they are there the harder it's going to be to recover them and the less chance they're going to come out alive,"" she said.
On Friday she wrote on Facebook: ""I'm sorry Luli [Ariel], I'm sorry Firfir [Kfir].
""You did not deserve any of this. We will miss you forever. We are not giving up on your mum Shiri.""
In a video statement she added: ""Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were taken alive by a murderous terrorist organization, and it was Israel's responsibility and obligation to bring them back alive.
""There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7 and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment. For Ariel and Kfir's sake, and for Yarden's sake, we are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri.""
Yarden Bibas, who was only recently released as a hostage, must now bury his two young boys, with his wife Shiri still not returned by Hamas.
In Israel they are quoting words that painfully resonate: ""The smallest coffins are the heaviest.""",Middle East

BBC's Middle East analyst
Reporting fromJerusalem","Israel's announcement that a body returned from Gaza on Thursday was not that of Shiri Bibas, as Hamas had said, throws up another stumbling block in this ceasefire deal.
It was thought the remains of Shiri, a mother of two, had been handed over along with those of her children.
But the Israeli military said forensic testing could only confirm the bodies of Ariel and Kfir, who would have been aged five and two, and not those of their mother.
Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had ""put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin"", with Ismail al-Thawabta, a spokesman for Hamas, suggesting Shiri's remains had been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after an Israeli air strike.
In a separate statement, the group said it affirmed its ""seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations"" under the ceasefire - and that it had ""no interest in non-compliance"".
It also said an investigation was under way, and called for the remains of the alleged Palestinian woman mistakenly handed over to Israel to be returned.
The Bibas family were among 251 people taken hostage during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, along with Shiri's husband, Yarden, who was released earlier this month.
Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Ariel and Kfir, the youngest of the Israeli hostages, were aged four and nine months when they were kidnapped. Their mother was 32.
Netanyahu has threatened that Hamas will pay the ""full price"" for failing to hand over Shiri's body, calling it a ""cruel and evil violation"" of their agreement.
No measures have yet been announced beyond Netanyahu saying Israel will act ""with determination to bring Shiri home"".
But a further claim from Israel that Ariel and Kfir had been ""murdered by terrorists in cold blood"" will further inflame feelings in Israel.
In November 2023, Hamas claimed the boys and Shiri had been killed in an IDF air strike. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.
On Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed forensic tests had revealed that Hamas killed Ariel and Kfir ""with their bare hands"".
""Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities,"" he said, without giving specifics about the alleged injuries. Hamas has not yet responded to these accusations.
For Israeli politicians inside and outside Netanyahu's government who have been demanding a resumption of the war in Gaza, these claims will be seen as more evidence that Hamas must be utterly eradicated.
The ceasefire is entering a new period of uncertainty, with the first phase drawing to an end - while negotiations on the next stage have yet to begin in earnest.
The second phase - in which all the remaining hostages, alive or dead, are due to be released - has been seen from the start as potentially more challenging than the first one.
Israel is demanding the complete disarmament of Hamas, while Hamas rejects the prospect of Israel continuing to maintain tight security control over Gaza.
Any major breakdown in the deal could see a return to fighting.
On the other side, though, is perhaps the majority of public opinion in Israel - that nothing should get in the way of all the remaining hostages being returned.
In expressing his condemnation of the latest developments, Israel's President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel must remember what he called its ""highest duty - to do everything in our power to bring every one of our kidnapped sisters and brothers home"".
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum echoed this, saying ""every step"" must be taken with ""careful responsibility"" to ensure the safe return of all hostages.

Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire after forensic testing revealed the body returned on Thursday was not Shiri.

However, Israel said on Thursday intelligence and forensics show the boys ""were brutally murdered by terrorists in captivity in November 2023"".

The events of recent days ""emphasizes the urgent need to bring Shiri back to us, save the lives of the living hostages, and return all the fallen for burial"", she said,
Her statement came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would ""take revenge"".
""For Ariel and Kfir's sake, and for Yarden's sake, we are not seeking revenge right now,"" Ms Bibas Levy said. ""We are asking for Shiri.""
Ms Bibas Levy said it was ""Israel's responsibility and obligation"" to bring her family members back alive after they were taken hostage during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.
""There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7, and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity,"" she said.
In a statement earlier on Friday, Netanyahu said: ""Ariel, Kfir and Oded: I am so sorry we couldn't save you from the monsters who did this.""

Special Correspondent","From her house in east London, British-Israeli Sharone Lifschitz never gave up hope that her 84-year-old father Oded would return from the horror of Hamas captivity, after more than 500 days.
He was a man of peace, a campaigner for, and a friend of, Palestinians.
He was dragged from his home by Palestinian gunmen on 7 October and killed in captivity after being taken to Gaza alive.
The return of his body on Thursday was devastating news for Ms Lifschitz and her family, particularly her mother Yocheved who was also a hostage but returned alive and now will not be able to reunite with her husband of 63 years.
After identifying Oded's body, the head of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine said he had been killed in captivity more than a year ago. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said he ""was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization.""
The BBC were with Sharone, a filmmaker and academic, at her home when the ceasefire was announced last month.
She shed tears of joy and hope as at last she saw an opportunity where she would discover what had happened to her father. After more than a year of him being held hostage, she didn't know if he was alive or dead.
Sharone Lifschitz admitted then that at his age the hopes for his survival were slim, but she also believed ""miracles can happen"".
Ms Lifschitz has been an eloquent and dignified voice for the release of her father and the other hostages, and shed light on the trauma the hostage families have faced since their ordeal began.
""One way or another, we will know. We will know if he's still with us, if we can look after him. We will know who we are grieving for… My father didn't deserve this.
But she recognised there were ""more graves to come.""
And now, one will be for her father.
Oded Lifshitz was a journalist and veteran campaigner for peace who drove sick Palestinians to hospitals in Israel for treatment. In his campaign for Palestinian rights he met Yasser Arafat, then head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).
He helped to found Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived and was taken hostage from. It was a place where he was well-known for the cacti that he grew, the piano he played and the grandchildren he adored.
In a tribute, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Oded's death, and sent his ""heartfelt condolences"" to his family.
""When I met Sharone in Downing Street, she showed remarkable strength in the face of the most difficult circumstances,"" Sir Keir said.
""The news of her father's death is a tragedy. It is my hope that the peace he worked to see in the region through his charity work and activism will be achieved.""
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the 7 October attacks and 251 others, including Oded and Yocheved, taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
As well as Oded, three other bodies were released by Hamas on Thursday - who Hamas said were Shiri Bibas, 33, and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir.
But on Thursday night, Israel's military accused Hamas of handing over the body of an unidentified person instead of that of Ms Bibas.
""During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage,"" the Israel Defense Forces said.
Oded's wife Yocheved, who was freed as a hostage by Hamas in 2023, met then-Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar while held in the tunnels under Gaza - and told him he should be ashamed of himself.
The British lawyers supporting the family said ""Yocheved must be the only person to have met Sinwar, Netanyahu and the Pope, and given them all a piece of her mind. That is the kind of extraordinary person she is.""
On Wednesday, as she received a peace award for her campaigning for the hostages, she said: ""Oded was a great fighter for peace. He had very good relations with Palestinians and the thing that hurts the most is they betrayed him.""
His family said they could now mourn for a husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather, but after ""503 agonising days of uncertainty"", they had ""hoped and prayed for a different outcome"".",Middle East

Hamas says the bodies are those of a mother and two children from the Bibas family, whose unknown fate has gripped Israel. Israel has confirmed only the identity of the fourth - Oded Lifschitz, 84, a veteran peace activist - after a forensic examination.
President Herzog wrote ""there are no words"" in a post on social media platform X, asking the four for forgiveness ""for not bringing you home safely"".
It is the first time Hamas has returned captives dead since the ceasefire began last month.
Following Hamas's handover of the four bodies, thousands of Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and observed a minute's silence.
Six living hostages are due to be freed on Saturday.
The news that Shiri Bibas, 33, and her sons, who would now be aged five and two, were dead triggered an outpouring of grief across the country.
Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. The Israeli government never confirmed the claim.
Addressing Israelis in a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was ""united in unbearable grief. Every home in Israel bows its head today.
""We all rage over the monsters of Hamas,"" he said.
A lawyer for Dr Sharone Lifschitz, the British-based daughter of Oded Lifschitz, said the day was ""one of immense sadness, and of failure"".
Early on Thursday morning, in choreographed scenes reminiscent of recent handovers of living hostages, four black coffins were laid out on a stage decked with propaganda in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in front of crowds of spectators.
One of the backdrops depicted a ghoulish image of Benjamin Netanyahu with fangs looming over a picture of the four hostages when they were alive. Another read: ""The Return of the War = The Return of your Prisoners in Coffins"".
One of those present, Ikram Abu Salout, told the BBC she was against handing over the bodies. ""They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are.""
A Red Cross official appeared to sign documents at a table alongside armed Hamas fighters before the four coffins transferred to vehicles belonging to the humanitarian organisation.
United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said the handover was ""abhorrent and cruel, and flies in the face of international law"".
""We urge that all returns are conducted in privacy, and with respect and care,"" he added.
The International Committee of the Red Cross echoed his words, saying: ""These operations should be done privately out of the utmost respect for the deceased and for those left grieving.""
After the handover, the bodies were transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza and brought to Israel. People - many with Israeli flags and yellow ones representing the hostages - lined the streets as a police convoy with the coffins passed by. The bodies have been taken to the Abu Kabir forensic institute in Jaffa, Israel, for post-mortems.
The Bibas family, and Oded Lifschtiz and his wife, were among residents taken from kibbutz Nir Oz when hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border with Israel and attacked communities, security forces sites and a music festival.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attack and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Yarden Bibas, 35, was released on 1 February along with two other hostages as part of an exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Oded Lifschitz, a retired journalist, had been held by the armed Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. His wife Yocheved was freed by Hamas on 23 October 2023.
The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January. Israel has confirmed there will be eight.
The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire.
Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.
Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged.
Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.",Middle East

Culture reporter","The culture secretary has said she will raise concerns with BBC bosses about a documentary on Gaza that was narrated by the son of a Hamas official.
The broadcaster has been criticised for Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which centred on a 13-year-old boy who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture.
Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, Israel and others.
The BBC said it had not been informed of the family connection in advance by the film's production company and has apologised ""for the omission of that detail"".
The broadcaster has added a message to the start of the programme on its iPlayer streaming service, making clear the family link, and saying the production team had ""full editorial control"".
Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she would discuss the matter with the BBC's director general and chairman, ""particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme"".
A number of prominent TV figures including actress Tracy-Ann Oberman, Strike producer Neil Blair, former BBC One controller Danny Cohen and producer Leo Pearlman have written to the BBC to call for an investigation.
They said: ""Given the serious nature of these concerns, the BBC should immediately postpone any broadcast repeats of the programme, remove it from iPlayer and take down any social media clips of the programme until an independent investigation is carried out and its findings published with full transparency for licence-fee payers.""
They raised concerns about the ""editorial standards of this programme and the BBC's compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, its own Editorial Guidelines and English law"", and asked the corporation to explain what had happened.
""If the BBC was aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri was the son of a terrorist leader, why was this not disclosed to audiences during the programme?"" they asked.
""If the BBC was not aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri is the son of a terrorist leader, what diligence checks were undertaken and why did they fail?""
The BBC has kept the programme on iPlayer and the new message at the start reads: ""The narrator of this film is 13 year old Abdullah. His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza.
""The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah.""
In a statement, the BBC said: ""Since the transmission of our documentary on Gaza, the BBC has become aware of the family connections of the film's narrator, a child called Abdullah.
""We've promised our audiences the highest standards of transparency, so it is only right that as a result of this new information, we add some more detail to the film before its retransmission. We apologise for the omission of that detail from the original film.""
It added: ""We followed all of our usual compliance procedures in the making of this film, but we had not been informed of this information by the independent producers when we complied and then broadcast the finished film.
""The film remains a powerful child's eye view of the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza which we believe is an invaluable testament to their experiences, and we must meet our commitment to transparency.""
Nandy said the matter was ""a conversation I'll definitely be having with the BBC"".
Speaking to LBC on Thursday, she said: ""I watched it last night. It's something that I will be discussing with them, particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme.
""These things are difficult, and I do want to acknowledge that for the BBC, they take more care than most broadcasters in terms of the way that they try to portray these things. They've been attacked for being too pro-Gaza, they've been attacked for being anti-Gaza. But it is absolutely essential that we get this right.""
The documentary, which aired on BBC Two on Monday, was made by Hoyo Films, which has not commented.",Middle East

BBC News, Tel Aviv","On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.
The return of the dead.
It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.
Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.
But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Missile casings bore the slogan: ""They were killed by US bombs"". Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.
As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.
Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.
The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.
After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.
A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.
Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.
In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.
All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.
Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.
The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.
""We were devastated by the news,"" Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.
""I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking.""
Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.
Oded was 84 years old at the time. He and his wife, Yocheved, were both taken to Khan Younis in Gaza, where they were separated, never to see each other again.
Yocheved was released by Hamas two weeks after the attack.
""We need to close this wound and move forward,"" Yizhar said, adding that his father, a noted journalist and peace activist, had long had a vision about how to resolve the conflicts of the Middle East.
""It's sad that we went through this whole cycle and didn't solve it,"" Yizhar said. ""We left it as something simmering, and look where we are now.""
Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.
In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. It says some have been held for decades.
""I don't like this agreement at all,"" Ikram Abu Salout said in Khan Younis. ""They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are.""
As she was speaking, bulldozers flying Egyptian flags were finally arriving in northern Gaza. Israel allowed the equipment to enter, in exchange for Thursday's handover and the release of six more living hostages this coming Saturday.",Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly48reeg55o,'I cried for days': Office raids and arrests shock aid workers in Yemen,2025-02-20T01:08:10.778Z,"Sally Nabil
BBC Arabic","When Hanaa arrived at work a few months ago, she found ""drawers and doors smashed, and the boss surrounded by security personnel"".
Computers, phones, cameras and documents were all confiscated, her boss was arrested and the organisation's bank account was eventually frozen.
Hanaa works for a US-funded non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Yemen, that supports women's empowerment and trains people to solve problems through negotiation.
But the country's civil war, which has lasted more than a decade and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, has made life for NGO workers increasingly dangerous.
Twenty-four UN employees, along with workers from other local and international NGOs have been detained by Houthi rebels in the past few months.
A wave of arrests in January has intensified the climate of fear - one person from the World Food Programme who was detained died in custody.
The situation has left humanitarian workers feeling their freedom of movement has been greatly restricted. As a result, many organisations, including the UN, are scaling back operations, threatening to make life for people already devastated by war even worse.
Ten years ago, Iranian-backed Houthi militants seized control of much of the west of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the internationally-recognised government. Saudi Arabia, has since carried out intensive air raids on its neighbour - with logistical and intelligence support from the US and UK - to try to prevent the Houthi rebels from taking control of the whole country.
It was Houthi officials who raided Hanaa's office and detained her boss, and she fears retribution if she speaks out. So, for their safety, we have changed the names of Hanaa and others in Yemen who we interviewed for this article.
By cracking down on humanitarian workers, Hanaa believes the Houthis aim to spread fear among the public. But what hurts her deeply is how the public reacted.
""When I checked social media, it was appalling to find out that people see us as spies,"" she says.
A day after her boss was detained, Hanaa was glued to her TV, watching a pro-Houthi channel airing what it described as confessions of espionage, made by nine local people who had once worked at the long-closed US embassy in Sanaa. They were arrested in 2021.
That was the moment she feared things would get worse for her, as she worked for a US-funded NGO. She decided to leave her home in northern Yemen.
By the time she reached the south, she felt traumatised. ""For three days I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stop crying,"" she says.
Now she's worried that US President Donald Trump's decision to re-designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation could lead them to target everyone who works in US-funded projects.
Once someone is arrested, it can be hard for them to get any support, according to Yemeni lawyer Abdulaziz, who represents 14 detainees. They have been behind bars for several months - three are UN staff, while the others are employed by local NGOs. ""During the first three months of detention, my clients didn't communicate with anyone,"" he says.
Abdulaziz is getting increasingly worried that their whereabouts is still unknown. More recently, he says that his clients were able to make a few brief phone calls to their families. ""Each call was between five to 10 minutes,"" he explains.
The BBC approached the Houthis to ask about their treatment of aid workers, but got no reply.
In addition to the detentions, lifesaving assistance from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been paused as a result of President Trump's freeze on the organisation's operations around the world, amid allegations of waste and misuse of funds.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) warns that that the impact of President Trump's policies and the Houthis' arbitrary arrests is ""nothing short of devastating"". It ""will have massive and dramatic impact on aid provision in Yemen"", says Niku Jafarnia, a Yemen and Bahrain researcher at the organisation.
According to HRW, the US was funding about one third of humanitarian aid in Yemen, much of it through USAID. Between 2015 and 2021, it provided more than $3.6 billion, making it the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance in the country, according to the UN.
""Cutting aid would be a death sentence to us,"" warns Amal, a mother of nine. She lives in a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen, alongside thousands of other families.
Even over the phone, it is clear what a heavy burden this woman is carrying. Her slow speech is laden with emotion. It is nearly 10 years since she lost her home.
Amal singlehandedly supports her huge family. Her husband has acute asthma, so he can't work. The family had to flee their hometown further north after the conflict began.
Since then, life has been increasingly unkind to them. The camp, on barren desert land, hardly resembles a home. Their only shelter is a worn-out plastic tent, with no chairs or beds. It is hard for her children to find joy in a place which lacks almost everything.
""If this supply line provided by NGOs is cut, my children might die. We have no jobs, no income, nothing,"" Amal adds.
About half of the population are in bad need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 10 million children, according to the UN children's charity Unicef. The UN Human Development Index lists Yemen as one of the 10 least developed countries in the world.
Amal tells us she receives a monthly food basket from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), but it barely lasts two weeks. When they run out of food, she says her only option is to leave the camp and go out begging in the city's streets. She passes restaurants and shops, hoping for a few loaves of bread or a packet of rice.
""I am covered in shame, but should I leave my children to starve? I am totally helpless,"" Amal explains. Helplessness often takes its toll on her. ""I cry a lot when I realise that I don't have a penny,"" she says, her voice both anguished and bitter.
A large number of children suffer from diarrhoea and pneumonia due to the poor hygiene, malnutrition and miserable living conditions, but adequate medication is rarely available.
At a clinic in northern Yemen, the shelves where medicines should be lie empty. Staff told us the medical stock they have is nothing compared to the people's needs.
The BBC contacted the UN seeking comment on the current aid distribution process and recent arrests but received no reply.
However, addressing the UN Security Council, Hans Grundberg, the UN Special envoy for Yemen, condemned the detention of its staff as ""not only a violation of fundamental human rights, but also a direct threat to the UN's ability to distribute aid to the most needy"". He also called for the immediate release of all detainees, whether from the UN or from other local and international NGOs.
It is for families like Amal's that Hanaa and her co-workers try to make life better.
She proudly remembers how they sent girls to school in one of the conservative northern areas. When parents complained about neighbours being able to see their daughters during break time, ""we held discussions between residents, and eventually agreed to cover the playground, so that girls could go back to class"", she explains.
She fears that the absence of this support, due to fear and lack of funds, could increase rates of illiteracy. ""We are the only ones who have survived during the collapse of the state, in order to serve the people,"" Hanaa says with a sigh.

BBC News","Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group.
The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack.
Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamas earlier this month.
Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned.
In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt.
In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed ""handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family"".
Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives.
An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named.
In a statement, the Bibas family said: ""In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase.
""We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter.
""Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.
Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday.
They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time.
The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day.
They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri.
Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.
Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.
Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel.
But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war.
Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin ""this week"".
He said Israel would ""not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza"" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive.
""If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer,"" Saar said.
A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals.
Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people.
Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave.",Middle East

Reporting fromKfar Kila, southern Lebanon
Raffi Berg
BBC News","Israeli forces have pulled out from towns and villages in southern Lebanon but remain in five locations along the border in what the Lebanese government describes as a violation of a ceasefire deal.
Tuesday marked the end of the deadline for the Israeli withdrawal from the country, which was part of a truce that came into force in November and put an end to 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant and political movement Hezbollah.
The agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, also stipulated the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from southern Lebanon and the deployment of Lebanese soldiers to the area where the group has been the dominant force for decades.
But a day earlier, the Israeli military announced its forces would remain at five ""strategic"" hilltops, until the Lebanese army fully implemented its part of the deal.
It was not clear how long they would stay.
In response to the announcement, Lebanon said Israel must withdraw completely. It said it would consider ""the continued Israeli presence in any inch of Lebanese territory an occupation"".
The truce agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, put an end to 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant and political movement Hezbollah.
Early on Tuesday, Lebanese soldiers moved into the areas vacated by Israeli troops and began clearing roadblocks and checking for unexploded ordnance.
Returning in convoys, residents carried the yellow Hezbollah flag and posters with the face of the group's late leader Hassan Nasrallah.
In Kfar Kila, right next to the border with Israel, no building had not been destroyed or heavily damaged. Families searched the rubble for personal items, but few could have been saved.
""Our house is destroyed just like all the other houses,"" said 25-year-old Safaa Jouma, whose brother was a fighter killed in the war.
""We couldn't save anything. The house was levelled.""
The ceasefire requires Israel to withdraw and for Lebanon's army to replace all armed groups south of the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) north of Israel
Israel's withdrawal had been postponed from the original 60-day deadline - which fell on 26 January - stipulated in the ceasefire.
The positions where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops have been deployed are in mountainous terrain on the edge of the internationally recognised border between Lebanon and Israel.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the IDF was ""temporarily remaining in five strategic high points"", describing it as ""necessary for our security"".
""The IDF's enforcement activities against Hezbollah will continue at full strength. We will not allow a return to the reality of 7 October [2023],"" Saar said, referring to the date when Palestinian Hamas gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza.
Hezbollah had launched its military campaign against Israel the following day, saying it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.
The group was heavily damaged in the conflict, the deadliest fought with Israel since the militant group was formed in 1982.
Lebanese authorities say more than 3,960 people - many of them civilians - were killed during the hostilities, and one million others were displaced from areas where Hezbollah had a strong presence.
Israeli authorities say more than 80 Israeli soldiers and 47 civilians were killed. About 60,000 citizens were displaced from northern Israel.
Most of those displaced in Lebanon have returned home, the UN says, while only a minority of those displaced in Israel have done so, according to reports.",Middle East

BBC News","Detained Britons Craig and Lindsay Foreman have been charged in Iran with espionage, the country's judiciary news agency has said.
Mr and Mrs Foreman were arrested in the city of Kerman in January but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, emerged last week.
Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said that the couple, both aged 52, had ""entered Iran under the guise of tourists"" and ""gathered information in multiple provinces of the country"".
The couple had been on a motorbike trip around the world and had planned to stay in Iran for five days before they were charged with espionage, or spying, by Iranian authorities.
Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe and had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December and were planning to be in Pakistan by 4 January.
In a series of social media posts before they were detained, the couple - who moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Spain in 2019 - described their joy at being in Iran.
Lindsay Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was ""having an amazing time"".
Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the ""lovely people"" of a ""lovely country"".
Announcing the charges, Mr Jahangir said that the couple had been under surveillance by provincial intelligence agencies and were ""subsequently arrested as part of a coordinated intelligence operation"".
He added: ""These individuals were co-operating with front organisations linked to the intelligence services of hostile and Western countries under the pretence of research and investigative activities.""
The chief justice of Kerman province, Hojatoleslam wal-Muslimeen Hamidi, said: ""According to intelligence and security agency monitoring, the connection of these individuals with several institutions affiliated with intelligence services has been confirmed, and further investigations are ongoing.""
Alison Smith, a former neighbour of the couple, described them as ""just normal family people"".
Ms Smith told the BBC she was a ""bit surprised"" by the couple's decision to travel to Iran, but said they probably ""thought they were going to be going on an adventure"".
They had been on ""loads of adventures"" in the past, Ms Smith said.
""They went all over the place,"" she said, describing the pair as ""very sporty, very adventurous"".
The couple had appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia.
A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said ""we are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran"", adding officials are continuing to raise the case ""directly"" with Iranian authorities.
The Foreign Office is providing the detainees with consular assistance and supporting their family members, the spokesperson said.
The Foreign Office's official advice is against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention"".
Having a British passport or connections to the UK ""can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you"", it adds.
In recent years, Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK.
Human rights groups say they are often held as leverage, released only when Iran receives something in return.
Richard Ratcliffe, whose wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran for six years, said Foreign Office travel advice would be ""clearer"" if it reflected the ""risks of hostage-taking"" in the country.",Middle East

BBC World Service","It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it.
For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery.
According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn.
Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.
The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.
The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.
The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.
From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.
Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history.
Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed.
On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition.
The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution.
Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum.
It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene.
The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.
But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.
Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.
Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.
After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.
It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.
Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran.
Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world.
Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it ""one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West"".
The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.
Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.
And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.
But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.
Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.
Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.
Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran.",Middle East

BBC News","The UK government must act ""more promptly"" to help a British couple currently being held in Iran than it did to secure the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, her husband Richard Ratcliffe has said.
Craig and Lindsay Foreman were arrested in January, but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, only emerged earlier this week.
The couple, both aged 52, had been on a motorbike trip across the world and had only planned to be in Iran for five days.
Mr Ratcliffe, whose wife was arrested in Iran in 2016 and not released until six years later, said the dangers of travelling to the country would be ""a lot clearer"" if Foreign Office travel advice reflected ""the risks of hostage-taking"" there.
The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention"".
Having a British passport or connections to the UK ""can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you"", it adds.
The Foreman family said the couple's detention was a ""distressing situation"" and they are ""deeply focused on ensuring their safety and wellbeing during this trying time"".
Responding to the case, Mr Ratcliffe told the PA news agency: ""My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are not in for a long ordeal, and that the government is able to respond more promptly than it did in our case.
""I do think the risks would be a lot clearer to people if the UK travel advice to Iran talked about the risks of hostage-taking. People would be more alert to the fact that it is not personal, and it doesn't matter whether you have travelled there with a good heart.""
Posting on Instagram before being detained, Mrs Foreman acknowledged travelling to Iran, against Foreign Office advice, and to Pakistan was risky and ""slightly scary"".
But she wrote ""we know the rewards of meeting incredible people, hearing their stories, and seeing the breathtaking landscapes of these regions could far outweigh the fear"".
Mr Ratcliffe said the ""top priority"" for the UK government should be ensuring Mr and Mrs Foreman were not being held in solitary confinement, because it was ""important they do not feel alone"".
He added a court process in the case may happen soon but said: ""It's not a real court... it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government's attention. And it will hurt much the same. I really hope they will be okay.""
The UK Foreign Office did not respond directly to Mr Ratcliffe's comments when approached by BBC News, but said it was providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran and is in contact with the local authorities.
Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian national, was arrested at an airport in Tehran in April 2016 and accused of spying charges, which she denied.
Mr Ratcliffe went on hunger strike twice as part of his campaign for his wife's release.
She was ultimately freed and returned to Britain in March 2022 after the UK government agreed to settle a £400m debt dating back to the 1970s.
Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe and had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December. They planned to be in Pakistan by 4 January.
After staying in the cities of Tabriz, Tehran and Isfahan, accompanied by a tour guide, they travelled on to Kerman, in east-central Iran, but never checked into their hotel there.
The Iranian authorities have not said what the couple are accused of.
In a series of social media posts before they were detained, the pair described their joy at being in Iran.
Mrs Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was ""having an amazing time"". Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the ""lovely people"" of a ""lovely country"".
The couple had moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Andalucia, Spain, in 2019 and appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats.
Mrs Foreman is reported to have been carrying out a research project on their journey to Australia, asking people what it means to be human and what constitutes a good life.

Middle East correspondent, BBC World Service
Reporting fromSyria","Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria.
The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks.
Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war.
Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its ""security belt"" against Israel.
We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups.
From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base.
A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi - named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024.
The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria.
The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation.
""Iranians were here. They all fled,"" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. ""Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods.""
Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated.
The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf.
They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria.
Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian ""military advisers"" and their Iranian commanders.
Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was ""to fight against jihadi groups"" and to protect ""Shia holy shrines"" against radical Sunni militants.
It created paramilitary groups of mainly Afghan, Pakistani and Iraqi fighters.
Yet, when the final moment came, Iran was unprepared. Orders for retreat reached some bases at the very last moment. ""Developments happened so fast,"" a senior member of an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group tells me. ""The order was to just take your backpack and leave.""
Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians.
An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus.
He says they thought their operation would take ""about a year"" and best, they'd ""capture Aleppo in three to six months"". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days.
The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.
That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally – the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike.
This ""situation of psychological collapse"" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat.
But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says.
""There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel.""
As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters.
On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: ""Down with Israel"" and ""Down with the USA"".
It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as ""highly sensitive"".
Abdullah, 65, and his family are among the very few locals who stayed and lived here alongside the IRGC-led groups. He says this life was hard.
His house is only a few metres away from the headquarters and in between, there are deep trenches with barbed wire.
""Movement at night was prohibited,"" he says.
His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. ""They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects,"" he recalls.
Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. ""They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them.""
Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the ""Iranian militias"" have left, but still remembers the ""stressful"" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then ""they just vanished in a few hours"".
""This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,"" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base.
I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians.
I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was.
""Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,"" he explained.
This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran.
The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians.
Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed.
The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory.
While supreme leader Ali Khamenei called on ""Syrian youths"" to ""resist"" those who ""have brought instability"" to Syria, Iran's foreign ministry has taken a more balanced view.
It says the country ""backs any government supported by the Syrian people"".
In one of his first interviews, Syria's new leader Sharaa described their victory over Assad as an ""end of the Iranian project"". But he hasn't ruled out having a ""balanced"" relationship with Tehran.
For the moment, though, Iran is not welcome in Syria. After years of expanding its military presence, everything Tehran built is now in ruins, both on the battlefield and, it seems, in the eyes of a large part of Syria's public.
Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh.
But left behind now is evidence of a brief fight - a few bullet shells and a military uniform covered with blood.",Middle East

BBC News","Hamas has released another three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners following a week in which the fragile ceasefire deal appeared under threat.
American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29, were freed in return for 369 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
So far 19 hostages and more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been freed in the first phase of ceasefire deal which began on 19 January.
The swap came days after Hamas said it would pause the release of hostages, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the deal - an allegation denied by Israel.
Israel, backed by US President Donald Trump, said ""intense"" fighting would resume unless the hostages were handed over. Hamas later said it remained committed to the ceasefire, and that Israel was ""responsible for any complications or delays"".
But on Saturday the sixth swap went ahead, with the hostages handed over to Red Cross workers in a highly-choreographed public show in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
Surrounded by heavily armed Hamas militants, the men briefly addressed a crowd of Palestinians before being transferred into Red Cross vehicles.
They did not look as gaunt as the hostages freed a week earlier - their appearance had aroused anger in Israel and elsewhere.
Under the first six-week stage of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are supposed to be freed.
The three men were airlifted by military helicopters to a hospital in central Israel, where they underwent medical tests and were reunited with relatives.
Yair Horn and his brother Eitan, 37, had been abducted from a kibbutz during the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas. Eitan remains in captivity in Gaza.
Pictures showed Yair Horn hugging his mother and his brother Amos in hospital, and a message where he wrote ""Eitan, you're next"".
US citizen Sagui Dekel-Chen also reunited with his wife, where he learned that he had one-year-old daughter. His wife had been eight months pregnant with their third child when he was captured by Hamas in October 2023.
US President Donald Trump marked the hostage release on Saturday, noting Hamas had not followed through with their threat.
""They seem to be in good shape,"" he said.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog, posting on social media, said the hostages had been ""forced to endure"" a ""despicable and cynical ceremony"".
In a social media post, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to work with the US to ""ensure that all hostages return to Israel soon"".
The majority of the freed Palestinians were taken to Gaza, although some were taken to the West Bank. In both areas, crowds gathered to welcome the former prisoners.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society told the BBC that five of those released in the West Bank city of Ramallah were taken straight to hospital.
""They all have chronic illnesses,"" said Mohammad Faqih, an official from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, adding that one man had a broken leg.
Most of the 36 Palestinians serving life sentences will reportedly be deported to Egypt.
The latest releases mean that under the ceasefire, Hamas is due to free another 14 hostages.
However Israel says eight are of them are dead, meaning six living Israelis are still expected to be returned in the first phase.
A total of 141 hostages have now been freed, including 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals released as part of a previous deal between Israel and Hamas.
About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.
This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",Middle East

BBC News","The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon says its outgoing deputy commander has been injured after one of its convoys was ""violently attacked"".
The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said in a statement that the convoy was taking peacekeepers to Beirut airport when it was targeted and one of its vehicles set on fire.
Protesters have been blocking the road to the airport following a decision by the Lebanese government to bar two Iranian planes from landing.
Both Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun and the country's army condemned the attack on Unifil, and said they would work to arrest those involved.
Several videos shared online show one white UN vehicle alight, as a group of young men, carrying yellow flags, chase and beat what appear to be peacekeepers as they attempt to flee.
Separate footage shows a group of men shouting as they kick, hit and climb onto a convoy of three UN vehicles along a dark road.
Unifil's injured deputy commander, who was not named, was returning home after ending his mission, according to a statement from the United Nations.
""We are shocked by this outrageous attack on peacekeepers who have been serving to restore security and stability to south Lebanon during a difficult time,"" it added.
""Attacks on peacekeepers are flagrant violations of international law and may amount to war crimes. We demand a full and immediate investigation by Lebanese authorities and for all perpetrators to be brought to justice.""
Aoun said the attack was ""unacceptable"" and ""cannot be allowed to be repeated"".
In a social media post from the presidency, he added: ""The security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to destabilize and undermine civil peace in the country.""
Supporters of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah have gathered outside Beirut's airport since Thursday over a stand-off between Lebanon and Iran that saw two Iranian planes barred from landing in the Lebanese capital.
It has left dozens of Lebanese nationals stranded in Iran.
The measure was put in place after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that Iran's Quds Force had been ""exploiting"" international flights to ""smuggle"" funds to arm Hezbollah.
The IDF's Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said it was in contact with the committee monitoring the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, but alleged: ""Despite the efforts made, we estimate that some of these money smuggling attempts have succeeded.""
The Amal movement, a group allied to Hezbollah, said ""the attack on Unifil is an attack on southern Lebanon"", and described it as ""a stab at civil peace"".
Lebanese Interior Minister Ahmed Al-Hajjar told state media he would convene a security meeting on Saturday in light of the attack, calling it a ""crime against peacekeeping forces"".

BBC News","Hamas has released the names of three hostages due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, after days of fears over the future of the ceasefire.
They are Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, Argentine-Israeli Yair Horn, and US-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen.
Israel has said it will resume bombing if the three are not released on time. The warning came after Hamas said it was postponing the releases in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire.
President Trump said the ceasefire should be scrapped if Hamas did not release all the hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday.
Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 766 prisoners.
During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages should be freed in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel.
The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.
More than 48,230 people have been killed by the Israel offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
There are 73 hostages taken on 7 October who are still being held in Gaza. There are also three other Israeli hostages - one of whom is dead - who have been held in Gaza for a decade or more.
Alexander Troufanov, 29, Yair Horn, 46, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, were all seized from Kibbutz Nir Oz on the edge of Gaza.
The ceasefire has been under strain since it began, with each side taking reciprocal action over alleged violations. Intense efforts by mediators US, Egypt and Qatar have managed to stop it from collapsing.
Israel has been especially infuriated by the staged way hostages have been released - publicly displayed on platforms alongside gunmen and in front of crowds of spectators, before being handed over to the Red Cross in chaotic scenes.
For its part, Hamas has accused Israel of preventing what the group says are the amount of tents and aid lorries required to be let into Gaza under the terms of the ceasefire. Israel denies this.
Meanwhile the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published video of what it said was a rocket fired at Israel from Gaza on Thursday. It said the rocket failed and landed inside Gaza. A source in the Hamas-run police said the rocket was an unexploded Israeli ordinance that had fired into the air while it was being moved away, Reuters news agency reported.
